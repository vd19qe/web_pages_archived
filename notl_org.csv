The responsibility to contact the selected business and subsequent community partner is the responsibility of those in need. Orders can be placed online or by phone. We ask that these services only be used when all other options have been exhausted. It is essential that physical distancing guidelines are adhered to during every delivery, and at all times.

We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter. Please be advised the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the Lake, at its meeting on April 6, 2020, approved the following: BE IT RESOLVED That, pursuant to Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law No. 4634-13, Council hereby delegates authority to the Director of Community & Development Services that in the event any party operating short term accommodation fails to comply with the order to cease operation under Ontario Regulation 82/20 – Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses – under Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that the Director shall have the authority: 1) to revoke any related license, if any, to operate a Short Term Rental and 2) preclude the holder of the license or any party operating such facility from applying for a license or a reinstatement for 1 year from the later of the date of the cessation order or the revocation of the license, and 3) impose a fine of no more than $750 or such increased amount as the Province may set for every day on which they operate after the date of the cessation order. The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of hotels, motels and student residences. In order to exercise this privilege a person operating short term rental must submit the following information to the Director of Community & Development Services by email at craig.larmour@notl.com: Business name; Contact information for owner (email and cell phone); Number and names of person(s) proposed to be housed; Proposed occupant’s contact information (email and cell phone); Make, model and licence plate of proposed occupant’s vehicle(s); Home address for proposed occupant(s); Why proposed occupant is in need of housing; Date of proposed occupant’s arrival; and Length of proposed rental arrangement. Be advised that failure to provide all of the above noted information in advance of the short term rental being occupied will result in: levying of the referenced fine; revocation of the related license; and 1 year delay in ability to apply for reinstatement. To review all Town updates related to COVID-19, read answers to frequently asked questions, and see up-to-date information on the status of Town services, please visit www.notl.com/COVID-19, or call 905-468-3266.

Sincerely, Peter Todd Betty Disero Town Clerk Lord Mayor ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ April 2, 2020 RE: Short Term Rental Accommodations During COVID-19 The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A copy of the Order may be viewed online at, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200082 Schedule 2 to the Regulation identifies seventy-four (74) essential businesses, including: 12. Hotels, motels, shared rental units and similar facilities, including student residences Please be advised that the Town does not consider Short Term Rental accommodations to fall within the scope of this essential business; consequently, the Town requires that you cease operations immediately. If compliance with this direction is not achieved by Monday, April 6, 2020, Council will consider further action. To this end, please be advised that on Friday, March 27, 2020, the Honourable Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing empowered local by-law enforcement officers to enforce Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act Orders under the Provincial Offences Act. Offences and set fines available to enforcement personnel include: Fail to comply with an emergency order $750.00 Obstruct any person exercising a power in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 Obstruct any person performing a duty in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 If you’re aware of a Short Term Rental (also known as a Bed & Breakfast, Air B&B, Country Inn, Cottage Rental, and Vacation Apartment) operating in contravention of the above requirement, please advise Niagara-on-the-Lake’s By-law Enforcement immediately. Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate). The Town will be issuing refunds, in the amount of the additional balance, to operators who have already provided payment for their 2020 license fee. Cheques will be sent by mail as soon as they are processed. Operators who have yet to provide payment for the 2020 licensing year may do so upon revocation of Ontario Regulation 82/20, Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. The application fee will be $115.00/room (2019 rate). Operators wishing to cancel their 2020 license and receive a refund may do so by providing a notice in writing stating that they have not yet operated in this calendar year. Applicants must request a refund no later than June 1, 2020. Please note that at this time, all Short Term Rental inspections have been cancelled. If you are impacted by this change, please be advised that Town staff will be in contact with you in the near future to reschedule your inspection. While we understand that discontinuing the operation of your Short Term Rental may cause additional financial strain during an already difficult time, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks for doing your part to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Niagara-on-the-Lake. We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter.

We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter. Please be advised the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the Lake, at its meeting on April 6, 2020, approved the following: BE IT RESOLVED That, pursuant to Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law No. 4634-13, Council hereby delegates authority to the Director of Community & Development Services that in the event any party operating short term accommodation fails to comply with the order to cease operation under Ontario Regulation 82/20 – Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses – under Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that the Director shall have the authority: 1) to revoke any related license, if any, to operate a Short Term Rental and 2) preclude the holder of the license or any party operating such facility from applying for a license or a reinstatement for 1 year from the later of the date of the cessation order or the revocation of the license, and 3) impose a fine of no more than $750 or such increased amount as the Province may set for every day on which they operate after the date of the cessation order. The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of hotels, motels and student residences. In order to exercise this privilege a person operating short term rental must submit the following information to the Director of Community & Development Services by email at craig.larmour@notl.com: Business name; Contact information for owner (email and cell phone); Number and names of person(s) proposed to be housed; Proposed occupant’s contact information (email and cell phone); Make, model and licence plate of proposed occupant’s vehicle(s); Home address for proposed occupant(s); Why proposed occupant is in need of housing; Date of proposed occupant’s arrival; and Length of proposed rental arrangement. Be advised that failure to provide all of the above noted information in advance of the short term rental being occupied will result in: levying of the referenced fine; revocation of the related license; and 1 year delay in ability to apply for reinstatement.

Sincerely, Peter Todd Betty Disero Town Clerk Lord Mayor ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ April 2, 2020 RE: Short Term Rental Accommodations During COVID-19 The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A copy of the Order may be viewed online at, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200082 Schedule 2 to the Regulation identifies seventy-four (74) essential businesses, including: 12. Hotels, motels, shared rental units and similar facilities, including student residences Please be advised that the Town does not consider Short Term Rental accommodations to fall within the scope of this essential business; consequently, the Town requires that you cease operations immediately. If compliance with this direction is not achieved by Monday, April 6, 2020, Council will consider further action. To this end, please be advised that on Friday, March 27, 2020, the Honourable Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing empowered local by-law enforcement officers to enforce Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act Orders under the Provincial Offences Act. Offences and set fines available to enforcement personnel include: Fail to comply with an emergency order $750.00 Obstruct any person exercising a power in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 Obstruct any person performing a duty in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 If you’re aware of a Short Term Rental (also known as a Bed & Breakfast, Air B&B, Country Inn, Cottage Rental, and Vacation Apartment) operating in contravention of the above requirement, please advise Niagara-on-the-Lake’s By-law Enforcement immediately. Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate). The Town will be issuing refunds, in the amount of the additional balance, to operators who have already provided payment for their 2020 license fee. Cheques will be sent by mail as soon as they are processed. Operators who have yet to provide payment for the 2020 licensing year may do so upon revocation of Ontario Regulation 82/20, Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. The application fee will be $115.00/room (2019 rate). Operators wishing to cancel their 2020 license and receive a refund may do so by providing a notice in writing stating that they have not yet operated in this calendar year. Applicants must request a refund no later than June 1, 2020. Please note that at this time, all Short Term Rental inspections have been cancelled. If you are impacted by this change, please be advised that Town staff will be in contact with you in the near future to reschedule your inspection. While we understand that discontinuing the operation of your Short Term Rental may cause additional financial strain during an already difficult time, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks for doing your part to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Niagara-on-the-Lake. We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter.

We ask that these services only be used when all other options have been exhausted. It is essential that physical distancing guidelines are adhered to during every delivery, and at all times.

We, therefore, have coordinated with a number of businesses and community groups to help get essential supplies and groceries to our residents in need. See below for details. The responsibility to contact the selected business and subsequent community partner is the responsibility of those in need. Orders can be placed online or by phone. We ask that these services only be used when all other options have been exhausted. It is essential that physical distancing guidelines are adhered to during every delivery, and at all times. Please be assured that food supplies remain stable. Grocers are encouraging patrons to continue their normal purchasing behaviour – rather than excessively stocking up – to ensure no one runs short of necessities. Pharmaceuticals will not be delivered by our community partners. The Town does not endorse any entity listed but provides this information as a public service. Several grocery stores in Niagara are opening their doors early for seniors and those with other health concerns to give them an opportunity to shop with fewer customers around amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Make sure to check with your favourite store before venturing out.

We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter. Please be advised the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the Lake, at its meeting on April 6, 2020, approved the following: BE IT RESOLVED That, pursuant to Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law No. 4634-13, Council hereby delegates authority to the Director of Community & Development Services that in the event any party operating short term accommodation fails to comply with the order to cease operation under Ontario Regulation 82/20 – Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses – under Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that the Director shall have the authority: 1) to revoke any related license, if any, to operate a Short Term Rental and 2) preclude the holder of the license or any party operating such facility from applying for a license or a reinstatement for 1 year from the later of the date of the cessation order or the revocation of the license, and 3) impose a fine of no more than $750 or such increased amount as the Province may set for every day on which they operate after the date of the cessation order. The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of hotels, motels and student residences. In order to exercise this privilege a person operating short term rental must submit the following information to the Director of Community & Development Services by email at craig.larmour@notl.com: Business name; Contact information for owner (email and cell phone); Number and names of person(s) proposed to be housed; Proposed occupant’s contact information (email and cell phone); Make, model and licence plate of proposed occupant’s vehicle(s); Home address for proposed occupant(s); Why proposed occupant is in need of housing; Date of proposed occupant’s arrival; and Length of proposed rental arrangement. Be advised that failure to provide all of the above noted information in advance of the short term rental being occupied will result in: levying of the referenced fine; revocation of the related license; and 1 year delay in ability to apply for reinstatement. To review all Town updates related to COVID-19, read answers to frequently asked questions, and see up-to-date information on the status of Town services, please visit www.notl.com/COVID-19, or call 905-468-3266. Phones are being answered between the hours of 8:30 AM and 4:30 PM Monday to Friday, and online service requests remain available at www.notl.org/content/service-request. Town Staff will continue to assist and serve citizens online and over the phone. Visit www.canada.ca/coronavirus for the most up to date information from the Federal Government. Sincerely, Peter Todd Betty Disero Town Clerk Lord Mayor ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ April 2, 2020 RE: Short Term Rental Accommodations During COVID-19 The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A copy of the Order may be viewed online at, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200082 Schedule 2 to the Regulation identifies seventy-four (74) essential businesses, including: 12. Hotels, motels, shared rental units and similar facilities, including student residences Please be advised that the Town does not consider Short Term Rental accommodations to fall within the scope of this essential business; consequently, the Town requires that you cease operations immediately. If compliance with this direction is not achieved by Monday, April 6, 2020, Council will consider further action. To this end, please be advised that on Friday, March 27, 2020, the Honourable Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing empowered local by-law enforcement officers to enforce Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act Orders under the Provincial Offences Act. Offences and set fines available to enforcement personnel include: Fail to comply with an emergency order $750.00 Obstruct any person exercising a power in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 Obstruct any person performing a duty in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 If you’re aware of a Short Term Rental (also known as a Bed & Breakfast, Air B&B, Country Inn, Cottage Rental, and Vacation Apartment) operating in contravention of the above requirement, please advise Niagara-on-the-Lake’s By-law Enforcement immediately. Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate). The Town will be issuing refunds, in the amount of the additional balance, to operators who have already provided payment for their 2020 license fee. Cheques will be sent by mail as soon as they are processed.

Please be advised the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the Lake, at its meeting on April 6, 2020, approved the following: BE IT RESOLVED That, pursuant to Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law No. 4634-13, Council hereby delegates authority to the Director of Community & Development Services that in the event any party operating short term accommodation fails to comply with the order to cease operation under Ontario Regulation 82/20 – Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses – under Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that the Director shall have the authority: 1) to revoke any related license, if any, to operate a Short Term Rental and 2) preclude the holder of the license or any party operating such facility from applying for a license or a reinstatement for 1 year from the later of the date of the cessation order or the revocation of the license, and 3) impose a fine of no more than $750 or such increased amount as the Province may set for every day on which they operate after the date of the cessation order. The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period.

A copy of the Order may be viewed online at, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200082 Schedule 2 to the Regulation identifies seventy-four (74) essential businesses, including: 12. Hotels, motels, shared rental units and similar facilities, including student residences Please be advised that the Town does not consider Short Term Rental accommodations to fall within the scope of this essential business; consequently, the Town requires that you cease operations immediately. If compliance with this direction is not achieved by Monday, April 6, 2020, Council will consider further action. To this end, please be advised that on Friday, March 27, 2020, the Honourable Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing empowered local by-law enforcement officers to enforce Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act Orders under the Provincial Offences Act. Offences and set fines available to enforcement personnel include: Fail to comply with an emergency order $750.00 Obstruct any person exercising a power in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 Obstruct any person performing a duty in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 If you’re aware of a Short Term Rental (also known as a Bed & Breakfast, Air B&B, Country Inn, Cottage Rental, and Vacation Apartment) operating in contravention of the above requirement, please advise Niagara-on-the-Lake’s By-law Enforcement immediately. Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate). The Town will be issuing refunds, in the amount of the additional balance, to operators who have already provided payment for their 2020 license fee.

We, therefore, have coordinated with a number of businesses and community groups to help get essential supplies and groceries to our residents in need. See below for details. The responsibility to contact the selected business and subsequent community partner is the responsibility of those in need. Orders can be placed online or by phone. We ask that these services only be used when all other options have been exhausted. It is essential that physical distancing guidelines are adhered to during every delivery, and at all times. Please be assured that food supplies remain stable. Grocers are encouraging patrons to continue their normal purchasing behaviour – rather than excessively stocking up – to ensure no one runs short of necessities. Pharmaceuticals will not be delivered by our community partners. The Town does not endorse any entity listed but provides this information as a public service. Several grocery stores in Niagara are opening their doors early for seniors and those with other health concerns to give them an opportunity to shop with fewer customers around amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Make sure to check with your favourite store before venturing out.

We, therefore, have coordinated with a number of businesses and community groups to help get essential supplies and groceries to our residents in need. See below for details. The responsibility to contact the selected business and subsequent community partner is the responsibility of those in need. Orders can be placed online or by phone. We ask that these services only be used when all other options have been exhausted. It is essential that physical distancing guidelines are adhered to during every delivery, and at all times. Please be assured that food supplies remain stable. Grocers are encouraging patrons to continue their normal purchasing behaviour – rather than excessively stocking up – to ensure no one runs short of necessities. Pharmaceuticals will not be delivered by our community partners. The Town does not endorse any entity listed but provides this information as a public service. Several grocery stores in Niagara are opening their doors early for seniors and those with other health concerns to give them an opportunity to shop with fewer customers around amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Make sure to check with your favourite store before venturing out.

We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter. Please be advised the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the Lake, at its meeting on April 6, 2020, approved the following: BE IT RESOLVED That, pursuant to Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law No. 4634-13, Council hereby delegates authority to the Director of Community & Development Services that in the event any party operating short term accommodation fails to comply with the order to cease operation under Ontario Regulation 82/20 – Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses – under Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that the Director shall have the authority: 1) to revoke any related license, if any, to operate a Short Term Rental and 2) preclude the holder of the license or any party operating such facility from applying for a license or a reinstatement for 1 year from the later of the date of the cessation order or the revocation of the license, and 3) impose a fine of no more than $750 or such increased amount as the Province may set for every day on which they operate after the date of the cessation order. The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of hotels, motels and student residences. In order to exercise this privilege a person operating short term rental must submit the following information to the Director of Community & Development Services by email at craig.larmour@notl.com: Business name; Contact information for owner (email and cell phone); Number and names of person(s) proposed to be housed; Proposed occupant’s contact information (email and cell phone); Make, model and licence plate of proposed occupant’s vehicle(s); Home address for proposed occupant(s); Why proposed occupant is in need of housing; Date of proposed occupant’s arrival; and Length of proposed rental arrangement. Be advised that failure to provide all of the above noted information in advance of the short term rental being occupied will result in: levying of the referenced fine; revocation of the related license; and 1 year delay in ability to apply for reinstatement. To review all Town updates related to COVID-19, read answers to frequently asked questions, and see up-to-date information on the status of Town services, please visit www.notl.com/COVID-19, or call 905-468-3266.

Sincerely, Peter Todd Betty Disero Town Clerk Lord Mayor ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ April 2, 2020 RE: Short Term Rental Accommodations During COVID-19 The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A copy of the Order may be viewed online at, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200082 Schedule 2 to the Regulation identifies seventy-four (74) essential businesses, including: 12. Hotels, motels, shared rental units and similar facilities, including student residences Please be advised that the Town does not consider Short Term Rental accommodations to fall within the scope of this essential business; consequently, the Town requires that you cease operations immediately.

We, therefore, have coordinated with a number of businesses and community groups to help get essential supplies and groceries to our residents in need. See below for details. The responsibility to contact the selected business and subsequent community partner is the responsibility of those in need. Orders can be placed online or by phone. We ask that these services only be used when all other options have been exhausted. It is essential that physical distancing guidelines are adhered to during every delivery, and at all times. Please be assured that food supplies remain stable. Grocers are encouraging patrons to continue their normal purchasing behaviour – rather than excessively stocking up – to ensure no one runs short of necessities. Pharmaceuticals will not be delivered by our community partners. The Town does not endorse any entity listed but provides this information as a public service. Several grocery stores in Niagara are opening their doors early for seniors and those with other health concerns to give them an opportunity to shop with fewer customers around amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Make sure to check with your favourite store before venturing out.

We, therefore, have coordinated with a number of businesses and community groups to help get essential supplies and groceries to our residents in need. See below for details. The responsibility to contact the selected business and subsequent community partner is the responsibility of those in need. Orders can be placed online or by phone. We ask that these services only be used when all other options have been exhausted. It is essential that physical distancing guidelines are adhered to during every delivery, and at all times. Please be assured that food supplies remain stable. Grocers are encouraging patrons to continue their normal purchasing behaviour – rather than excessively stocking up – to ensure no one runs short of necessities. Pharmaceuticals will not be delivered by our community partners. The Town does not endorse any entity listed but provides this information as a public service. Several grocery stores in Niagara are opening their doors early for seniors and those with other health concerns to give them an opportunity to shop with fewer customers around amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On June 4, 2020, the Provincial Government revised Ontario Regulation 82/20 to remove the limitations on the operation of Short Term Rentals. Consequently, all Short Term Rentals are now permitted to operate in a similar manner as to hotels and motels, subject to compliance with all other Regulations and/or industry guidelines (e.g. physical distancing). Thank you to all operators who complied with the Provincial Emergency Orders and Council resolution. We are thankful that you willingly set aside your personal interests in order to assist in the protection of public generally, and our residents specifically. For all operators who wish to operate in 2020 and have yet to pay their annual license fee, payment is required by Tuesday, June 30th. At this time payments may be provided by cheque in the drop off box located at the Municipal Office (1593 Four Mile Creek Road, Virgil), by mail, or through online banking. Please make cheques out to The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake and ensure envelopes are addressed to: Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, 1593 Four Mile Creek Road, PO Box 100, Virgil ON L0S 1T0 For all operators who are in the process of renewing their 2020 license and require inspections, please contact Marilena Basilone via email (Marilena.Basilone@notl.com), or by phone (905-468-3266) to book.

On June 4, 2020, the Provincial Government revised Ontario Regulation 82/20 to remove the limitations on the operation of Short Term Rentals. Consequently, all Short Term Rentals are now permitted to operate in a similar manner as to hotels and motels, subject to compliance with all other Regulations and/or industry guidelines (e.g. physical distancing). Thank you to all operators who complied with the Provincial Emergency Orders and Council resolution. We are thankful that you willingly set aside your personal interests in order to assist in the protection of public generally, and our residents specifically. For all operators who wish to operate in 2020 and have yet to pay their annual license fee, payment is required by Tuesday, June 30th. At this time payments may be provided by cheque in the drop off box located at the Municipal Office (1593 Four Mile Creek Road, Virgil), by mail, or through online banking. Please make cheques out to The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake and ensure envelopes are addressed to: Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, 1593 Four Mile Creek Road, PO Box 100, Virgil ON L0S 1T0 For all operators who are in the process of renewing their 2020 license and require inspections, please contact Marilena Basilone via email (Marilena.Basilone@notl.com), or by phone (905-468-3266) to book. We ask for your continued patience as there may be a longer then normal wait time to book inspections or to receive your license. If you have recently cancelled or renewed your insurance, a new Certificate of Insurance must be submitted prior to operation. All operators must ensure their services meet physical distancing requirements and all other Provincial Emergency Orders, and Public Health guidelines in effect. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 related measures being taken by Niagara-on-the-Lake, please visit notl.com/COVID-19, or call 905-468-3266.

We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter. Please be advised the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the Lake, at its meeting on April 6, 2020, approved the following: BE IT RESOLVED That, pursuant to Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law No. 4634-13, Council hereby delegates authority to the Director of Community & Development Services that in the event any party operating short term accommodation fails to comply with the order to cease operation under Ontario Regulation 82/20 – Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses – under Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that the Director shall have the authority: 1) to revoke any related license, if any, to operate a Short Term Rental and 2) preclude the holder of the license or any party operating such facility from applying for a license or a reinstatement for 1 year from the later of the date of the cessation order or the revocation of the license, and 3) impose a fine of no more than $750 or such increased amount as the Province may set for every day on which they operate after the date of the cessation order. The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of hotels, motels and student residences. In order to exercise this privilege a person operating short term rental must submit the following information to the Director of Community & Development Services by email at craig.larmour@notl.com: Business name; Contact information for owner (email and cell phone); Number and names of person(s) proposed to be housed; Proposed occupant’s contact information (email and cell phone); Make, model and licence plate of proposed occupant’s vehicle(s); Home address for proposed occupant(s); Why proposed occupant is in need of housing; Date of proposed occupant’s arrival; and Length of proposed rental arrangement. Be advised that failure to provide all of the above noted information in advance of the short term rental being occupied will result in: levying of the referenced fine; revocation of the related license; and 1 year delay in ability to apply for reinstatement. To review all Town updates related to COVID-19, read answers to frequently asked questions, and see up-to-date information on the status of Town services, please visit www.notl.com/COVID-19, or call 905-468-3266.

Sincerely, Peter Todd Betty Disero Town Clerk Lord Mayor ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ April 2, 2020 RE: Short Term Rental Accommodations During COVID-19 The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A copy of the Order may be viewed online at, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200082 Schedule 2 to the Regulation identifies seventy-four (74) essential businesses, including: 12. Hotels, motels, shared rental units and similar facilities, including student residences Please be advised that the Town does not consider Short Term Rental accommodations to fall within the scope of this essential business; consequently, the Town requires that you cease operations immediately. If compliance with this direction is not achieved by Monday, April 6, 2020, Council will consider further action. To this end, please be advised that on Friday, March 27, 2020, the Honourable Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing empowered local by-law enforcement officers to enforce Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act Orders under the Provincial Offences Act. Offences and set fines available to enforcement personnel include: Fail to comply with an emergency order $750.00 Obstruct any person exercising a power in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 Obstruct any person performing a duty in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 If you’re aware of a Short Term Rental (also known as a Bed & Breakfast, Air B&B, Country Inn, Cottage Rental, and Vacation Apartment) operating in contravention of the above requirement, please advise Niagara-on-the-Lake’s By-law Enforcement immediately. Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate).

On June 4, 2020, the Provincial Government revised Ontario Regulation 82/20 to remove the limitations on the operation of Short Term Rentals. Consequently, all Short Term Rentals are now permitted to operate in a similar manner as to hotels and motels, subject to compliance with all other Regulations and/or industry guidelines (e.g. physical distancing). Thank you to all operators who complied with the Provincial Emergency Orders and Council resolution. We are thankful that you willingly set aside your personal interests in order to assist in the protection of public generally, and our residents specifically. For all operators who wish to operate in 2020 and have yet to pay their annual license fee, payment is required by Tuesday, June 30th. At this time payments may be provided by cheque in the drop off box located at the Municipal Office (1593 Four Mile Creek Road, Virgil), by mail, or through online banking. Please make cheques out to The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake and ensure envelopes are addressed to: Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, 1593 Four Mile Creek Road, PO Box 100, Virgil ON L0S 1T0 For all operators who are in the process of renewing their 2020 license and require inspections, please contact Marilena Basilone via email (Marilena.Basilone@notl.com), or by phone (905-468-3266) to book. We ask for your continued patience as there may be a longer then normal wait time to book inspections or to receive your license. If you have recently cancelled or renewed your insurance, a new Certificate of Insurance must be submitted prior to operation. All operators must ensure their services meet physical distancing requirements and all other Provincial Emergency Orders, and Public Health guidelines in effect.

We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter. Please be advised the Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the Lake, at its meeting on April 6, 2020, approved the following: BE IT RESOLVED That, pursuant to Niagara-on-the-Lake By-law No. 4634-13, Council hereby delegates authority to the Director of Community & Development Services that in the event any party operating short term accommodation fails to comply with the order to cease operation under Ontario Regulation 82/20 – Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses – under Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that the Director shall have the authority: 1) to revoke any related license, if any, to operate a Short Term Rental and 2) preclude the holder of the license or any party operating such facility from applying for a license or a reinstatement for 1 year from the later of the date of the cessation order or the revocation of the license, and 3) impose a fine of no more than $750 or such increased amount as the Province may set for every day on which they operate after the date of the cessation order. The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of hotels, motels and student residences. In order to exercise this privilege a person operating short term rental must submit the following information to the Director of Community & Development Services by email at craig.larmour@notl.com: Business name; Contact information for owner (email and cell phone); Number and names of person(s) proposed to be housed; Proposed occupant’s contact information (email and cell phone); Make, model and licence plate of proposed occupant’s vehicle(s); Home address for proposed occupant(s); Why proposed occupant is in need of housing; Date of proposed occupant’s arrival; and Length of proposed rental arrangement. Be advised that failure to provide all of the above noted information in advance of the short term rental being occupied will result in: levying of the referenced fine; revocation of the related license; and 1 year delay in ability to apply for reinstatement.

If compliance with this direction is not achieved by Monday, April 6, 2020, Council will consider further action. To this end, please be advised that on Friday, March 27, 2020, the Honourable Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing empowered local by-law enforcement officers to enforce Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act Orders under the Provincial Offences Act.

Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate). The Town will be issuing refunds, in the amount of the additional balance, to operators who have already provided payment for their 2020 license fee.

On June 4, 2020, the Provincial Government revised Ontario Regulation 82/20 to remove the limitations on the operation of Short Term Rentals. Consequently, all Short Term Rentals are now permitted to operate in a similar manner as to hotels and motels, subject to compliance with all other Regulations and/or industry guidelines (e.g. physical distancing). Thank you to all operators who complied with the Provincial Emergency Orders and Council resolution. We are thankful that you willingly set aside your personal interests in order to assist in the protection of public generally, and our residents specifically. For all operators who wish to operate in 2020 and have yet to pay their annual license fee, payment is required by Tuesday, June 30th. At this time payments may be provided by cheque in the drop off box located at the Municipal Office (1593 Four Mile Creek Road, Virgil), by mail, or through online banking. Please make cheques out to The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake and ensure envelopes are addressed to: Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, 1593 Four Mile Creek Road, PO Box 100, Virgil ON L0S 1T0 For all operators who are in the process of renewing their 2020 license and require inspections, please contact Marilena Basilone via email (Marilena.Basilone@notl.com), or by phone (905-468-3266) to book.

If you have recently cancelled or renewed your insurance, a new Certificate of Insurance must be submitted prior to operation. All operators must ensure their services meet physical distancing requirements and all other Provincial Emergency Orders, and Public Health guidelines in effect.

The Ontario Provincial Government issued Ontario Regulation 82/20 entitled Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. A revised list of essential services has been produced since our last communication to operators. The list includes the following: Specific to short term rentals, the Regulation states: 3. (1) Every person who provides short term rentals in rental accommodations shall ensure that any rentals booked after April 4, 2020 are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing during the emergency period.

A copy of the Order may be viewed online at, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/200082 Schedule 2 to the Regulation identifies seventy-four (74) essential businesses, including: 12. Hotels, motels, shared rental units and similar facilities, including student residences Please be advised that the Town does not consider Short Term Rental accommodations to fall within the scope of this essential business; consequently, the Town requires that you cease operations immediately. If compliance with this direction is not achieved by Monday, April 6, 2020, Council will consider further action. To this end, please be advised that on Friday, March 27, 2020, the Honourable Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing empowered local by-law enforcement officers to enforce Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act Orders under the Provincial Offences Act. Offences and set fines available to enforcement personnel include: Fail to comply with an emergency order $750.00 Obstruct any person exercising a power in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 Obstruct any person performing a duty in accordance with an Order made during a declared emergency $1,000.00 If you’re aware of a Short Term Rental (also known as a Bed & Breakfast, Air B&B, Country Inn, Cottage Rental, and Vacation Apartment) operating in contravention of the above requirement, please advise Niagara-on-the-Lake’s By-law Enforcement immediately. Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate). The Town will be issuing refunds, in the amount of the additional balance, to operators who have already provided payment for their 2020 license fee. Cheques will be sent by mail as soon as they are processed. Operators who have yet to provide payment for the 2020 licensing year may do so upon revocation of Ontario Regulation 82/20, Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. The application fee will be $115.00/room (2019 rate). Operators wishing to cancel their 2020 license and receive a refund may do so by providing a notice in writing stating that they have not yet operated in this calendar year. Applicants must request a refund no later than June 1, 2020. Please note that at this time, all Short Term Rental inspections have been cancelled. If you are impacted by this change, please be advised that Town staff will be in contact with you in the near future to reschedule your inspection. While we understand that discontinuing the operation of your Short Term Rental may cause additional financial strain during an already difficult time, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks for doing your part to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Niagara-on-the-Lake. We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter.

Enforcement can be reached via email (covidcomplaints@notl.com), phone (905-468-3266), or online complaint form. Refunds & Fees The Council of The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, at their Council Meeting, held March 30, 2020, approved the following motion: ""That staff be directed to reduce the licensing fees for all short-term rentals to the 2019 rates, and further that staff be directed to refund the excess funds paid for the year 2020 to operators who have provided payment"". Therefore, as per Council’s approved motion, the 2020 annual license fee for all short-term rental accommodations has been reduced to $115.00/room (2019 rate). The Town will be issuing refunds, in the amount of the additional balance, to operators who have already provided payment for their 2020 license fee. Cheques will be sent by mail as soon as they are processed. Operators who have yet to provide payment for the 2020 licensing year may do so upon revocation of Ontario Regulation 82/20, Closure of Places of Non-Essential Businesses. The application fee will be $115.00/room (2019 rate). Operators wishing to cancel their 2020 license and receive a refund may do so by providing a notice in writing stating that they have not yet operated in this calendar year. Applicants must request a refund no later than June 1, 2020. Please note that at this time, all Short Term Rental inspections have been cancelled. If you are impacted by this change, please be advised that Town staff will be in contact with you in the near future to reschedule your inspection. While we understand that discontinuing the operation of your Short Term Rental may cause additional financial strain during an already difficult time, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks for doing your part to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Niagara-on-the-Lake. We all have to do our part. Please, whenever possible, stay home. We thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation with this matter.

We are thankful that you willingly set aside your personal interests in order to assist in the protection of public generally, and our residents specifically.

At this time payments may be provided by cheque in the drop off box located at the Municipal Office (1593 Four Mile Creek Road, Virgil), by mail, or through online banking.

Please do not bring stuffed animals, toys, or electronics. Q: Are lunches and snacks provided? A: Lunches and snacks are not provided. Campers are required to bring their own healthy lunches and snacks. We are very active throughout the day and it is important that campers are well-nourished. Please note that we are a nut-free camp. Q: Is there a Before and After Care program? A: There is a Before and After Care program in place for campers whose parents/guardians need to drop them off early or pick them up late. The cost is $5.00/day. Before Care runs from 7:00-8:45 am and After Care runs from 4:15-6:00 pm. Q: Do campers have to physical distance from one another? A: Campers do have to practice physical distancing between cohorts (no cohort is able to interact with each other), however within their cohort they are able to interact with physical distancing in mind (some games have been changed to reflect this). Camp Staff sanitize all objects often and require campers to wash their hands frequently.

Cancellations will be accepted with a 10% administration charge. If the Town has to cancel camp for any reason, (i.e. due to weather) a full refund will be issued. Camp FAQs: COVID Update: There will be changes to how we operate camp and more details to follow. Q: What should my camper bring to camp? A: Please send your campers to camp with the following items: Refillable water bottle, running shoes, two snacks, and lunch. Please label all items being brought to camp. Please do not bring stuffed animals, toys, or electronics. Q: Are lunches and snacks provided? A: Lunches and snacks are not provided. Campers are required to bring their own healthy lunches and snacks. We are very active throughout the day and it is important that campers are well-nourished. Please note that we are a nut-free camp. Q: Is there a Before and After Care program? A: There is a Before and After Care program in place for campers whose parents/guardians need to drop them off early or pick them up late. The cost is $5.00/day. Before Care runs from 7:00-8:45 am and After Care runs from 4:15-6:00 pm. Q: Do campers have to physical distance from one another? A: Campers do have to practice physical distancing between cohorts (no cohort is able to interact with each other), however within their cohort they are able to interact with physical distancing in mind (some games have been changed to reflect this). Camp Staff sanitize all objects often and require campers to wash their hands frequently.

On June 4, 2020, the Provincial Government revised Ontario Regulation 82/20 to remove the limitations on the operation of Short Term Rentals. Consequently, all Short Term Rentals are now permitted to operate in a similar manner as to hotels and motels, subject to compliance with all other Regulations and/or industry guidelines (e.g. physical distancing). Thank you to all operators who complied with the Provincial Emergency Orders and Council resolution. We are thankful that you willingly set aside your personal interests in order to assist in the protection of public generally, and our residents specifically. For all operators who wish to operate in 2020 and have yet to pay their annual license fee, payment is required by Tuesday, June 30th. At this time payments may be provided by cheque in the drop off box located at the Municipal Office (1593 Four Mile Creek Road, Virgil), by mail, or through online banking. Please make cheques out to The Corporation of the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake and ensure envelopes are addressed to: Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, 1593 Four Mile Creek Road, PO Box 100, Virgil ON L0S 1T0 For all operators who are in the process of renewing their 2020 license and require inspections, please contact Marilena Basilone via email (Marilena.Basilone@notl.com), or by phone (905-468-3266) to book. We ask for your continued patience as there may be a longer then normal wait time to book inspections or to receive your license. If you have recently cancelled or renewed your insurance, a new Certificate of Insurance must be submitted prior to operation. All operators must ensure their services meet physical distancing requirements and all other Provincial Emergency Orders, and Public Health guidelines in effect. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19 related measures being taken by Niagara-on-the-Lake, please visit notl.com/COVID-19, or call 905-468-3266. Town Staff will continue to assist and serve citizens online and over the phone between the hours of 8:30 AM and 4:30 PM Monday to Friday. For immediate alerts, follow the Town on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

On June 4, 2020, the Provincial Government revised Ontario Regulation 82/20 to remove the limitations on the operation of Short Term Rentals. Consequently, all Short Term Rentals are now permitted to operate in a similar manner as to hotels and motels, subject to compliance with all other Regulations and/or industry guidelines (e.g. physical distancing). Thank you to all operators who complied with the Provincial Emergency Orders and Council resolution. We are thankful that you willingly set aside your personal interests in order to assist in the protection of public generally, and our residents specifically. For all operators who wish to operate in 2020 and have yet to pay their annual license fee, payment is required by Tuesday, June 30th. At this time payments may be provided by cheque in the drop off box located at the Municipal Office (1593 Four Mile Creek Road, Virgil), by mail, or through online banking.
