Watching ""made for kids"" content To comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other laws, certain features may be restricted or turned off on content that’s set as made for kids. Features impacted by COPPA: Made for Kids content At the video level, these features include: Autoplay on home Cards or end screens Channel branding watermark Channel Memberships Comments Donate button Likes and dislikes on YouTube Music Live chat or live chat donations Merchandise and ticketing Notifications Personalized advertising Playback in the Miniplayer Super Chat or Super Stickers Save to playlist and Save to watch later At the channel level, these features include: Channel Memberships Notifications Posts Stories What is “made for kids” content? Per our announcement in September 2019, we’ve made some changes to better protect kids and their privacy, and to address concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If their content is child-directed, creators are required to set their video or channel’s audience as “made for kids.” According to the FTC’s guidance on the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a video is made for kids if: Children are the primary audience. Children are not the primary audience, but the video is still directed to children based on factors such as the subject matter of the video, whether the video has an emphasis on kids characters, themes, toys or games, and more. For more information on these changes, check out this blog post. Was this helpful? How can we improve it?

Create a Community post Community posts can give you more reach on YouTube and greater engagement with your audience. Learn more about Community tab benefits and eligibility. Note: Community posts are disabled if a channel’s audience is set as made for kids. Learn more about setting your audience. Create a post Follow these steps to create a Community post. Sign in to YouTube. At the top of the page, select Upload Create post. In the box at the top: Type a message to create a text post or add text to an image, GIF, or video post. Choose to create a video , poll , or image post. Select Post. Mention other channels in a post You can mention other YouTube channels in your Community posts on a computer by entering @ followed immediately by the channel name. The channel may get a notification that you’ve mentioned them. Viewers can click on the mention from any device and go directly to that channel page. Understand types of posts Text posts To create a text post, enter your message in the text box on the Community tab of your channel. You can post your text by itself, or with a video, image, or GIF. Text posts can’t be combined with polls. Playlist posts If you have Community posts enabled, you can post playlists from artists that you enjoy. Open the playlist you’d like to share and copy the URL. Paste the playlist URL in the text field when creating your Community post. Image and GIF posts If you choose to upload an image with your post, you’ll be asked to select an image or animated GIF from your computer. Guidelines Size: Up to 16MB File types: JPG, PNG, GIF, or WEBP Suggested aspect ratio: We suggest 1:1 ratio because that's how images are shown in the feed. Viewers can see the full image by clicking to expand it. Keep in mind that all images must follow YouTube Community Guidelines. Video posts If you choose to add a video to your post, you can either: Search for a YouTube video Paste in a YouTube video URL Select a video from your YouTube channel When you create a post that shares a video by another creator, a notification may be sent to the original uploader of the video. This notification helps creators acknowledge when other creators are sharing their videos. Note: Community posts about a video already in a viewer’s Subscription or Home feed might not show again. This prevents your viewers from seeing the same video repeatedly. Polls If you choose to add a poll to your post, you’ll be asked to: Enter a question in the text field. Enter answers in the ""Add option"" fields. If you need more answer fields, click +Add another option and enter the questions and answers. Note: Poll options can be 65 characters max. Manage your activity You can see and manage a history of your activity on Community posts. This feature is only available on desktop. Note: A history of posts you’ve opened is only kept for 30 days. Go to YouTube.com. From the left, click History. From the right under ""History type,"" click Community. You’ll see your Community post history.

Creative Commons Creative Commons licenses provide a standard way for content creators to grant someone else permission to use their work. YouTube allows creators to mark their videos with a Creative Commons CC BY license. If you've marked your video with a CC BY license, you retain your copyright and other creators get to reuse your work subject to the terms of the license. Creative Commons on YouTube The ability to mark uploaded videos with a Creative Commons license is available to all creators. The standard YouTube license remains the default setting for all uploads. To review the terms of the standard YouTube license, please refer to our Terms of Service. Because Creative Commons licenses are for your original content, you cannot mark your video with the Creative Commons license if there's a Content ID claim on it. By marking your original video with a Creative Commons license, you're granting the entire YouTube community the right to reuse and edit that video. What's eligible for a Creative Commons license Note that you can only mark your uploaded video with a Creative Commons license if it's all content that you can license under the CC BY license.

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

Per our announcement in September 2019, we’ve made some changes to better protect kids and their privacy, and to address concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If their content is child-directed, creators are required to set their video or channel’s audience as “made for kids.” According to the FTC’s guidance on the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a video is made for kids if: Children are the primary audience. Children are not the primary audience, but the video is still directed to children based on factors such as the subject matter of the video, whether the video has an emphasis on kids characters, themes, toys or games, and more. For more information on these changes, check out this blog post. Was this helpful? How can we improve it?

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs.

Watching ""made for kids"" content To comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other laws, certain features may be restricted or turned off on content that’s set as made for kids.

Per our announcement in September 2019, we’ve made some changes to better protect kids and their privacy, and to address concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If their content is child-directed, creators are required to set their video or channel’s audience as “made for kids.” According to the FTC’s guidance on the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a video is made for kids if: Children are the primary audience. Children are not the primary audience, but the video is still directed to children based on factors such as the subject matter of the video, whether the video has an emphasis on kids characters, themes, toys or games, and more. For more information on these changes, check out this blog post. Was this helpful? How can we improve it?

Watching ""made for kids"" content To comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other laws, certain features may be restricted or turned off on content that’s set as made for kids.

Per our announcement in September 2019, we’ve made some changes to better protect kids and their privacy, and to address concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If their content is child-directed, creators are required to set their video or channel’s audience as “made for kids.” According to the FTC’s guidance on the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a video is made for kids if: Children are the primary audience. Children are not the primary audience, but the video is still directed to children based on factors such as the subject matter of the video, whether the video has an emphasis on kids characters, themes, toys or games, and more. For more information on these changes, check out this blog post. Was this helpful? How can we improve it?

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs.

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

Note: Community posts are disabled if a channel’s audience is set as made for kids. Learn more about setting your audience. Create a post Follow these steps to create a Community post. Sign in to YouTube. At the top of the page, select Upload Create post. In the box at the top: Type a message to create a text post or add text to an image, GIF, or video post. Choose to create a video , poll , or image post. Select Post. Mention other channels in a post You can mention other YouTube channels in your Community posts on a computer by entering @ followed immediately by the channel name. The channel may get a notification that you’ve mentioned them. Viewers can click on the mention from any device and go directly to that channel page. Understand types of posts Text posts To create a text post, enter your message in the text box on the Community tab of your channel. You can post your text by itself, or with a video, image, or GIF. Text posts can’t be combined with polls. Playlist posts If you have Community posts enabled, you can post playlists from artists that you enjoy. Open the playlist you’d like to share and copy the URL. Paste the playlist URL in the text field when creating your Community post. Image and GIF posts If you choose to upload an image with your post, you’ll be asked to select an image or animated GIF from your computer. Guidelines Size: Up to 16MB File types: JPG, PNG, GIF, or WEBP Suggested aspect ratio: We suggest 1:1 ratio because that's how images are shown in the feed.

Video posts If you choose to add a video to your post, you can either: Search for a YouTube video Paste in a YouTube video URL Select a video from your YouTube channel When you create a post that shares a video by another creator, a notification may be sent to the original uploader of the video. This notification helps creators acknowledge when other creators are sharing their videos. Note: Community posts about a video already in a viewer’s Subscription or Home feed might not show again. This prevents your viewers from seeing the same video repeatedly. Polls If you choose to add a poll to your post, you’ll be asked to: Enter a question in the text field. Enter answers in the ""Add option"" fields. If you need more answer fields, click +Add another option and enter the questions and answers. Note: Poll options can be 65 characters max.

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality.

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

Create a Community post Community posts can give you more reach on YouTube and greater engagement with your audience. Learn more about Community tab benefits and eligibility. Note: Community posts are disabled if a channel’s audience is set as made for kids. Learn more about setting your audience. Create a post Follow these steps to create a Community post. Sign in to YouTube. At the top of the page, select Upload Create post. In the box at the top: Type a message to create a text post or add text to an image, GIF, or video post. Choose to create a video , poll , or image post. Select Post. Mention other channels in a post You can mention other YouTube channels in your Community posts on a computer by entering @ followed immediately by the channel name. The channel may get a notification that you’ve mentioned them. Viewers can click on the mention from any device and go directly to that channel page. Understand types of posts Text posts To create a text post, enter your message in the text box on the Community tab of your channel. You can post your text by itself, or with a video, image, or GIF. Text posts can’t be combined with polls. Playlist posts If you have Community posts enabled, you can post playlists from artists that you enjoy. Open the playlist you’d like to share and copy the URL. Paste the playlist URL in the text field when creating your Community post. Image and GIF posts If you choose to upload an image with your post, you’ll be asked to select an image or animated GIF from your computer. Guidelines Size: Up to 16MB File types: JPG, PNG, GIF, or WEBP Suggested aspect ratio: We suggest 1:1 ratio because that's how images are shown in the feed. Viewers can see the full image by clicking to expand it. Keep in mind that all images must follow YouTube Community Guidelines. Video posts If you choose to add a video to your post, you can either: Search for a YouTube video Paste in a YouTube video URL Select a video from your YouTube channel When you create a post that shares a video by another creator, a notification may be sent to the original uploader of the video. This notification helps creators acknowledge when other creators are sharing their videos. Note: Community posts about a video already in a viewer’s Subscription or Home feed might not show again. This prevents your viewers from seeing the same video repeatedly. Polls If you choose to add a poll to your post, you’ll be asked to: Enter a question in the text field. Enter answers in the ""Add option"" fields. If you need more answer fields, click +Add another option and enter the questions and answers. Note: Poll options can be 65 characters max.

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs.

Music in this video The description of a video that contains music may include information about the song(s) in the video. YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

Sign in to YouTube. At the top of the page, select Upload Create post. In the box at the top: Type a message to create a text post or add text to an image, GIF, or video post. Choose to create a video , poll , or image post. Select Post. Mention other channels in a post You can mention other YouTube channels in your Community posts on a computer by entering @ followed immediately by the channel name. The channel may get a notification that you’ve mentioned them. Viewers can click on the mention from any device and go directly to that channel page. Understand types of posts Text posts To create a text post, enter your message in the text box on the Community tab of your channel. You can post your text by itself, or with a video, image, or GIF.

YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality. We are continually working in conjunction with our music industry partners to add more data and improve the information we have. You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process. Make sure you and your songs are registered with the ISNI Authority, which will help us confirm we have the best data to represent you and your music. In addition, you might want to reach out to your label, publisher and/or collection society to make sure they provide YouTube with complete and accurate information, including identifiers like ISRCs, ISWCs, UPCs, and ISNIs. This kind of data is critical to improvements to this feature in the future. Was this helpful? How can we improve it? YesNo Submit true Copyright and rights management What is copyright?

YouTube adds this information automatically to some videos when the video has been identified and “claimed” by music rightsholders via YouTube’s rights management tools, including Content ID. These notes usually link to a music video or other official content for each song, to help you discover songs and artists you haven’t heard before. Why some videos include song information in video descriptions What does “Licensed to YouTube by” mean? The entities listed in the “Licensed to YouTube by” field are the music rightsholders who have agreed with YouTube to allow YouTube to use identified music in official and user-generated videos, and share in the revenue those videos earn on the platform. For example, if you see an ad on a video that contains music and has “Music in this video” information, the labels and publishers listed under “Licensed to YouTube by” are earning a share of the revenue generated by that ad. Users remain bound by YouTube’s Terms of Service. Sometimes there may be a large number of entities sharing in the revenue for a single song. In addition to music labels and publishers whose names you may recognize, you may see that some songs are “Licensed to YouTube by” a number of “music rights societies.” This refers to organizations that collect royalties on behalf of their songwriter and publisher members around the world. Just like with individual music publishers, YouTube has license agreements with these entities and shares revenue with them for videos they claim. Learn more. Why is some information missing from “Music in this video?” We only place music information on the video watch page when we are confident we have data that is accurate and of high quality.

You may also notice that—for videos that contain many songs—only information about the first ten will appear. What if I hear my song in a video, but don’t see “Music in this video” information? There are a variety of reasons “Music in this video” may not appear, including cases where the music has not yet been identified, we have not received sufficient data from label or publishing partners to display useful information, or when the video has only recently been claimed. If you work with a record label, music publisher and/or collection society who distributes content and/or uses Content ID on your behalf, you may wish to contact them for more detail. What if my song is listed, but the data is wrong? If you are a recording artist and/or songwriter, and you see your song has been identified with incorrect or incomplete information, there are a few steps you can take: Send us feedback using our feedback form to help us improve this feature and our data quality process.
