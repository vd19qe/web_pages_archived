Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced in a March 18 release that the company was ceasing production at all its North American plants due to the COVID-19 pandemic until the end of the month. Vito Beato, first vice-president of Unifor Local 1285, which represents thousands of workers at the Brampton plant, confirmed that the facility had suspended production effective March 18 because of the virus. According to a FCA fact sheet, there are 3,202 hourly employees at the facility. Beato said plants that supply parts to the Chrysler facility have also shut down due to the virus, so the number of workers affected by the shutdown is higher. He said union members will have access to employment insurance (EI) and additional benefits while the plants are closed. “We're working with the companies and the government, of course, to look at getting everybody topped up,” he said. “So we're looking to make sure that everyone makes as close to 100 per cent of their wages as possible.” In the March 18 release, FCA said they worked with the autoworkers’ union to come to the decision to cease production at their North American plants through to the end of March. The company said that while production is paused, it will work with the union to implement changes to “shift timings, structures and enhanced cleaning protocols.” In the release, FCA CEO Mike Manley said that “we need to ensure employees feel safe at work and that we are taking every step possible to protect them.” “We will continue to do what is right for our people through this period of uncertainty,” he said. Automakers Ford, General Motors (GM) and Honda have all also announced suspension of production at their North American facilities due to coronavirus concerns.
