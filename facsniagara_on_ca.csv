With the current outbreak of COVID-19, we continue to follow recommendations from public health officials, which includes physical infection prevention through social distancing practices.

Our St. Catharines site will remain operational, however, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, a number of recommendations have been implemented. Where feasible, we will be limiting access to the St. Catharines office to essential persons, as well as asking those who attend the office a series of screening questions and asking them to sanitize their hands. We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead. Many of our staff will be working remotely during this time and will be accessible via phone or e-mail regarding child protection services. We have also undertaken several initiatives to ensure continuing safety of all persons, including, but not limited to social distancing practices for any on-site work.

With the current outbreak of COVID-19, we continue to follow recommendations from public health officials, which includes physical infection prevention through social distancing practices. In order to reduce person-to-person contact, we have temporarily suspended on-site operations in our two branch offices in Welland and Niagara Falls until further notice. Our St. Catharines site will remain operational, however, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, a number of recommendations have been implemented. Where feasible, we will be limiting access to the St. Catharines office to essential persons, as well as asking those who attend the office a series of screening questions and asking them to sanitize their hands. We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead. Many of our staff will be working remotely during this time and will be accessible via phone or e-mail regarding child protection services. We have also undertaken several initiatives to ensure continuing safety of all persons, including, but not limited to social distancing practices for any on-site work. Events and conferences and non-essential meetings planned during this time period have also been postponed. We want to assure the community, and our children and families that we are continuing to provide protection services to the Niagara community.

We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead.

With the current outbreak of COVID-19, we continue to follow recommendations from public health officials, which includes physical infection prevention through social distancing practices. In order to reduce person-to-person contact, we have temporarily suspended on-site operations in our two branch offices in Welland and Niagara Falls until further notice. Our St. Catharines site will remain operational, however, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, a number of recommendations have been implemented. Where feasible, we will be limiting access to the St. Catharines office to essential persons, as well as asking those who attend the office a series of screening questions and asking them to sanitize their hands. We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead. Many of our staff will be working remotely during this time and will be accessible via phone or e-mail regarding child protection services. We have also undertaken several initiatives to ensure continuing safety of all persons, including, but not limited to social distancing practices for any on-site work. Events and conferences and non-essential meetings planned during this time period have also been postponed. We want to assure the community, and our children and families that we are continuing to provide protection services to the Niagara community.

With the current outbreak of COVID-19, we continue to follow recommendations from public health officials, which includes physical infection prevention through social distancing practices. In order to reduce person-to-person contact, we have temporarily suspended on-site operations in our two branch offices in Welland and Niagara Falls until further notice. Our St. Catharines site will remain operational, however, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, a number of recommendations have been implemented. Where feasible, we will be limiting access to the St. Catharines office to essential persons, as well as asking those who attend the office a series of screening questions and asking them to sanitize their hands. We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead. Many of our staff will be working remotely during this time and will be accessible via phone or e-mail regarding child protection services. We have also undertaken several initiatives to ensure continuing safety of all persons, including, but not limited to social distancing practices for any on-site work.

We want to assure the community, and our children and families that we are continuing to provide protection services to the Niagara community.

We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead.

We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead.

Where feasible, we will be limiting access to the St. Catharines office to essential persons, as well as asking those who attend the office a series of screening questions and asking them to sanitize their hands. We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead. Many of our staff will be working remotely during this time and will be accessible via phone or e-mail regarding child protection services. We have also undertaken several initiatives to ensure continuing safety of all persons, including, but not limited to social distancing practices for any on-site work.

We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead.

With the current outbreak of COVID-19, we continue to follow recommendations from public health officials, which includes physical infection prevention through social distancing practices. In order to reduce person-to-person contact, we have temporarily suspended on-site operations in our two branch offices in Welland and Niagara Falls until further notice. Our St. Catharines site will remain operational, however, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, a number of recommendations have been implemented. Where feasible, we will be limiting access to the St. Catharines office to essential persons, as well as asking those who attend the office a series of screening questions and asking them to sanitize their hands. We would ask that anyone who plans to attend the St. Catharines office to please call ahead. Many of our staff will be working remotely during this time and will be accessible via phone or e-mail regarding child protection services. We have also undertaken several initiatives to ensure continuing safety of all persons, including, but not limited to social distancing practices for any on-site work. Events and conferences and non-essential meetings planned during this time period have also been postponed. We want to assure the community, and our children and families that we are continuing to provide protection services to the Niagara community.
