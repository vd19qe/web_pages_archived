The state of emergency comes due to the growing cases of the novel coronavirus, and Ford’s announcement is forcing restaurants and bars to close. Ford made his statement the morning of March 17, and the following information is up-to-date with winery statements as of print time. Andrew Peller Limited — owners of Peller Estates, Trius Winery & Restaurant, Wayne Gretzky Estates Winery and Thirty Bench in Beamsville — announced all restaurants would be closing immediately. Wines, however, will continue to be available in the retail store as well as at The Wine Shop locations throughout Ontario. “We recognize that this may cause some inconvenience to our winery visitors, but it is with the health and safety of our guests, staff and community in mind that these decisions have been made,” said Tim Coons, regional estate manager with Andrew Peller Limited. Peller Estate will also cancel its 2020 Party in the Vineyard: Food Truck Edition event, which has been hosted over the May long weekend for the last eight years. The plan is to keep any June and summer events on the calendar as scheduled, but ticket release dates for those events will be postponed. Konzelmann Estate Winery has also decided it will suspend its tours and tasting, effective immediately. They do intend to continue operations as a retail outlet, but will only be accepting card payments; no cash. Online orders for delivery can also be made. Arterra Wines Canada — owners of Jackson-Triggs, Inniskillin and other brands — also cancelled its wine tours, tasting and events but remain open as a retail store; however, it will only be open for curbside pick up. Orders can be placed by call or online, and pick up location can be decided at checkout. Online orders for shipping are also available. Reif Estate Winery is limiting its winery to 15 guests to allow for social distancing, while also cancelling wine tours, tastings and events. Only the wine shop will remain open, and will only accept debit or credit card, while also taking online orders for shipping. Two Sisters Vineyard, according to their website, is closed until April 6. For wineries not mentioned in this article, it’s important to call ahead.

Sandy Jaskula, who co-owns Teddy's Food Fun and Spirits in Grimsby, said prices were discouraging after looking into the cost of some of the equipment she needed to reopen her restaurant for takeout orders. She said some suppliers are charging $20 to $25 for a face shield, and she might need dozens of them before the crisis is over. ""The big companies just want to gouge you."" Grimsby Downtown Improvement Area president Mike Williscraft said the majority of businesses in his community are ""single-person or mom and pop shops,"" with three or less employees. For many of them, he said, ""every dime needs to be accounted for."" There are, however, some suppliers that sincerely want to help. Williscraft said he was recently contacted by Woodworkers Unite, a collaboration of several Ontario woodworking companies that began using their expertise and equipment to create plastic face shields, as the shortage of personal protective equipment became apparent. The organization — it sells the face shields it manufactures online for $8.95 each — offered to donate them to a limited number of businesses in the area. Williscraft, however, saw an opportunity to leverage the organization's generosity to help even more businesses get back on their feet. The Downtown Improvement Area teamed up Woodworkers Unite as well as the Town of Grimsby to make hundreds of face shields available to local businesses — for free. ""I can't state enough how much the businesses appreciated it,"" said Williscraft, who runs an independent newspaper serving west Niagara. In addition to cutting its price for the face shields to $6 each, Woodworkers Unite donated one-third of the overall cost allow the town and Downtown Improvement Area to distribute 800 face shields to businesses throughout Grimsby. ""This project was just a very simple straight forward step that couldn't do anything but good for everyone,"" Williscraft said. Grimsby Mayor Jeff Jordan called it an effective solution for businesses facing challenges reopening. The clear face shields do not obscure faces, allowing for a more personal interaction, he added. ""With a mask, unfortunately, you can't tell people's reactions and you never see them smile,"" Jordan said. ""We brought the smile back into town, so to speak."" Although the businesses received two face shields each, Williscraft said they can purchase more if they need them at the discounted rate. Williscraft said he hopes to expand the initiative to businesses in neighbouring communities. While helping protect the community from the potentially deadly COVID-19, Williscraft said the masks also give customers the confidence they need to return to local businesses. ""People are going to need and want to feel comfortable to come back to any downtown,"" he said. ""The workers need to feel comfortable serving those people."" Thanks to protection provided by the masks, Jaskula said the first weekend after reopening was ""insane"" for her 56-year-old business. ""People were missing us,"" she said, adding 7,000 chicken wings have been sold since last Thursday. Now, despite only opening for takeout orders from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursday to Saturday, she's struggling to ensure she has enough staff to fill orders. ""We were exhausted,"" she said. ""We're crazy busy."" The face shields can also be purchased at woodworkersunite.com/products/face-shield.

It will not disappear’ Grimsby Downtown Improvement Area president Mike Williscraft said the majority of businesses in his community are ""single-person or mom and pop shops,"" with three or less employees. For many of them, he said, ""every dime needs to be accounted for."" There are, however, some suppliers that sincerely want to help. Williscraft said he was recently contacted by Woodworkers Unite, a collaboration of several Ontario woodworking companies that began using their expertise and equipment to create plastic face shields, as the shortage of personal protective equipment became apparent. The organization — it sells the face shields it manufactures online for $8.95 each — offered to donate them to a limited number of businesses in the area. Williscraft, however, saw an opportunity to leverage the organization's generosity to help even more businesses get back on their feet. The Downtown Improvement Area teamed up Woodworkers Unite as well as the Town of Grimsby to make hundreds of face shields available to local businesses — for free. ""I can't state enough how much the businesses appreciated it,"" said Williscraft, who runs an independent newspaper serving west Niagara. In addition to cutting its price for the face shields to $6 each, Woodworkers Unite donated one-third of the overall cost allow the town and Downtown Improvement Area to distribute 800 face shields to businesses throughout Grimsby. ""This project was just a very simple straight forward step that couldn't do anything but good for everyone,"" Williscraft said. Grimsby Mayor Jeff Jordan called it an effective solution for businesses facing challenges reopening. The clear face shields do not obscure faces, allowing for a more personal interaction, he added. ""With a mask, unfortunately, you can't tell people's reactions and you never see them smile,"" Jordan said. ""We brought the smile back into town, so to speak."" Although the businesses received two face shields each, Williscraft said they can purchase more if they need them at the discounted rate. Williscraft said he hopes to expand the initiative to businesses in neighbouring communities. While helping protect the community from the potentially deadly COVID-19, Williscraft said the masks also give customers the confidence they need to return to local businesses. ""People are going to need and want to feel comfortable to come back to any downtown,"" he said. ""The workers need to feel comfortable serving those people."" Thanks to protection provided by the masks, Jaskula said the first weekend after reopening was ""insane"" for her 56-year-old business.

Sandy Jaskula, who co-owns Teddy's Food Fun and Spirits in Grimsby, said prices were discouraging after looking into the cost of some of the equipment she needed to reopen her restaurant for takeout orders. She said some suppliers are charging $20 to $25 for a face shield, and she might need dozens of them before the crisis is over. ""The big companies just want to gouge you.""
