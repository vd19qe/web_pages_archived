As we prepare to conclude the winter term while navigating through the extraordinary challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize that many of our students are nearing the end of their academic journey. Marking this significant milestone for our graduates and their families is important to us – it’s the highlight of our academic year – however, the health and safety of our College community remains paramount, and we continue to be guided by measures and government directives related to COVID-19. Due to the importance of physical distancing and our continued campus closure, Niagara College will not proceed with plans to host Spring Convocation Ceremonies on campus, as scheduled, in June. While our traditional, in-person ceremonies have been cancelled, we are currently exploring alternative opportunities to acknowledge the achievements of our 2020 graduates in a meaningful way. Further details will be provided in the weeks ahead. Those who have fulfilled their academic requirements can also rest assured that they will receive their credentials over the course of the spring term. Please watch the Niagara College website and your student email for further information. ...

In early June, we announced a plan for the Fall 2020 term that balances health and safety with academic quality and student success, with fully online delivery in some programs, and a mix of online and limited on-campus learning in programs that cannot be fully completed remotely. Recently, the Ontario government released a comprehensive framework for on-campus activities this summer for students in essential programs who need to complete practical, in-person course work in order to graduate. While campus access is expected to be very limited through the summer and in September, essential employees and those who are preparing for and delivering academic programs that cannot be completed remotely will be permitted on campus – pending required approval and health screenings prior to arrival. Our management team will continue to exercise discretion and provide approvals for other activity that may be required on campus from time to time. Employees who are not required on campus will continue to work remotely, and the College will continue to provide services to help students adapt and succeed in an online and alternate delivery environment. When on-campus attendance is required, a number of precautions must be taken. We are working closely with internal stakeholders and public health to finalize the measures that will be in place as these on-campus activities resume – in line with the government’s framework. All of us – students, employees and visitors – share a responsibility in creating a safe learning environment and workplace, from following guidelines for hand hygiene and physical distancing, to not putting others at risk if we are experiencing symptoms. While some logistics and protocols are still being finalized, I wanted to share the key steps that Niagara College will take moving forward. Please read more about these steps here ⬇️ ...
