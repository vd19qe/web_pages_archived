FILE PHOTO: WestJet airline signage is pictured at Vancouver's international airport in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, February 5, 2019. REUTERS/Ben Nelms/File Photo The airline-led talks come as Air Canada and WestJet introduce their own testing plans for Toronto and Vancouver airports, respectively this fall. The use of airport testing to reduce or eliminate Canada’s strict two-week self quarantine rule would be logistically challenging as it would require cooperation from airports, airlines, federal and provincial health authorities, the sources said. And government-approved lab tests that largely take 24 to 48 hours to deliver results would need to be used, making them impractical for airport departures, they added. Canada has faced pressure from airlines to change its travel restrictions, with the country’s borders now closed to all noncitizens except for essential workers. “The airlines have a vested interest in seeing this happen,” one of the source said. “But there is no guarantee that Canada would choose to lift the 14-day quarantine even if testing were able to take place at airports.” Globally, carriers and airports largely back testing to replace quarantines, with a U.N. aviation task force expected to weigh in on one industry proposal at a Sept. 15 meeting, airline group IATA said. IATA and Airports Council International (ACI) support the use of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 48 hours ahead of departure from high-risk countries, since rapid tests are not seen as reliable or widely accepted by regulators. Health Canada has changed its position on home tests and is now willing to consider approving rapid home COVID-19 tests. Last week U.S. regulators approved a rapid test from Abbott Laboratories but it is currently approved only for people who have symptoms. WestJet and Vancouver International Airport have not yet finalized joint plans announced last week to test some departing passengers. Tamara Vrooman, chief executive of the Vancouver airport, said one possibility was for the facility to be certified as a lab, but “we’re still examining that.” Air Canada declined comment. Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said on Friday her agency was looking at “options going forward and reducing the more restrictive measures at the border.” Health officials are also considering the timing of the test, since travelers coming to Canada might have a negative result if they were infected only one or two days prior. Transport Canada said it is committed to “working with other federal partners to explore COVID testing at airports upon arrival.” Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Allison Martell in Toronto; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Tom Brown Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Slideshow ( 5 images ) The rise comes as schools across the country started to reopen after a nearly five-month forced shutdown to contain the spread of the virus, which has killed 9,153 people, according to latest government data. New cases jumped by 1,606 in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 133,748. “This week is a really critical week,” Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said. An average of 545 new cases had been reported daily over the past week, up from about 300 in July. “This is concerning ... when cases occur, including in schools, it is a reflection on what’s happening in the community,” Tam told a briefing. Canada’s western province of British Columbia has asked restaurants, pubs and bars to end sale of liquor at 10:00 p.m. and ordered bars and restaurants to close by 11:00 p.m., unless serving food, according to a government statement. Several of Canada’s 10 provinces started reopening schools this week for in-person learning after investing millions in added protections. Quebec, which welcomed back pupils last month, has already reported a number of cases in schools. Tam noted the increase in infections was concentrated among younger adults and cited the risk posed by private functions and family gatherings. Alberta, which reopened schools one week ago, reported 11 COVID-19 cases spread across 11 different schools, Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Deena Hinshaw said on Tuesday, adding the infections were spread in the community, and not acquired within the schools. Alberta now has 1,692 known active cases, the most since early May. The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most-populous province, railed against young people and students who he said were holding unauthorized parties and warned them he wanted the police to lay charges if necessary. “No more parties. I just can’t stress it enough,” Doug Ford told a briefing on Tuesday. Ontario is suspending by a month efforts to lift remaining restrictions in place to fight the outbreak. The coronavirus reproduction number, which shows how many people someone with COVID-19 is infecting, has risen to just above one, an indication that the virus is spreading. “That is not a good sign,” Tam said. Quebec unveiled a four-step alert system for measures to curb COVID-19 that would introduce restrictions such as limiting the number of people allowed to gather depending on the risk of transmission.

Each of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by declines in technology and energy. Reports on Friday that SoftBank made significant option purchases during the run-up in U.S. stocks added to investor nervousness. Technology once again dragged indexes lower with a drop of 4.59%, the third straight decline and worst three-day performance for the sector since mid-March. Even with the recent drop, the sector remains the best performer on the year. “Things got expensive, they ran up, they got very concentrated and people got really giddy,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “Everyone is all loaded up on one side, it doesn’t take much of a ripple to knock some apples off the cart.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 632.42 points, or 2.25%, to 27,500.89, the S&P 500 lost 95.12 points, or 2.78%, to 3,331.84 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 465.44 points, or 4.11%, to 10,847.69. Energy shares slumped 3.71% as oil prices fell below $40 a barrel. Media reports of SoftBank’s option purchases also reminded investors that market makers might have billions of dollars’ worth of long positions as hedges against options trades. Related Coverage U.S. options investors pull back on tech bets, but SoftBank's trade looms large Wall Street’s rally, which has been fueled in large part by massive amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus, screeched to a halt last week with the Nasdaq falling as much as 9.9% from its intraday record as investors booked profits after a run that lifted the index about 70% from its pandemic lows. Tuesday’s losses put the index down 10% from its closing record, confirming a correction began on Sept. 2. At session lows on Tuesday, Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Netflix had collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since Sept. 2. Tesla plunged 21.06% to suffer its biggest daily percentage drop as the electric-car maker was excluded from a group of companies being added to the S&P 500. Investors had widely expected its inclusion after a blockbuster quarterly earnings report in July. Up to Friday’s close, the stock had surged about 400% this year. JPMorgan Chase & Co fell 3.48%, after a report it was probing employees who were allegedly involved in the misuse of funds intended for COVID-19 relief. The wider banks index lost 3.44%, also tracking Treasury yields. A gauge of value stocks fell 1.84%, but outperformed the broader market and a 3.38%, decline in the growth index. Wall Street’s fear gauge climbed for the third time in four sessions. Concerns over potential U.S. sanctions against China’s biggest chipmaker, SMIC, hit domestic suppliers, with the PHLX semiconductor index down 3.43%.

Slideshow ( 2 images ) Imports fell 1.2%, while exports were down 1.0%. Canada’s trade deficit, meanwhile, narrowed slightly to C$2.45 billion ($1.85 billion), missing analyst expectations of C$2.0 billion. Statscan revised July’s trade deficit to C$2.53 billion from an initial C$2.45 billion. “The slowdown in trade showed up earlier than we had anticipated, and the drop in export volumes suggests that the recovery’s momentum could have slowed more than anticipated in August,” said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Economics, in a note. Lower imports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts drove the import decline, while exports fell after three months of strong gains on lower exports of passenger cars and light trucks, Statscan said. Imports from Canada’s largest trading partner, the United States, fell 1.6%, while exports to that country were up 1.0% on higher lumber exports. Exports to all countries remained 7% below pre-pandemic levels, while imports remained down 5.1%, Statscan said. “Overall, the fact that we haven’t fully recovered in the merchandise side is a disappointment,” said Ross Prusakowski, principal economist at Export Development Canada. Prusakowski noted that some of the export weakness was temporary, pointing to a strike at the Port of Montreal in August that had an impact on shipments, particularly to Europe. “That’s one area where we think there might be some strength coming back,” Prusakowski said. Analysts also noted that a July boost caused by shorter seasonal shutdowns at most auto assembly plants did not continue into August, returning trade in that segment to more typical levels. Still, export levels of passenger cars and light trucks were almost C$200 million higher than in February, Statscan said. The Canadian dollar CAD= was trading nearly unchanged after the data at 1.3260 to the greenback, or 75.41 U.S. cents.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch (CANADA - Tags: BUSINESS) TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar gained ground against its broadly weaker U.S. counterpart on Friday as signs of progress on developing a COVID-19 vaccine boosted investor sentiment, with the loonie clawing back some of this week’s decline. The Canadian dollar CAD= was trading 0.3% higher at 1.3180 to the greenback, or 75.87 U.S. cents, having traded in a range of 1.3177 to 1.3237. For the week, the loonie was down 0.5%. “The usual suspects” were behind the currency’s move higher on Friday, including a weaker U.S. dollar and increased risk appetite, said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics. Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major producer of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to the global flow of trade and capital. Wall Street bounced back after three straight days of losses as a positive update from Pfizer on development of its COVID-19 vaccine tempered worries that a resurgent pandemic would derail economic recovery. Data showing stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales growth last month added to positive sentiment. Canadian manufacturing sales fell by 2.0% in August, following three months of consecutive gains, Statistics Canada said. Excluding transportation equipment, sales rose 1.1%. U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 settled 0.2% lower at $40.88 a barrel on concern that a spike in COVID-19 cases in Europe and the United States would curtail demand in two of the world's biggest fuel consuming regions. Preserving Canada’s triple-A credit rating could be less of a priority for Ottawa than in years gone by, with the focus on digging the economy out of a hole rather than staying in a shrinking group of top-rated sovereign borrowers, analysts say. Canadian government bond yields were mixed across the curve, with the 10-year CA10YT=RR unchanged at 0.572%.

FILE PHOTO: A Canadian flag flies in front of the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, March 22, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo To maintain its top rating, Canada would likely need to convince credit rating agencies it has a tenable plan to restore fiscal health once the coronavirus pandemic recedes, say the analysts. Ottawa has projected a budget deficit of C$343 billion ($259 billion) for the current fiscal year ending March 31 as it spends to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, which at about 16% of GDP would be a record shortfall. Credit rating agencies will be closely watching Ottawa’s fiscal update expected in the fall to assess Canada’s financial health. But the threat of a downgrade may not shape policy as much as it did in the 1990s, when S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service stripped Canada of its triple-A rating. Back then, Canada entered into a multi-year period of fiscal austerity, spurred by the unflattering disparity between its finances and those of peers. Now, Canada is not an outlier. “The whole thing is relativity ... when you put it in the international context, Canada doesn’t look as bad as it might,” said John Manley, a senior business adviser at Bennett Jones and former federal finance minister and industry minister in Liberal Party governments. Globally, government spending to offset the economic impact of the virus totals $12 trillion, or about 12% of gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund, while the number of sovereign borrowers rated triple A has fallen to 10 to 12, depending on the rating agency, from as many as 19 a decade ago. ‘NO TIME FOR AUSTERITY’ S&P has said that Canada is better positioned than most countries to spend temporarily in support of its economy. It, Moody’s and DBRS Morningstar give Canada their highest rating. But Fitch Ratings downgraded the country’s rating in June. Canada’s borrowing costs have not suffered. With the Bank of Canada buying much of the government’s debt issuance, through its quantitative easing program, bond yields have held near record lows. That has emboldened Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to promise even more spending by his Liberal government, saying that “this is not the time for austerity.” Any government that runs a deficit the size of Canada’s “doesn’t care much about what the rating agencies have to say,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research. The fall fiscal update is likely to include some longer-term fiscal projections as well as the costing of economic support measures, economists say. “I think the focus will be more on helping the economy rather than tackling deficits,” said Josh Nye, a senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. “The severity of the second wave and its economic impact will be key in how much government support needs to remain in place.” Canada’s new COVID-19 cases in the second wave have risen above the peak in the spring, forcing provinces to take targeted measures. “Some rating agencies will look through to the medium term, citing this as a transitory event,” said Maria Berlettano, head of Canadian government credit strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. “Others may not be so patient.” ($1 = 1.3229 Canadian dollars) Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Peter Cooney Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch (CANADA - Tags: BUSINESS) TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar gained ground against its broadly weaker U.S. counterpart on Friday as signs of progress on developing a COVID-19 vaccine boosted investor sentiment, with the loonie clawing back some of this week’s decline. The Canadian dollar CAD= was trading 0.3% higher at 1.3180 to the greenback, or 75.87 U.S. cents, having traded in a range of 1.3177 to 1.3237. For the week, the loonie was down 0.5%. “The usual suspects” were behind the currency’s move higher on Friday, including a weaker U.S. dollar and increased risk appetite, said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics. Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major producer of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to the global flow of trade and capital. Wall Street bounced back after three straight days of losses as a positive update from Pfizer on development of its COVID-19 vaccine tempered worries that a resurgent pandemic would derail economic recovery. Data showing stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales growth last month added to positive sentiment. Canadian manufacturing sales fell by 2.0% in August, following three months of consecutive gains, Statistics Canada said. Excluding transportation equipment, sales rose 1.1%. U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 settled 0.2% lower at $40.88 a barrel on concern that a spike in COVID-19 cases in Europe and the United States would curtail demand in two of the world's biggest fuel consuming regions. Preserving Canada’s triple-A credit rating could be less of a priority for Ottawa than in years gone by, with the focus on digging the economy out of a hole rather than staying in a shrinking group of top-rated sovereign borrowers, analysts say. Canadian government bond yields were mixed across the curve, with the 10-year CA10YT=RR unchanged at 0.572%.

FILE PHOTO: Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends a news conference at Rideau Cottage, as efforts continue to help slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada November 20, 2020. REUTERS/Blair Gable Trudeau’s comments were a clear indication that the border restrictions will last well into 2021. The two neighbors agreed to the ban in March and have rolled it over on a monthly basis ever since. The ban does not affect trade. The two countries have highly integrated economies and Canada sends 75% of its goods exports to the United States every month. “Until the virus is significantly more under control everywhere around the world, we’re not going to be releasing the restrictions at the border,” Trudeau told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. when asked about the issue. “We are incredibly lucky that trade in essential goods, in agricultural products, in pharmaceuticals is flowing back and forth as it always has,” he said. Trudeau spoke the day after his minority Liberal government said the budget deficit would hit a historic C$381.6 billion ($294.7 billion) on COVID-19 aid and promised to spend an additional C$100 billion in stimulus. Trudeau, who relies on other parties to govern, would be toppled if the House of Commons votes against the measures but he dismissed that as unlikely. “I am reasonably confident none of the opposition parties wants an election right now,” he later told reporters. The border restrictions are opposed by the travel industry, hit by a slumping number of tourists. But the premiers of Canada’s major provinces say they have no interest in re-opening the border as long as cases of COVID-19 escalate in the United States. A second wave is also sweeping across Canada, where authorities are starting to re-impose restrictions on businesses and limit the size of gatherings.

FILE PHOTO: Workers guide equipment at a condominium development in Calgary, Alberta, Canada December 6, 2019. REUTERS/Todd Korol Canada’s Q3 annualized growth soared 40.5%, rebounding from a historic plunge in the second quarter, while September real GDP rose by 0.8%. Both the quarterly and monthly numbers missed analyst expectations. Despite the gains, total economic activity remains about 5% below February’s pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. “We already knew we had a rapid bounce back in economic activity in the third quarter,” said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC. “The concern now is how much of that can be sustained with the accelerating virus spread.” Canada is in the midst of a harsh second wave of COVID-19 infections and a number of provinces have already imposed new restrictions, and in some cases targeted lockdowns, in an effort to stem the spread. Related Coverage Instant View: Canada's third quarter annualized growth rises record 40.5% That will likely impact economic growth, said economists, warning activity could contract late this year, leading to a far smaller Q4 annualized gain. “Much of the focus is now on the fourth quarter and what happens early next year,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, though he added the “modest growth” seen for October was encouraging. “The economy had a bit of momentum going into the shutdowns,” he said. On Monday, Canada’s Liberal-led government unveiled a historic C$381.6 billion deficit and pledged up to C$100 billion in stimulus spending to “jumpstart” the recovery, once the virus is under control.

FILE PHOTO: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listens while wearing a mask at a news conference held to discuss the country's coronavirus disease (COVID-19) response in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada November 6, 2020. REUTERS/Patrick Doyle//File Photo Five sources familiar with the thinking in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party say a snap election is likely at some point in 2021 rather than at the scheduled end of the legislature in 2023. But they added that current polls show a majority win is far from certain and said not everyone in the party wants a vote. Last year, the ruling Liberals won only a minority of seats in the House of Commons, leaving them reliant on opposition parties to survive. Minority governments have traditionally not lasted more than a couple of years. “The problem about leaving an election until 2022 is that we will look less fresh, and if people are fed up they could be looking for an alternative by then,” said one senior Liberal. Another senior Liberal source said that the spring budget, expected in March or April, would be a litmus test. Should it pass with opposition support, then an election may be off the table, at least for the first half of the year. On Monday, Trudeau’s government promised as much as C$100 billion ($77.18 billion) in temporary stimulus starting with the 2021 budget, and it is getting ready to distribute a vaccine early next year, having lined up more potential doses per capita than any other country in the world. ‘A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY’ Liberal insiders say the 48-year-old Trudeau, son of Pierre who was the third-longest serving prime minister in Canadian history, is determined to lead the party into the next election and win a majority. The government’s approval rating is high, around 60%, on Trudeau’s management of the pandemic, but the Liberal lead over the rival Conservative Party is only about 4 percentage points, which would probably not be enough to win a majority of seats in parliament, said Darrell Bricker, chief executive officer of Ipsos Public Affairs polling company. “There’s a degree of certainty” the government will seek a vote next year, Bricker said. In 2021 the stimulus money will be “priming the pump” and potentially a vaccine will have restored confidence, but there will need to be positive momentum for the Liberals against their main rivals before the conditions are right, Bricker said. If Trudeau wants a vote, he has two main options: He can deliberately make the budget so unpalatable that the opposition brings him down, or he can go to the governor-general, who is the representative of Queen Elizabeth, Canada’s head of State, and ask for an election. Another reason to try for one sooner rather than later is that the Liberals’ main challengers are the Conservatives, whose leader Erin O’Toole was only elected in August, and he has had little chance to introduce himself to Canadians during the pandemic. “I am reasonably confident none of the opposition parties wants an election right now,” Trudeau said on Tuesday.
