For decades, women have turned to Women’s Place shelters in Niagara Falls and Welland for confidential and compassionate support when faced with the difficult issue of abuse. Whether it is your partner or another loved one who is hurting you emotionally or physically, our counsellors will listen to you. They will believe you. They will not judge you. They will help you to figure out your options… and you don’t have to stay in one of our shelters to get help. Contact us. Let’s work together to figure out your next steps.
