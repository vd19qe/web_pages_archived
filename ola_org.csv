Bill 159 has been enacted as Chapter 14 of the Statutes of Ontario, 2020. Schedule 1 Condominium Act, 1998 Various amendments are made to the Condominium Act, 1998. Among the amendments: 1. Changes are made to the Minister’s powers with respect to the members of the board of the condominium authority. For example, the Minister may provide that no more than a fixed percentage of members of the board of directors shall be drawn from among the persons or classes of persons specified in the order. 2. The Minister may consult with the condominium authority about proposed legislative or policy changes. 3. The provisions regarding the liability of the condominium authority and of the Crown are modified to increase consistency among related pieces of legislation. 4. The Minister may require the condominium authority to make publicly available information relating to compensation and other payments made to its directors, officers and employees. 5. The Minister may appoint an administrator of the condominium authority, subject to certain limitations. Schedule 2 Condominium Management Services Act, 2015 The Condominium Management Services Act, 2015 is amended to reflect the fact that this Act will become “designated legislation” for the purposes of the Safety and Consumer Statutes Administration Act, 1996. Also, the Minister may delegate some or all regulation-making power to the administrative authority subject to approval of the Minister. Schedule 3 Consumer Protection Act, 2002 The Schedule amends the Consumer Protection Act, 2002 to add an administrative penalty scheme and to make related amendments. Amendments are also made to sections 111, 112 and 114 of the Act in relation to the enforcement of requirements under the Act. SChedule 4 New Home Construction Licensing Act, 2017 The Schedule amends the New Home Construction Licensing Act, 2017. The majority of the amendments have the effect of permitting the regulatory authority under the Act to interact with the Corporation designated under the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act as applicable while that Act is in force. The provisions regarding the liability of the regulatory authority and the Crown are modified to increase consistency among related pieces of legislation. Other technical amendments are made, including amendments relating to the administrative agreement between the Minister and the regulatory authority and amendments relating to the regulation-making powers in the Act. Schedule 5 Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act The Schedule amends the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act. Previous amendments to the Act provided for the Act’s repeal. The Schedule provides that different provisions of the Act may be repealed on different dates by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor. The Schedule amends the Act to provide for this phased repeal. The majority of the amendments have the effect of permitting the Corporation designated under the Act to interact, while the Act is in force and as applicable, with the regulatory authority under the New Home Construction Licensing Act, 2017. Amendments are made to allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council to revoke the designation of the Corporation by regulation. The Lieutenant Governor in Council’s regulation-making powers in the Act are expanded. Amendments are made relating to the entering into of an administrative agreement between the Minister and the Corporation.
