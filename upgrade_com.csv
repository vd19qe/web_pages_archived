Your cash back will typically be applied to your balance after your next scheduled monthly payment. Cash back rewards applied to your balance will not satisfy or reduce your regular monthly payments. Payments on non-purchase transactions, such as sending funds electronically to your bank account, are not eligible to earn rewards. Certain limitations apply. Please refer to your Cardholder Agreement for more information. Rewards associated with the Upgrade Card, when applicable, are provided by Upgrade, Inc. ** Credit Lines opened through Upgrade feature APRs of 8.99% - 29.99% and line amounts ranging $500 - $50,000. The lowest rates require Autopay and the majority of the line amounts will be $25,000 or under. For example, a $5,000 transaction with a 36 month term and a 19.99% APR has a required monthly payment of $187.90. The APR on your draw may be higher or lower. Your rate, line amount, and default term depend on maintaining a qualifying credit score, your credit usage history, requested amount, and other factors. *** The Upgrade Card cannot be used at an ATM. If there are changes to your credit score or other risk factors based on a soft inquiry, or changes to market conditions, the availability of your remaining credit, the interest rate, and length of the credit offered may be adjusted for future transactions. The terms on your existing balances will never change. You will be given the opportunity to accept new terms before requesting future transactions if you wish to continue using your line. Transactions will be subject to a minimum draw amount, which is determined based on your total line availability. There is no minimum draw amount when you use the Upgrade Card. Based on the amount you spend in total we may ask you to confirm a new line agreement to continue to provide you with additional credit. Personal loans made through Upgrade feature APRs of 5.94%-35.97%. All personal loans have a 2.9% to 8% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.98% APR (which includes a 14.32% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $343.33. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,359.97. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early. Information about our state licenses can be found here. Copyright 2021 Upgrade, Inc. All rights reserved.

Your cash back will typically be applied to your balance after your next scheduled monthly payment. Purchases in Home, Auto, and Health categories earn 3% cash back when you pay them back; all other purchases earn 1% with no maximum. Merchants are assigned a merchant category code (MCC) based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar MCCs into categories for purposes of making rewards available to you, but we do not assign MCCs. Merchants set their own MCC, therefore purchases may not fall into the category where you might expect them to appear. For more information on merchant categories, please click here. Cash back rewards applied to your balance will not satisfy or reduce your regular monthly payments. Payments on non-purchase transactions, such as sending funds electronically to your bank account, are not eligible to earn rewards. Some limitations apply. Please refer to your Cardholder Agreement for more information. Rewards associated with the Upgrade Card, when applicable, are provided by Upgrade, Inc. ** Credit Lines opened through Upgrade feature APRs of 8.99% - 29.99% and line amounts ranging $500 - $50,000. The lowest rates require Autopay and the majority of the line amounts will be $25,000 or under. For example, a $5,000 transaction with a 36 month term and a 19.99% APR has a required monthly payment of $187.90. The APR on your draw may be higher or lower. Your rate, line amount, and default term depend on maintaining a qualifying credit score, your credit usage history, requested amount, and other factors. *** The Upgrade Card cannot be used at an ATM. 1 There are no account fees, overdraft fees, annual fees, or transfer fees associated with Rewards Checking accounts. Rewards Checking charges no ATM fees, but third-party institutions may charge you a fee if you use their ATM/network or if you use your Upgrade VISA® Debit Card internationally. Upgrade will rebate any ATM fee charged by another institution for debit card withdrawals in the United States, up to five times per calendar month. To be eligible to receive third-party ATM fee rebates in any calendar month for eligible ATM withdrawals made during that month, customers must have (i) an open Rewards Checking account and (ii) either maintained an average daily balance in their account of at least $2,500 in the prior calendar month or made direct deposits into their account totaling at least $1,000 during the prior calendar month. As a courtesy to new customers, Upgrade will provide third-party ATM fee rebates for up to the first 2 calendar months after account opening regardless of account activity. Some limitations apply. Please refer to the applicable Cross River Bank Deposit Account Agreement and Upgrade VISA® Debit Card Agreement and Disclosures for more information. 2 Rewards Checking customers earn 2% cash back on common everyday expenses at convenience stores, drugstores, restaurants and bars - including deliveries - and gas stations, as well as recurring payments on utilities and monthly subscriptions including phone, cable, TV and other streaming services, and 1% cash back on all other debit card charges. 2% cash back is limited to $500 in rewards per calendar year; after $500, customers earn 1% cash back on all eligible debit card charges for the remainder of the year. Some limitations apply. Please refer to the applicable Upgrade VISA® Debit Card Agreement and Disclosures for more information. 3 The interest rate on a new loan or credit line through Upgrade may be up to 20% lower than would otherwise be applicable without this discount, as long as you have an active Rewards Checking Account. Additional terms may apply. Please refer to the applicable Truth-in-Lending Disclosure and Loan Agreement. † Accept your loan offer and your funds will be sent to your bank or designated account within one (1) business day of clearing necessary verifications. Availability of the funds is dependent on how quickly your bank processes the transaction. From the time of approval, funds sent directly to you should be available within one (1) business day. Funds sent directly to pay off your creditors may take up to 2 weeks to clear, depending on the creditor. Personal loans made through Upgrade feature APRs of 5.94%-35.97%. All personal loans have a 2.9% to 8% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.98% APR (which includes a 14.32% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $343.33. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,359.97. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early. Information about our state licenses can be found here. Copyright 2021 Upgrade, Inc. All rights reserved.
