With the new Regional Relief and Recovery Fund, the Government of Canada is nearly doubling the annual budgets of Canada’s six regional development agencies (RDAs). The Fund is an immediate $962 million support measure to protect Canadian jobs and to help Canadians and businesses through this period of uncertainty. The distribution of the RRRF to each RDA took into consideration the size and need of each region of Canada while ensuring that each RDA was adequately resourced to help cash-strapped entrepreneurs in their respective regions who are unable to access the government’s existing COVID-19 support measures. A strong Canadian economy requires that SMEs in all regions of Canada are not falling through the cracks and get the support they need to remain in operation now and into the future. The RDAs will work with the Community Futures Network of Canada to make every effort to extend the RRRF to as many SMEs as possible to ensure no business is left behind; however, we recognize that demand for funds may exceed what is available in every region. The RRRF is distributed among the six RDAs as follows: Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency: $110.05 million Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions: $211 million Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario: $252.4 million Federal Economic Development initiative for Northern Ontario: $49.5 million Western Economic Diversification Canada: $304.2 million Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency: $34.3 million Application Process 17) How do I apply?
