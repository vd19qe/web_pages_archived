Please do your part to help flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

To find out what this means for you, visit our FAQ. The Town of Grimsby is working closely with Niagara Region Public Health to monitor the COVID-19 situation and put measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff. Updates will be shared as they become available. Recent Updates A video message from Mayor Jeff Jordan A reminder to all residents that the Town of Grimsby is currently in a State of Emergency. Please do your part to help flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario. Public Health information is available at the bottom of this page. How many cases of COVID-19 are in Niagara? Visit Niagara Region Public Health's Statistics Page for current regional case information. Are all Town Facilities Closed?

All outdoor recreational amenities are closed. This includes playgrounds, pavilions, benches, basketball and tennis courts and sports fields. What can I do in a Grimsby Park during COVID-19? Can I sit in a park, have a picnic or gather to visit with a neighbour or friend? No, you cannot. No gatherings of any kind are permitted in Town parks, including the use of benches, gazebos, pavilions etc. even when using social distancing. Can I gather with Neighbours outside, if we maintain 6 feet, in groups of more then five? No. There are no gatherings of five or more people, unless your household is more than five people. Right now, it's more important than ever to stay home unless for an essential outing like the grocery store or pharmacy This means, even if you maintain 6 feet: no gatherings for bonfires no faith-based holiday extended family/friends meals (Easter, Passover) no happy hours or front porch get-togethers no backyard parties no driveway parties no team street hockey What businesses are open and which are closed? Non-essential business must close Remain open: Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants offering takeout/delivery/curbside pickup, & businesses deemed essential may remain open?

Do not call 9-1-1 Am I able to take waste to the landfill?

Waste collection schedules remain unchanged due to COVID-19, however there may be additional delays at this time. Leaf and yard collections may also be delayed.

Visit our Fire Prevention and Education page for more information. Can I fish from shore in Town Parks? The parks and beaches are open for ‘walk through’ only, and we are asking that there be no gathering, lingering or recreating of other kinds in our parks. While fishing may be permitted at the Ministry level, these activities lead to longer visits in parks and potential gathering, so we are asking that those activities not occur in our parks at this time.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

To find out what this means for you, visit our FAQ. The Town of Grimsby is working closely with Niagara Region Public Health to monitor the COVID-19 situation and put measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff. Updates will be shared as they become available. Recent Updates A message from Mayor Jeff Jordan Feed Hope - Community Food Drive A reminder to all residents that the Town of Grimsby is currently in a State of Emergency. Please do your part to help flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario. Public Health information is available at the bottom of this page. How many cases of COVID-19 are in Niagara? Visit Niagara Region Public Health's Statistics Page for current regional case information. Are all Town Facilities Closed? Yes, all Town of Grimsby facilities are closed to the public until further notice. Many services are still available by phone & email. Please visit our Contact Us page to direct any inquiries. Are Grimsby's Parks closed? Parks currently closed are: Southward Park Steve McDonnell Dog Park Oakes Road Dog Run Skate Park All other Town owned Parks are OPEN for walk through us only. All outdoor recreational amenities are closed. This includes playgrounds, pavilions, benches, basketball and tennis courts and sports fields. What can I do in a Grimsby Park during COVID-19? Can I sit in a park, have a picnic or gather to visit with a neighbour or friend? No, you cannot. No gatherings of any kind are permitted in Town parks, including the use of benches, gazebos, pavilions etc. even when using social distancing. Why are Town staff still working in parks? Park maintenance is getting underway including grass cutting and trimming. This work ensures that parks are kept clean and safe. This work also controls for ticks and weeds, and ensures good quality turf on sports fields and in parks. While many new projects and enhancement work is on hold at this time, staff are continuing some maintenance work to ensure that parks and sports fields are kept in good condition and will be ready for use once the time comes for our residents to enjoy our public spaces again. Can I gather with Neighbours outside, if we maintain 6 feet, in groups of more then five? No. There are no gatherings of five or more people, unless your household is more than five people. Right now, it's more important than ever to stay home unless for an essential outing like the grocery store or pharmacy This means, even if you maintain 6 feet: no gatherings for bonfires no faith-based holiday extended family/friends meals (Easter, Passover) no happy hours or front porch get-togethers no backyard parties no driveway parties no team street hockey What businesses are open and which are closed? Non-essential business must close Remain open: Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants offering takeout/delivery/curbside pickup, & businesses deemed essential may remain open?

If the matter is more urgent or other attempts are unsuccessful call the Niagara Region Police COVID-19 Enforcement support line @ 1-866-389-7638. Do not call 9-1-1 Am I able to take waste to the landfill?

Waste collection schedules remain unchanged due to COVID-19, however there may be additional delays at this time. Leaf and yard collections may also be delayed. Leaf and yard collections also have a 3 bag maximum per week (starting week of April 13). PLease bag and tie all waste for the protection of the staff. For further details please visit the Niagara Regions Waste Collection web page. Can I have a fire in my backyard? Grimsby’s burn by-law prohibits recreational fires within the urban boundaries. Help our firefighters stay safe by reducing these unnecessary call responses and limiting our physical contact – please stop having any backyard fire. Visit our Fire Prevention and Education page for more information. Can I fish from shore in Town Parks? The parks and beaches are open for ‘walk through’ only, and we are asking that there be no gathering, lingering or recreating of other kinds in our parks. While fishing may be permitted at the Ministry level, these activities lead to longer visits in parks and potential gathering, so we are asking that those activities not occur in our parks at this time.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

To find out what this means for you, visit our FAQ. The Town of Grimsby is working closely with Niagara Region Public Health to monitor the COVID-19 situation and put measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff. Updates will be shared as they become available. Latest News May 15th 2020 - Town of Grimsby, Niagara Region and area municipalities relax rules at parks and open spaces COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario. Public Health information is available at the bottom of this page. How many cases of COVID-19 are in Niagara? Visit Niagara Region Public Health's Statistics Page for current regional case information. Are all Town Facilities Closed? Yes, all Town of Grimsby facilities are closed to the public until further notice. Many services are still available by phone & email. Please visit our Contact Us page to direct any inquiries. Are Grimsby's Parks open with the recent provincial announcement? Municipally owned parks are open for walk-through use, and for limited recreational activities with members of your immediate household such as: Playing catch, throwing a Frisbee, kicking a ball, flying a kite and other such activities Bringing a chair or blanket to relax in parks Individual activities such as yoga and fitness exercises provided they are not in a group or class Additional openings of facilities as part of the phase one announcements, such as dog parks and tennis courts will be forthcoming and we ask the public to remain patient as staff prepare these facilities over the coming days. All outdoor recreational amenities remain closed, including playgrounds, pavilions, benches, basketball and tennis courts and sports fields. What can I do in a Grimsby Park during COVID-19? Can I sit in a park, have a picnic or gather to visit with a neighbour or friend? No, you cannot. No gatherings of any kind with members outside your household are permitted in Town parks, including the use of benches, gazebos, pavilions etc. even when using social distancing. You are welcome to sit in a lawnchair or on a blanket with members of your immediate household only. Why are Town staff still working in parks? Park maintenance is getting underway including grass cutting and trimming. This work ensures that parks are kept clean and safe. This work also controls for ticks and weeds, and ensures good quality turf on sports fields and in parks. While many new projects and enhancement work is on hold at this time, staff are continuing some maintenance work to ensure that parks and sports fields are kept in good condition and will be ready for use once the time comes for our residents to enjoy our public spaces again. Can I gather with Neighbours outside, if we maintain 6 feet, in groups of more then five? No. There are no gatherings of five or more people, unless your household is more than five people. Right now, it's more important than ever to stay home unless for an essential outing like the grocery store or pharmacy This means, even if you maintain 6 feet: no gatherings for bonfires no faith-based holiday extended family/friends meals (Easter, Passover) no happy hours or front porch get-togethers no backyard parties no driveway parties no team street hockey What businesses are open and which are closed? Non-essential business must close Remain open: Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants offering takeout/delivery/curbside pickup, & businesses deemed essential may remain open? Can other businesses remain open? These businesses can continue ONLY with curb side pick-up or delivery: Hardware stores, vehicle parts and supplies, pet and animal supplies, office supplies and computer products including computer repair, safety supplies, must be through curbside pickup or delivery.

If the matter is more urgent or other attempts are unsuccessful call the Niagara Region Police COVID-19 Enforcement support line @ 1-866-389-7638. Do not call 9-1-1 Am I able to take waste to the landfill?

Help our firefighters stay safe by reducing these unnecessary call responses and limiting our physical contact – please stop having any backyard fire. Visit our Fire Prevention and Education page for more information. Can I fish from shore in Town Parks? The parks and beaches are open for ‘walk through’ only, and we are asking that there be no gathering, lingering or recreating of other kinds in our parks. While fishing may be permitted at the Ministry level, these activities lead to longer visits in parks and potential gathering, so we are asking that those activities not occur in our parks at this time.

To find out what this means for you, visit our FAQ. The Town of Grimsby is working closely with Niagara Region Public Health to monitor the COVID-19 situation and put measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff. Updates will be shared as they become available. Latest News May 15th 2020 - Town of Grimsby, Niagara Region and area municipalities relax rules at parks and open spaces COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario. Public Health information is available at the bottom of this page. How many cases of COVID-19 are in Niagara?

Are Grimsby's Parks open with the recent provincial announcement? Municipally owned parks are open for walk-through use, and for limited recreational activities with members of your immediate household such as: Playing catch, throwing a Frisbee, kicking a ball, flying a kite and other such activities Bringing a chair or blanket to relax in parks Individual activities such as yoga and fitness exercises provided they are not in a group or class Additional openings of facilities as part of the phase one announcements, such as dog parks and tennis courts will be forthcoming and we ask the public to remain patient as staff prepare these facilities over the coming days. All outdoor recreational amenities remain closed, including playgrounds, pavilions, benches, basketball and tennis courts and sports fields. What can I do in a Grimsby Park during COVID-19? Can I sit in a park, have a picnic or gather to visit with a neighbour or friend? No, you cannot. No gatherings of any kind with members outside your household are permitted in Town parks, including the use of benches, gazebos, pavilions etc. even when using social distancing. You are welcome to sit in a lawnchair or on a blanket with members of your immediate household only. Why are Town staff still working in parks? Park maintenance is getting underway including grass cutting and trimming. This work ensures that parks are kept clean and safe. This work also controls for ticks and weeds, and ensures good quality turf on sports fields and in parks. While many new projects and enhancement work is on hold at this time, staff are continuing some maintenance work to ensure that parks and sports fields are kept in good condition and will be ready for use once the time comes for our residents to enjoy our public spaces again. Can I gather with Neighbours outside, if we maintain 6 feet, in groups of more then five? No. There are no gatherings of five or more people, unless your household is more than five people. Right now, it's more important than ever to stay home unless for an essential outing like the grocery store or pharmacy This means, even if you maintain 6 feet: no gatherings for bonfires no faith-based holiday extended family/friends meals (Easter, Passover) no happy hours or front porch get-togethers no backyard parties no driveway parties no team street hockey What businesses are open and which are closed? Non-essential business must close Remain open: Grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants offering takeout/delivery/curbside pickup, & businesses deemed essential may remain open? Can other businesses remain open? These businesses can continue ONLY with curb side pick-up or delivery: Hardware stores, vehicle parts and supplies, pet and animal supplies, office supplies and computer products including computer repair, safety supplies, must be through curbside pickup or delivery.

If the matter is more urgent or other attempts are unsuccessful call the Niagara Region Police COVID-19 Enforcement support line @ 1-866-389-7638. Do not call 9-1-1 Am I able to take waste to the landfill? Please see the Niagara Region's Temporary Waste Collection Changes due to COVID-19 page for up to date information on landfills and waste collection. Have changes be made to waste collection? Waste collection schedules remain unchanged due to COVID-19, however there may be additional delays at this time. Leaf and yard collections may also be delayed.

Help our firefighters stay safe by reducing these unnecessary call responses and limiting our physical contact – please stop having any backyard fire. Visit our Fire Prevention and Education page for more information. Can I fish from shore in Town Parks? The parks and beaches are open for ‘walk through’ only, and we are asking that there be no gathering, lingering or recreating of other kinds in our parks. While fishing may be permitted at the Ministry level, these activities lead to longer visits in parks and potential gathering, so we are asking that those activities not occur in our parks at this time.

If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration.

An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year.

McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September.

Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 2 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available. Latest News June 23 2020 - Summer camp registration is now open.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind.

Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase.

McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 2 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 2 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency.

We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 2 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Latest News Niagara Regional Council adopts mandatory mask by-law to combat the spread of COVID-19 (July 23) News Release Face Covering Information and FAQ Face Covering By-law COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency.

It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

Staff will be there to take your calls between the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Saturday. Is the Grimsby Author Series cancelled or postponed? It is with extreme regret that we write to announce the cancellation of the Grimsby Author Series Spring Season as a result of the ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all of you for your support, understanding and patience as we considered the options of postponement vs. cancellation. We know how disappointing this is and we are very sorry, however, we feel that this is the only responsible decision we can take at this time. An enormous amount of work has gone in to the organization and preparation of this event. The Grimsby Author Series is not only a well regarded and much anticipated event, it is also the main fundraiser for the Grimsby Public Library each year. As such the decision to cancel was not made lightly, rather it was made with the health and safety and best interests of our attendees, authors, volunteers and staff in mind. Refunds In these special circumstances, the library will be issuing refunds. This process will be different depending on where/how you purchased your tickets. Online ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price only through Eventbrite. The ticket price will be refunded directly to the card used for the purchase. Tickets purchased at the library: Please retain your tickets and bring them to the library (once we reopen) in order to arrange for a cheque to be issued to refund you the package cost Tickets must be produced to allow for a refund to be processed. McMaster Alumni ticket holders will be refunded the ticket price directly from McMaster Almuni. Donate to the Library The Grimsby Public Library depends on the funds from the Grimsby Author Series to be able to provide services, purchase collections and to offer programming to our community. Unfortunately, this means that the cancellation of the Spring 2020 season will have a significant negative impact on the library’s budget. If you are in a position to donate back the price of your ticket package we would be very grateful. The Grimsby Public Library is a registered charity and would gladly accept your donation through CanadaHelps.org. Thank you for your consideration. Donate to the Grimsby Public Library Fall 2020 Season Meanwhile, the Grimsby Author Series Steering Committee is busy planning a wonderful lineup of authors for the Fall 2020 series. However, we will continue to monitor and follow the best advice of Public Health officials and our government leaders to ensure that it is safe to proceed in September. Along with you, we look forward to being able to gather again in celebration of talented Canadian Authors. Thank you for your ongoing support during this challenging time. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and well. We look forward to seeing you all again in the fall.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 2 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Latest News Niagara Regional Council adopts mandatory mask by-law to combat the spread of COVID-19 (July 23) News Release Face Covering Information and FAQ Face Covering By-law COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available. Latest News Sept 17: Niagara Region extends Face Covering Bylaw. Further Details Sept 19: Ontario government announces reduction in gathering limits for private, unmonitored gatherings across Ontario. The reduced limits are: 10 people at an indoor event or gathering (previous limit of 50); or 25 people at an outdoor event or gathering (previous limit of 100). Full news release COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario. Public Health information is available at the bottom of this page. How many cases of COVID-19 are in Niagara? Visit Niagara Region Public Health's Statistics Page for current regional case information. Can Sports Fields be used? Sports Fields are Open for passive use provided Provincial gathering limits are observed and participants practice physical distancing. Established Leagues looking to resume Sport activities must contact the Parks, Recreation and Culture department @ 905-945-1288. For inquiries regarding municipal services - please see the contact us page. What businesses are open and which are closed? For an up to date list on current business restrictions please visit the Government of Ontario's website When am I required to wear a mask? On Sept. 17, 2020, Niagara Regional Council extended the temporary face covering by-law (By-law 2020-46) to require residents to wear mandatory face coverings in enclosed public places, and on Regional and municipal transit during the COVID-19 pandemic. This by-law is to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in indoor public spaces as more businesses and services begin to reopen.

Full news release COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available. Latest News Sept 17: Niagara Region extends Face Covering Bylaw. Further Details Sept 19: Ontario government announces reduction in gathering limits for private, unmonitored gatherings across Ontario. The reduced limits are: 10 people at an indoor event or gathering (previous limit of 50); or 25 people at an outdoor event or gathering (previous limit of 100). Full news release COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario. Public Health information is available at the bottom of this page. How many cases of COVID-19 are in Niagara?

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available. Latest News Oct 23: Niagara Region amends Face-Covering By-law to include common areas or apartments and condominiums Oct 20: Ontario government suggests ways to Halloween safely Oct 2: Provincial face covering requirements Sept 19: Ontario government announces reduction in gathering limits for private, unmonitored gatherings across Ontario. The reduced limits are: 10 people at an indoor event or gathering (previous limit of 50); or 25 people at an outdoor event or gathering (previous limit of 100). Full news release COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario. Public Health information is available at the bottom of this page. How many cases of COVID-19 are in Niagara?

COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

It is a budget that enables continued momentum on Council’s Strategic Priorities, provides support for our local residents and businesses, and ensures a safe operating environment for our customers and employees. Approved Budget 2021 Highlights include: Investing in a Grimsby Beach Study, a Main Street East Comprehensive Strategy a Trails Master Plan, and a Downtown Reimagined Project Supporting the business sector with a second year of an expanded patio program, and planned business retention and expansion initiatives Improving the Casablanca QEW Interchange Improving our parks and open spaces through playground renewal, park improvements, and creating the new Casablanca Waterfront Park Planting more trees, protecting our Shoreline and rebuilding the Gibson St pedestrian bridge Providing transportation options through continued investment in NRT OnDemand Improving community facilities through accessibility improvements, replacing the HVAC system at the Grimsby Public Library and Art Gallery and continuing design work for a future Peach King Centre Expansion Continuing with a special levy to ensure that Grimsby’s contribution to the NEW West Lincoln Memorial Hospital is in place Engaging in partnerships with Niagara Region Public Health to support the vaccination roll out for Grimsby residents who wish to participate. The operating and capital works associated with the 2021 Budget results in a 1.81 per cent tax levy increase over 2020. This increase amounts to an additional $21 per year ($1.75 a month), for an average residential household assessed at $443,686. This budget was created with a careful line of sight to financial sustainability and taxpayer affordability. Grimsby has the second lowest residential property tax per $100,000 of assessment, and also holds the lowest rate of combined water, sewer and taxes (as a percentage of household income – 2020). “The Town of Grimsby team has diligently worked to ensure that this budget builds on the 2020 momentum, while also ensuring that we are caring for the community. The Covid-19 pandemic has placed many challenges upon our Corporation, but our collective team and community partners continue to respond with a resilient spirit.” Harry Schlange, CAO “The 2021 Budget provides an excellent balance of advancing Council’s priorities, while sustaining current service levels. This Council will continue to advance the priorities that we heard from the community: strong financial management, responsible development, preservation of our distinct heritage and culture, transportation, road safety, protecting our environment, and providing quality amenities for our growing population. The future for Grimsby is exciting.” Mayor Jeff Jordan Back to Search Contact Us Search News Close Full Living In Menu Accessibility Cemeteries Daycares and Preschools Education and Schools Emergency Services and Safety Toggle Section Emergency Services and Safety Menu Fire Department Toggle Section Fire Department Menu Emergency Preparedness Fire Prevention and Education Grimsby Regional Training Centre Recruitment Training Garbage and Recycling Health Care and Wellness Let's Talk Grimsby Maps Parks, Recreation and Culture Places of Worship Property taxes Toggle Section Property taxes Menu Paying your property taxes Property assessment Property Tax Due Dates and Penalties Tax rates Finance forms Roads, Sidewalks and Parking Toggle Section Roads, Sidewalks and Parking Menu Parking Roads and Sidewalks Maintenance Snow Removal Traffic Signal Crossing Transportation Toggle Section Transportation Menu Traffic Signal Crossing Transportation options in Grimsby Utilities Water Services Toggle Section Water Services Menu Backflow Prevention Drinking Water in the Niagara Region Drinking Water Quality Sanitary Sewers Water Billing Toggle Section Water Billing Menu Water Payment Options Finance forms A to Z ServicesContact UsReport ItSitemapDisclaimer and PrivacyJob Opportunities © 2018 Town of Grimsby - 160 Livingston Avenue, Grimsby ON, L3M 4G3 - Phone: 905-945-9634 - Fax: 905-945-5010 Designed by eSolutionsGroup"

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency.

On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

See the Ontario website for more information. On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Ontario Shutdown Measures - website link On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Follow the restrictions and public health measures. On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Follow the restrictions and public health measures. On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Follow the restrictions and public health measures. On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively. Updates will be shared here and through social media as they become available.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Follow the restrictions and public health measures. On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Stage 3 of the provincial re-opening framework. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Follow the restrictions and public health measures. On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Step 3 of the provincial Roadmap to Reopen. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency.

The new system will also improve efficiency and provide an improved control system. “As the Grimsby Public Library and Art Gallery look forward to welcoming the community back into our wonderful joint-use facility, we know that a renewed HVAC system will benefit our staff, visitors, collections and art work,” said Kathryn Drury, CEO & Chief Librarian of Grimsby’s Public Library. “We have all become much more aware of the crucial role ventilation plays in managing the spread of COVID-19 and other air-borne afflictions; a well-functioning HVAC system is crucial for maintaining the health as well as the comfort of everyone in the building. We are grateful that the ICIP grant will help make this much needed replacement possible,” said Rhona Wenger, Grimsby Public Art Gallery Manager/Curator. Replacement of the Gibson Street pedestrian bridge This bridge connects Gibson St. over the 40 Mile Creek for pedestrian uses. The bridge will be fully accessible, will have lighting and will ensure safe crossings in a very well travelled area. “The Gibson Street Bridge, which was originally constructed in 1986, provides an important pedestrian crossing over the Forty Mile Creek, carrying a section of the Bruce Trail’s main trail through the Town of Grimsby. The existing bridge was closed in the summer of 2020 as a safety precaution due to corrosion of the underlying structural steel,” said Brandon Wartman, Director of Public Works. “The funding being provided through the ICIP will allow the Town to construct a brand new pedestrian bridge structure that will bring great benefit to the Grimsby community long into the future.” The federal and provincial funding awarded will not only improve the Town’s resiliency in preventing the spread of COVID-19, but will also support active transportation networks that residents will be able to enjoy as the province begins to reopen. Both of these projects are intended to be completed late 2021 – early 2022. Members of the community are encouraged to visit the Town of Grimsby website for updates related to the two projects.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

The new system will also improve efficiency and provide an improved control system. “As the Grimsby Public Library and Art Gallery look forward to welcoming the community back into our wonderful joint-use facility, we know that a renewed HVAC system will benefit our staff, visitors, collections and art work,” said Kathryn Drury, CEO & Chief Librarian of Grimsby’s Public Library. “We have all become much more aware of the crucial role ventilation plays in managing the spread of COVID-19 and other air-borne afflictions; a well-functioning HVAC system is crucial for maintaining the health as well as the comfort of everyone in the building. We are grateful that the ICIP grant will help make this much needed replacement possible,” said Rhona Wenger, Grimsby Public Art Gallery Manager/Curator. Replacement of the Gibson Street pedestrian bridge This bridge connects Gibson St. over the 40 Mile Creek for pedestrian uses. The bridge will be fully accessible, will have lighting and will ensure safe crossings in a very well travelled area. “The Gibson Street Bridge, which was originally constructed in 1986, provides an important pedestrian crossing over the Forty Mile Creek, carrying a section of the Bruce Trail’s main trail through the Town of Grimsby. The existing bridge was closed in the summer of 2020 as a safety precaution due to corrosion of the underlying structural steel,” said Brandon Wartman, Director of Public Works. “The funding being provided through the ICIP will allow the Town to construct a brand new pedestrian bridge structure that will bring great benefit to the Grimsby community long into the future.” The federal and provincial funding awarded will not only improve the Town’s resiliency in preventing the spread of COVID-19, but will also support active transportation networks that residents will be able to enjoy as the province begins to reopen. Both of these projects are intended to be completed late 2021 – early 2022. Members of the community are encouraged to visit the Town of Grimsby website for updates related to the two projects.

The squad will begin visiting businesses in the community on July 26, 2021. “COVID-19 has brought many challenges to our Town’s brick-and-mortar businesses, so it is great to see that the Digital Main Street program will once again be running to leverage new online and digital tools to help local business owners promote their goods and service and stay competitive within and beyond the COVID context,” said Mayor Jordan. “The renewed Digital Main Street program will allow eligible Grimsby businesses to transition their operations through digital transformation to better position themselves for success and long-term sustainability, especially during these trying times.” Renewed government funding of the OPG will provide 3,000 Digital Transformation Grants to qualified bricks-and-mortar small businesses as well as Digital Service Squad grants for organizations to provide hands-on assistance to local small businesses. The OPG is administrated by the Ontario BIA Association, in partnership with the Toronto Association of BIAs (TABIA). “Ontario small businesses are the heart of our neighbourhoods and the economic foundation of our communities,” said Nina Tangri, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. “Our government is committed to being there for them as they reopen. This additional support will give these businesses the digital boost they need to raise their profile and rebuild better than ever.” The cornerstone of Digital Main Street, these squads consist of trained specialists who meet with brick-and-mortar small businesses at no cost to help them complete an online assessment and introduce them to online training modules to build their knowledge and skills. These experts can also assist businesses with developing their Digital Transformation Plan (DTP) and applying for a one-time $2,500 grant to implement it. This one-on-one DSS assistance also includes support for basic website set-up, Google My Business profiles, 360º photos, social media presence, and much more. The DSS can also provide information on the ShopHERE program, if applicable, to assist with digital storefront set-up and e-commerce. Where COVID-19 restrictions are in place, DSS experts can provide support through phone and video tools such as Zoom. “In the past 16 months, as small businesses across the province fought to stay open and keep customers engaged online, Digital Service Squads were there to help,” said Kay Matthews, Executive Director of OBIAA. ""Squads jumped online themselves during lockdowns to help virtually, and businesses have consistently told us how important the DSS were to their success through the pandemic. We are thrilled to support this DSS and help them provide assistance to even more small businesses than ever.” ABOUT OBIAA OBIAA is the network that represents unique and vibrant BIAs across Ontario. The Association supports and advocates on behalf of its members through the building and nurturing of strong relationships and partnerships. OBIAA is a leader in the development and sharing of information, tools, resources and best practices, and is the ONE voice on common issues. ABOUT Digital Main Street Digital Main Street is a program that helps main street businesses achieve digital transformation. The program is built around an online learning platform, structured training programs, and our Digital Service Squad, a team of street-level team members who help main street businesses grow and manage their operations through technology.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

Follow the restrictions and public health measures. On April 3, 2020, the Town of Grimsby joined with the Niagara Region and municipalities across the Region, to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Niagara Region, which includes Grimsby, in now in Step 3 of the provincial Roadmap to Reopen. The Town of Grimsby is working to gradually and safely reopen services within the Ontario government's Re-opening Framework guidelines. Working with Niagara Region Public Health and other agencies, the Corporation is putting measures in place to ensure the health and safety of Grimsby residents and staff, and to also ensure that services are restored effectively.

Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat. The declaration is also another way of conveying the severity of the situation to those in our communities who are ignoring the rules and regulations related to the COVID-19 emergency. Is there anything I should do differently during a State of Emergency? Continue to follow direction from public heath authorities such as Niagara Region Public Health and Public Health Ontario.

The implementation of shared fire services allows both municipalities to maximize their collective resources without each having to pay the full cost of such and will serve to preserve the volunteer fire service model. “This is an incredible opportunity for us to partner with the Town of Grimsby to create operational success and efficiency in both communities,” said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. “This is one way we are enhancing our existing cooperative and collaborative relationship with the Town of Grimsby.” “A chance to partner, build and foster mutually beneficial relationships with other municipalities is an important step in a sustainable future,” said the Town of Grimsby Mayor Jeff Jordan. “This model is an outstanding opportunity to work toward the collective good of our communities.” “We look forward to working with our neighbours in Grimsby to improve operational efficiencies and enhance service levels,” said Michael Kirkopoulos, CAO for the Town of Lincoln. “We continue to raise the bar by seeking opportunities for efficiencies and through shared resources – it’s one of the ways we’re demonstrating accountability and financial responsibility.” “The authorization of a shared fire services service agreement is an important step to continue to improve service levels in both communities,” said Harry Schlange, CAO for the Town of Grimsby. “This agreement will further complement our existing relationship with the Town of Lincoln.” “We are proud of the history that the volunteer fire departments and appreciate their role as a fundamental fabric of the communities,” said Fire Chief Greg Hudson. “I am honoured to be given the responsibility of Fire Chief in the jointly established Fire Department and to serve as a leader for the safety and well-being of our community.” The authorization of shared fire protection services by the Town of Grimsby Council also allows for: Jointly establish and regulate a Fire Department for the Town of Lincoln and the Town of Grimsby.

For complete rules and regulations on proof of vaccination requirements, please review the provincial regulations and guidance. Which Town of Grimsby Facilities require Proof of Vaccination?

What is the vaccination criteria for facilities that require proof? Effective September 22nd, individuals entering the Peach King Centre and Livingston Activity Centre must be fully vaccinated. An individual is considered fully vaccinated if they have received: The full series of a COVID-19 vaccine authorized by Health Canada, or any combination of such vaccines, or One or two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine not authorized by Health Canada, followed by one dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine authorized by Health Canada, or Three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine not authorized by Health Canada; and They received their final dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days before providing the proof of being fully vaccinated. How do I provide proof that I am fully vaccinated? Patrons entering the Peach King Centre and Livingston Activity Centre must provide proof of vaccination and proof of identity in order to enter the facility. Proof of vaccination will be accepted if the person’s name and date of birth on their identification document matches the vaccination receipt with name and date of birth and if the person is fully vaccinated. Providing Proof of Vaccination All Ontarians who received a vaccine were provided with a receipt at the time of vaccination. A paper copy would have been provided on site, and an email version set to the vaccine recipient. Additional copies of a COVID-19 vaccination receipt can be downloaded or printed through the COVID-19 vaccination provincial portal or obtained by calling the Provincial Vaccine Booking Line at 1-833-943- 3900. All versions of the receipt are acceptable as proof of vaccination. However, a patron seeking access to the Peach King Centre and Livingston Activity Centre must provide the receipt that shows that they are fully vaccinated. An enhanced vaccine certificate, as well as a verification app to allow businesses to read the QR code, will be available beginning October 22. More information will be provided in the coming weeks. Providing Proof of Identity Proof of Identity is required to verify that the vaccine receipt presented matches that patron providing it. Proof of identity must confirm: The name of the identification holder Date of birth. Photo identification is not required. Proof of identity can be established using documentation issued by an institution or public body, provided it includes the name of the holder and date of birth. Examples of identification documents that may be used to confirm the identity of the holder of the vaccine receipt include: Birth certificate Citizenship card Driver’s licence Government (Ontario or other) issued identification card, including health card Indian Status Card /Indigenous Membership Card Passport Permanent Resident card Validation of identification is considered to have been completed/successful when the name and date of birth of the presenter of the vaccination receipt and the name and date of birth on the identification document match. If the name and date of birth on both documents do not match, the individual will not be allowed to enter the Facility or activity. Are there exemptions for proof of vaccination? The proof of identification and proof of vaccination against COVID-19 requirements under O. Reg. 364/20 do not apply to: Volunteers, coaches and officials (when actively carrying out these roles) Patrons entering an indoor area solely for the following purposes: to use a washroom; to access customer service or pay a bill to purchase admission (for an event not requiring proof of vaccination) as may be necessary for the purposes of health and safety.

Patrons under the age of 12 must be accompanied by an adult and parents/guardians accompanying a child are not exempt from proof of vaccination requirements. Patrons under 18 years of age who are entering the facility solely for the purpose of actively participating in an organized sport. The exemption relating to Youth under 18 years of age activity participating in indoor organized sport applies to training, practices, games and competition.

Does a previous COVID-19 infection allow you to attend facilities requiring proof of vaccination? No, a previous infection is not a substitute for being fully vaccinated. COVID-19 Municipal FAQ We continue to receive questions regarding various scenarios. Please see the answers below for clarification. What is a State of Emergency? An emergency is defined under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act as “a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease or other health risk, an accident or an act whether intentional or otherwise.” What does declaring an emergency do? Declaring an emergency together with the Niagara Region and other local municipalities underscores the critical nature of the COVID-19 situation. It further demonstrates that the Town and the Region are taking every step possible to protect residents from the Coronavirus threat.
