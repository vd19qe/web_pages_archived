Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

The name itself - The City - comes from Matthew 5:14 - “You are the light of the world. A city situated on a hill cannot be hidden.”. We meet regularly on Thursday nights from 6:30 - 8:30. The night consists of games and laughter, worship and teaching, prayer and community. We have 12 student leaders, our Campus Ministry Team (CMT’s), who lead our break out small groups on Thursday and help facilitate discussion and lead in prayer. They also serve in Chapel - either on the worship team, or to read Scripture, and even give the weekly message. We have seen this ministry grow over the past 2 years seeing an average of 60-70 students come out on a weekly basis. The City is a safe place for students to be themselves and ask the tough questions of faith. In doing so, many students have come to know Jesus in a personal way and grow in their relationship with God. And to do this in community with their peers has been awesome to see develop. We are thankful to God for His unending faithfulness to us! Weekly Chapel Online Meeting together for Chapel time on Monday mornings is a way to focus our week on Jesus as a school community. We will continue with our online version of weekly Chapel meetings for our students, and post devotions, music, and some thoughts to help us focus on Jesus during this start to each week. Information on Chapel meetings will be available on Edsby.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home»Alumni Gifting Scholarships at NCC A scholarship is a grant or payment made to support a student’s education, awarded on the basis of academic or other achievement. NCC internally funds four types of scholarships for students attending our school: Academic, Music/Art, Community Service and Athletic. Other unique scholarships are also awarded which reflect the values and purpose of donors or founders of the scholarship. These types of scholarships can be created to either help the student pay for their education at NCC or to help pay for postsecondary education. Anyone can give to either NCC’s general scholarship fund or work with NCC to create a scholarship with specific criteria. Scholarships are important for students who attend NCC, as approximately 20% of our students receive scholarships to help them fund their education. Being able to offer scholarships helps NCC maintain a strong presence academically, compete in athletics, excel in the arts and attract young men and women of character to our school. For more information on supporting the NCC scholarship fund or creating a custom scholarship, contact Scott Herron at: [email protected] or call: 905.651.8374 . Endowments What is an Endowment? An endowment is a charitable gift that is invested and managed in a way that allows the gift to provide a revenue stream to NCC while maintaining the purchasing power forever. Large endowments simply create long-term stability and have a tremendous impact on strengthening academic quality. How are Endowments Created? Endowments may be created through a one-time or on-going financial gift, or they can be established through an estate gift when someone passes away. Who Can Give an Endowment? Anyone can give a gift to go towards any endowment. Typically an endowment start-up amount is $5,000. That's approximately $85 per month for 5 years. What do Endowments Pay For? The majority of NCC’s endowments create income used for student scholarships. An endowment can also be created to fund campus renovations and upkeep. A good example of this is a recent estate gift, given by the Fisher family, which was used to renovate the former snack bar. We have completely renovated this building with the funds from the estate and created an endowment for the upkeep of the Fisher Memorial Conference Room. Endowments are a great way to leave a legacy for yourself or a loved one. For more information on creating or funding an endowment, contact NCC President and CEO, Scott Herron, at [email protected] or 905-651-8374 . Capital Campaigns A capital campaign is an action plan, typically undertaken by a non-profit organization, to raise a large, specified sum of money over a given time period. Capital campaigns are most often associated with significant purchases of land, buildings and major equipment, but organizations have also initiated capital campaigns for major renovations and normal budgetary items. The money is often raised through constituent donations and public fundraising events for a cause deemed worthy by the organization and the donors. The heart of any capital campaign reflects a passionate, determined vision for the future. As a private Christian school in Ontario, NCC does not receive any government funding, nor does it have extensive endowment funds to subsidize operations or capital projects. Most of the school’s annual income comes from tuition and residence fees, and this income is budgeted to cover the yearly operation of the school. Less than 1% of the annual budget comes from donations, and unless otherwise specified, donations are applied to student aid or to campus improvements. We believe that NCC is meaningful, effective, and fruitful in the lives of our students. To accomplish our mission, the school must continually raise funds to keep its facilities attractive and equipment relevant to the students we educate and care for. This is why your donations given to a capital campaign at NCC have been, and will continue to be so valuable in driving the mission and vision of NCC forward.

The name itself - The City - comes from Matthew 5:14 - “You are the light of the world. A city situated on a hill cannot be hidden.”. We meet regularly on Thursday nights from 6:30 - 8:30. The night consists of games and laughter, worship and teaching, prayer and community. We have 12 student leaders, our Campus Ministry Team (CMT’s), who lead our break out small groups on Thursday and help facilitate discussion and lead in prayer. They also serve in Chapel - either on the worship team, or to read Scripture, and even give the weekly message. We have seen this ministry grow over the past 2 years seeing an average of 60-70 students come out on a weekly basis. The City is a safe place for students to be themselves and ask the tough questions of faith. In doing so, many students have come to know Jesus in a personal way and grow in their relationship with God. And to do this in community with their peers has been awesome to see develop. We are thankful to God for His unending faithfulness to us! Weekly Chapel Online Meeting together for Chapel time on Monday mornings is a way to focus our week on Jesus as a school community. We will continue with our online version of weekly Chapel meetings for our students, and post devotions, music, and some thoughts to help us focus on Jesus during this start to each week. Information on Chapel meetings will be available on Edsby.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour Usted está aquí Inicio»Exalumnos Gifting Scholarships at NCC A scholarship is a grant or payment made to support a student’s education, awarded on the basis of academic or other achievement. NCC internally funds four types of scholarships for students attending our school: Academic, Music/Art, Community Service and Athletic. Other unique scholarships are also awarded which reflect the values and purpose of donors or founders of the scholarship. These types of scholarships can be created to either help the student pay for their education at NCC or to help pay for postsecondary education. Anyone can give to either NCC’s general scholarship fund or work with NCC to create a scholarship with specific criteria. Scholarships are important for students who attend NCC, as approximately 20% of our students receive scholarships to help them fund their education. Being able to offer scholarships helps NCC maintain a strong presence academically, compete in athletics, excel in the arts and attract young men and women of character to our school. For more information on supporting the NCC scholarship fund or creating a custom scholarship, contact Scott Herron at: [email protected] or call: 905.651.8374 . Endowments What is an Endowment? An endowment is a charitable gift that is invested and managed in a way that allows the gift to provide a revenue stream to NCC while maintaining the purchasing power forever. Large endowments simply create long-term stability and have a tremendous impact on strengthening academic quality. How are Endowments Created? Endowments may be created through a one-time or on-going financial gift, or they can be established through an estate gift when someone passes away. Who Can Give an Endowment? Anyone can give a gift to go towards any endowment. Typically an endowment start-up amount is $5,000. That's approximately $85 per month for 5 years. What do Endowments Pay For? The majority of NCC’s endowments create income used for student scholarships. An endowment can also be created to fund campus renovations and upkeep. A good example of this is a recent estate gift, given by the Fisher family, which was used to renovate the former snack bar. We have completely renovated this building with the funds from the estate and created an endowment for the upkeep of the Fisher Memorial Conference Room. Endowments are a great way to leave a legacy for yourself or a loved one. For more information on creating or funding an endowment, contact NCC President and CEO, Scott Herron, at [email protected] or 905-651-8374 . Capital Campaigns A capital campaign is an action plan, typically undertaken by a non-profit organization, to raise a large, specified sum of money over a given time period. Capital campaigns are most often associated with significant purchases of land, buildings and major equipment, but organizations have also initiated capital campaigns for major renovations and normal budgetary items. The money is often raised through constituent donations and public fundraising events for a cause deemed worthy by the organization and the donors. The heart of any capital campaign reflects a passionate, determined vision for the future. As a private Christian school in Ontario, NCC does not receive any government funding, nor does it have extensive endowment funds to subsidize operations or capital projects. Most of the school’s annual income comes from tuition and residence fees, and this income is budgeted to cover the yearly operation of the school. Less than 1% of the annual budget comes from donations, and unless otherwise specified, donations are applied to student aid or to campus improvements. We believe that NCC is meaningful, effective, and fruitful in the lives of our students. To accomplish our mission, the school must continually raise funds to keep its facilities attractive and equipment relevant to the students we educate and care for. This is why your donations given to a capital campaign at NCC have been, and will continue to be so valuable in driving the mission and vision of NCC forward.

Our team is a dedicated group of professionals that work tirelessly to ensure all of our students are well taken care of. Your child will know he or she can always go to the administrative staff with questions and for help with day-to-day life on campus. Meet our Administrative Team: Mr. Scott Herron President and CEO Mr. Herron graduated high school from NCC, and says that his appreciation for how NCC shaped his character and intellect is what inspired him to return to his Alma Mater as the school president.

Mr. Herron graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Economics from Huntington University in Indiana, and spent the subsequent years in the United States where he became one of the executives with the American Red Cross as well as an international finance broker with Charles Schwab. Mr. Herron shares that one of the most rewarding parts of his job at NCC is being able to interact with students—on student camping trips, at student athletic competitions, or just over dinner together in the dining hall. Mr. Herron says, “It is my privilege to be able to help the students of NCC realize the incredible plan that God has for each of their lives. All of us at NCC take very seriously our role in helping our students reach their potential.” Mr. Chris Baird Principal Mr. Baird graduated from McMaster University with an Honours major in English and before obtaining his Bachelor of Education degree from Redeemer University.

Ms. Bailey teaches Geography at NCC. Over the years, she coordinated the library and learning commons programming, and has coached a variety of sports, including middle school basketball and volleyball, and high school basketball, volleyball, cheerleading, and softball. Ms. Bailey shares that she has a particular appreciation for the value of smaller, private Christian institutions like NCC due to having experienced as a student the “exact opposite” as she attended a very large, public high school in California. She shares that she felt “lost in secular education” and is thrilled to be a part of NCC. “Many years ago I knew God was calling me to teach English in a foreign country,” she says. ”I did not know it was going to be Canada, but He was faithful to fulfill the calling in my life.” Ms. Michele Barlow Resource Teacher Ms. Barlow has been with NCC since 2011 working as a Resource Teacher for both middle school and high school.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home»Support NCC»Alumni Dr. Henry Regier January 2018 UPDATE: Dr. Regier recently received an honorary doctorate of science from Michigan State University! Read more at: http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/pioneering-businesswoman-apple-exec-to-speak-at-commencement/ ****** After reading Jessica Dieleman's article, ""We Dig Archaeology"" in the previous edition of the Collegian, Dr. Henry Regier ('48) contacted NCC to see if he could be of service to our students. He offered to present a lecture and hold subsequent discussions with our students regarding Great Lakes rehabilitation, or the likely effects of climate change - subjects which reflect his fascinating career in these fields. Needless to say, we were absolutely delighted and honoured to hear from him. As editor of the Collegian, I am constantly on the hunt for stories about our alumni. Dr. Regier's offer to serve provided an opportunity to ask permission to write a piece about him, and to dig into the archives for more about this '48 grad. Like so many of our alumni, Dr. Regier's request was that an article would not focus on him, preferring instead to serve as a ""navigational aid and not the message."" He wished to steer the discussion toward challenging our students in their environmental studies and how NCC is assisting them in that field. He sent along a fascinating and thought-provoking essay to pique the students' interest and to suggest a possible alternative theme for the Collegian write-up. In response to his essay, I will be following up with that article in the coming months. Before that article is written, however, I want to reflect on the impact that alumni like Dr. Regier have on our world. His leadership in the field of environmental stewardship serves as an immense inspiration and example to our students and the rest of our NCC community. Our hope as educators is that our students aspire towards the same excellence and take advantage of every opportunity for service in their chosen fields - and become world changers. Therefore, Dr. Regier's request was unapologetically overridden in order that his example may challenge us to pursue our own unique role as stewards of God's creation. Some highlights of Dr. Regier's distinguished career include serving as the Director of the Institute for Environmental Studies from 1989-1994, and as Professor in the Department of Zoology from 1966-1995 at the University of Toronto. Regier's contributions in the field of environmental stewardship have garnered public recognition and numerous awards. In 2009, Regier was named a Member of the Order of Canada, recognized for his outstanding achievements: ""A steward of the environment for more than 30 years, Henry Regier has contributed to the protection and restoration of the Great Lakes. Professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, he has studied the dynamics of fish populations and the rehabilitation of degraded aquatic ecosystems. Working with various Great Lakes agencies and institutions, he spearheaded the development and implementation of ecosystem management strategies for these large lake watersheds and their resources. A leader in sustainable development, he has been widely sought after as a consultant by provincial, national and international organizations and governments."" Governor General Archives In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was the co-winner of a Nobel Peace Prize for responsible documentation of the risks of climate change. Dr. Regier served as a lead author of one of many reports crafted by international teams of expert scientists that contributed to that award. Regier has certainly lived up to his principles: ""When talking to Mennonites and BIC friends about my professional work, I emphasize that my personal ethical praxis has been consistent with that of the five-hundred-year legacy of our Plautdietsche Mennisten. Like my ancestors in general, I’m a pragmatic Christian; the Walk is a more reliable indicator than the Talk."" That being said, Dr. Henry Regier's ""walk"" continues to serve as a very reliable navigational aid for students, educators, and citizens whose mission is to make a difference. My hope is that we can emulate that same commitment and faithfulness to our own unique callings. Eco Aspirations For students who are pursuing higher education and have an interest in the environment and ecology, and perhaps want to further explore ekistics - the science of human settlements - or environmental economics…For those who want to combat global climate change, or to champion the preservation of endangered species, or to support the re-empowerment of Aboriginal Peoples in nature conservancy… Whatever your field of interest, you’ll be intrigued by his work, achievements, and awards, and no doubt inspired by the man himself. Regier’s multi-disciplinary approach, his leadership in the field of environmental stewardship, and his influence on power-brokers and political decision-makers is sure to impress. In addition to the Order of Canada, and Regier’s participation with the intergovernmental panel which led to a Nobel Peace Prize, other accomplishments have also been recognized. These are just a few: Conservation Award of the Federation of Ontario Naturalists, 1980 Centenary Medal by the Royal Society of Canada, 1986 Award of Excellence of the American Fisheries Society, 1992 Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association of Great Lakes Research, 2005 Read what colleagues at the University of Toronto’s School of the Environment had to say in tribute to Dr. Regier. The Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management Society (AEHMS) also organized a special tribute symposium at the 53rd Annual International Association for Great Lakes Research (IAGLR) Conference (18 May 2019) to honour Dr. Henry Regier. In 1968, Henry Regier convened a “Teach-in” with colleagues at the University of Toronto on the issue of Human Population. This was a pivotal time in history, when counter-cultural movements were rapidly effecting change throughout North America. Age-old paradigms were crumbling, and both church and state were at odds over various issues of civil rights, gender equality, reproductive rights, etc. Regier’s resulting publication “Exploding Humanity - The Crisis of Numbers” documented this series of events. Although retired, Dr. Regier remains active on issues relevant to environmental causes. For more information on Henry Regier, check out his Curriculum Vitae.

Our team is a dedicated group of professionals that work tirelessly to ensure all of our students are well taken care of. Your child will know he or she can always go to the administrative staff with questions and for help with day-to-day life on campus. Meet our Administrative Team: Mr. Scott Herron President and CEO Mr. Herron graduated high school from NCC, and says that his appreciation for how NCC shaped his character and intellect is what inspired him to return to his Alma Mater as the school president. Mr. Herron has served at NCC since 2009, and feels tremendously blessed to be able to work alongside the talented staff of NCC as well as the student body, parents of students, and the community at large. Mr. Herron graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Economics from Huntington University in Indiana, and spent the subsequent years in the United States where he became one of the executives with the American Red Cross as well as an international finance broker with Charles Schwab. Mr. Herron shares that one of the most rewarding parts of his job at NCC is being able to interact with students—on student camping trips, at student athletic competitions, or just over dinner together in the dining hall. Mr. Herron says, “It is my privilege to be able to help the students of NCC realize the incredible plan that God has for each of their lives.

Read more at: http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/pioneering-businesswoman-apple-exec-to-speak-at-commencement/ ****** After reading Jessica Dieleman's article, ""We Dig Archaeology"" in the previous edition of the Collegian, Dr. Henry Regier ('48) contacted NCC to see if he could be of service to our students. He offered to present a lecture and hold subsequent discussions with our students regarding Great Lakes rehabilitation, or the likely effects of climate change - subjects which reflect his fascinating career in these fields. Needless to say, we were absolutely delighted and honoured to hear from him. As editor of the Collegian, I am constantly on the hunt for stories about our alumni. Dr. Regier's offer to serve provided an opportunity to ask permission to write a piece about him, and to dig into the archives for more about this '48 grad. Like so many of our alumni, Dr. Regier's request was that an article would not focus on him, preferring instead to serve as a ""navigational aid and not the message."" He wished to steer the discussion toward challenging our students in their environmental studies and how NCC is assisting them in that field. He sent along a fascinating and thought-provoking essay to pique the students' interest and to suggest a possible alternative theme for the Collegian write-up. In response to his essay, I will be following up with that article in the coming months. Before that article is written, however, I want to reflect on the impact that alumni like Dr. Regier have on our world. His leadership in the field of environmental stewardship serves as an immense inspiration and example to our students and the rest of our NCC community. Our hope as educators is that our students aspire towards the same excellence and take advantage of every opportunity for service in their chosen fields - and become world changers. Therefore, Dr. Regier's request was unapologetically overridden in order that his example may challenge us to pursue our own unique role as stewards of God's creation. Some highlights of Dr. Regier's distinguished career include serving as the Director of the Institute for Environmental Studies from 1989-1994, and as Professor in the Department of Zoology from 1966-1995 at the University of Toronto. Regier's contributions in the field of environmental stewardship have garnered public recognition and numerous awards. In 2009, Regier was named a Member of the Order of Canada, recognized for his outstanding achievements: ""A steward of the environment for more than 30 years, Henry Regier has contributed to the protection and restoration of the Great Lakes. Professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, he has studied the dynamics of fish populations and the rehabilitation of degraded aquatic ecosystems. Working with various Great Lakes agencies and institutions, he spearheaded the development and implementation of ecosystem management strategies for these large lake watersheds and their resources. A leader in sustainable development, he has been widely sought after as a consultant by provincial, national and international organizations and governments."" Governor General Archives In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was the co-winner of a Nobel Peace Prize for responsible documentation of the risks of climate change. Dr. Regier served as a lead author of one of many reports crafted by international teams of expert scientists that contributed to that award. Regier has certainly lived up to his principles: ""When talking to Mennonites and BIC friends about my professional work, I emphasize that my personal ethical praxis has been consistent with that of the five-hundred-year legacy of our Plautdietsche Mennisten. Like my ancestors in general, I’m a pragmatic Christian; the Walk is a more reliable indicator than the Talk."" That being said, Dr. Henry Regier's ""walk"" continues to serve as a very reliable navigational aid for students, educators, and citizens whose mission is to make a difference. My hope is that we can emulate that same commitment and faithfulness to our own unique callings. Eco Aspirations For students who are pursuing higher education and have an interest in the environment and ecology, and perhaps want to further explore ekistics - the science of human settlements - or environmental economics…For those who want to combat global climate change, or to champion the preservation of endangered species, or to support the re-empowerment of Aboriginal Peoples in nature conservancy… Whatever your field of interest, you’ll be intrigued by his work, achievements, and awards, and no doubt inspired by the man himself. Regier’s multi-disciplinary approach, his leadership in the field of environmental stewardship, and his influence on power-brokers and political decision-makers is sure to impress. In addition to the Order of Canada, and Regier’s participation with the intergovernmental panel which led to a Nobel Peace Prize, other accomplishments have also been recognized. These are just a few: Conservation Award of the Federation of Ontario Naturalists, 1980 Centenary Medal by the Royal Society of Canada, 1986 Award of Excellence of the American Fisheries Society, 1992 Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association of Great Lakes Research, 2005 Read what colleagues at the University of Toronto’s School of the Environment had to say in tribute to Dr. Regier. The Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management Society (AEHMS) also organized a special tribute symposium at the 53rd Annual International Association for Great Lakes Research (IAGLR) Conference (18 May 2019) to honour Dr. Henry Regier. In 1968, Henry Regier convened a “Teach-in” with colleagues at the University of Toronto on the issue of Human Population. This was a pivotal time in history, when counter-cultural movements were rapidly effecting change throughout North America. Age-old paradigms were crumbling, and both church and state were at odds over various issues of civil rights, gender equality, reproductive rights, etc. Regier’s resulting publication “Exploding Humanity - The Crisis of Numbers” documented this series of events. Although retired, Dr. Regier remains active on issues relevant to environmental causes. For more information on Henry Regier, check out his Curriculum Vitae.

She holds professional certificates as Nutrition Manager, Executive Housekeeping, and Registered Laundry and Linen Director. Since coming to NCC, Ms. Lovegrove has become a certified trainer of food safety for TrainCan Inc, which has allowed her to train and certify NCC staff along with employees from other agencies outside of NCC. She shares that her business trip to Hong Kong in 2012 was a significant step in her desire to learn more about foods from every country represented on the NCC campus. Her love for NCC students keeps her motivated and energized at work. She finds working with students from other cultures from around the world interesting and rewarding. During the school year she fills the roles of being a parent, guidance counsellor, and employer to many students - but most of all, their friend. Ms. Lovegrove is a Canadian-born Aboriginal, from the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (MNCFN) reserve, near Brantford, Ontario.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Schedule a Tour Campus Tour You are here Home Important Announcement Re: NCC Campus Closure March 17, 2020 Dear Parents of Boarding Students, Yesterday we sent a communication recommending that all students leave campus; this morning, Premier Doug Ford formally declared a state of emergency for Ontario due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary. We understand that travelling home might restrict students from travelling back to Canada should schools open, and we commit to educating your child at home regardless. As we have said in the previous correspondence, given our commitment to online learning and our teachers’ commitment to individual student support through the online environment, we are confident that your child can engage in the learning process whether they are at home with family, or staying with a family-friend or relative in the area. Though NCC cannot commit to providing any long-term homestay accommodations, we know that these are challenging times for parents and for students, and we will work tirelessly until we know that each child is safely at home or with an appropriate family-friend or relative. We are committed to ongoing communication with parents and students as the situation unfolds and we continue to trust in God’s sovereignty and provision. Please continue to reach out to us with questions and concerns as you make the necessary plans for your child’s departure over the next days.

Effective immediately “all private schools as defined in the Education Act are legally required to close”. In compliance with this governmental order, NCC will be closing the campus until March 31st and, of course, longer if otherwise instructed. For the detailed news release, please see the following link. Before today, we had also advised against off-campus travel; now we are requiring that all students currently off-campus do not return until notified by the school that operations have resumed and they are safe to do so. We are also requiring that all students currently on campus make arrangements to leave within the next 48 hours. Parents who have not yet emailed the school detailing when their child will leave or where they will be staying for the duration of the campus closure are asked to do so by emailing the appropriate Dorm Director (for girls, [email protected]; for boys, [email protected]). If you have questions about storage or picking up belongings, please include those in your email and the Dorm Director will reply to you in this regard as soon as they can. These are unprecedented times and we believe that the safest and best place for your child is at home with you. We understand the complicated decision-making process posed to parents as they consider what place is best for their child. For this reason, we have committed to delivering a high-level online education to each student regardless of changes in timezone, country, and context from March 23 until the end of the school year, if necessary.
