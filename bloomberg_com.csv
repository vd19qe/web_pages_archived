By Simon Kennedy @simonjkennedy More stories by Simon Kennedy May 18, 2020, 12:01 AM EDT Updated on May 18, 2020, 11:57 AM EDT From SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email When Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff published their heavyweight history of financial crises in late 2009, the title was ironic. This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly reminded readers that the catastrophic 2008-09 credit crisis was far from unique. The authors became the go-to experts on the history of government defaults, recessions, bank runs, currency sell-offs, and inflationary spikes. Everything seemed to be part of a predictable pattern. And yet a little more than a decade later, we’re experiencing what appears to be a one-of-a-kind crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic has catapulted the world into its deepest recession since the Great Depression, provoking an unprecedented fiscal and monetary response. The International Monetary Fund is already warning that the outlook has deteriorated since it predicted in April that the world economy would shrink 3% this year. To figure out what might be next, Bloomberg Markets spoke to Reinhart, a former deputy director at the IMF who’s now a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, and Rogoff, a former IMF chief economist who’s now a professor at Harvard. It turns out this time really is different. BLOOMBERG MARKETS: How are you faring during the lockdown? CARMEN REINHART: My husband and I are among the lucky ones because we can work from home. We came to Florida, where we’ve had a house for a decade. Our son lives in this area. Vincent’s brother lives in this area. So we wanted to be close to family. It’s a very busy period even though you’re always at home. Reinhart Illustrator: Marta Zafra for Bloomberg Markets KENNETH ROGOFF: I’m with my wife and 21-year-old daughter in our house in Cambridge, quarantining, so to speak. It’s been a very intense period partly because I was teaching a lot. And there was the shift to Zoom, which created more work because you’re trying to prepare differently and do your lectures differently. It’s obviously a surreal experience overall. BM: I will start with the clichéd question. Is this time different? CR: Yes. Obviously there are a lot of references to the influenza pandemic of 1918, which, of course, was the deadliest with estimated worldwide deaths around 50 million—maybe, by some estimates, as many as 100 million. So pandemics are not new. But the policy response to pandemics that we’re seeing is definitely new. If you look at the year 1918, when deaths in the U.S. during the Spanish influenza pandemic peaked, that’s 675,000. Real GDP that year grew 9%. So the dominant economic model at the time was war production. You really can’t use that experience as any template for this. That’s one difference. It’s certainly different from prior pandemics in terms of the economy, the policy response, the shutdown. The other thing that I like to highlight that is very different is how sudden this has been. If you look at U.S. unemployment claims in six weeks, we’ve had [job losses that] took 60 weeks in terms of the run-up. If you look at capital flows to emerging markets, the same story. The reversal in capital flows in the four weeks ending in March matched the decline during the [2008-09] global financial crisis, which took a year. So the abruptness and the widespread shutdowns we had not seen before. KR: Certainly the global nature of it is different and this highlights the speed. We have the first global recession crisis really since the Great Depression. In 2008 it was the rich countries and not the emerging markets. They [the emerging markets] had a “good” crisis in 2008, but they’re not going to this time, regardless of how the virus hits them. Rogoff Illustrator: Marta Zafra for Bloomberg Markets The policy response is also different. Think about China. Can you imagine if this had hit 50 years ago? Can you imagine the Chinese state having the capacity to shut down Hubei province? To feed nearly 60 million people, give them food and water and concentrate medical attention? So there is a policy option that we have and I think most countries have. It’s the choice that had to be taken to try to protect ourselves. Obviously, this has been done to differing degrees of effectiveness in different countries, with Asia reacting much quicker and with much better near-term outcomes than Europe and the U.S. BM: How do you regard the economic policy response? KR: It’s a little bit as if you were in a war and saying, “I’m not going to grade how you’re doing on the battlefield. I’m just going to grade how you’re hiring extra workers at home.” Obviously how you’re doing on the battlefield is driving everything. The economic policy response has been massive and absolutely necessary. You can quibble between the European style of trying to preserve firms and workers in their current jobs and the U.S. version, which is to try to address it as a natural catastrophe and try to subsidize people but allow higher unemployment. They’re actually not that different. If this thing persists, a lot of those European firms will end up having to let their workers go when the crisis passes. Some of the U.S. firms will end up rehiring their workers. But certainly the aggressive crisis response reflects lessons learned in 2008. “I don’t know how long it’s going to take us to get back to the 2019 per capita GDP. I would say, looking at it now, five years would seem like a good outcome” BM: Does that explain the stock market surge, which seems at odds with the state of the economy? CR: How much of the resilience, if not ebullience, in the market is policy driven? I think a lot of it. Let’s take monetary policy before the pandemic. U.S. unemployment was at its lowest level since the 1960s. By most metrics the U.S. was at or near full employment. It’s very possible that the path was toward rising interest rates. Clearly that has been completely replaced by a view that rates are zero now and that they’re going to stay low for a very long, long, indeterminate period of time, with a lot of liquidity support from the Federal Reserve. So that’s a big game changer, discounting futures. Let me just point out another issue in terms of the policy response. The Fed has established a lot of facilities that are now providing support not only to corporates, but to the fallen angels, the riskier corporates that certainly were not envisioned at the outset of the pandemic. What this does mean is that the market is really counting on a lot of rescues. The blanket coverage by the Fed is broad, and that is driving the market. And expectations are that we’re going to have this nice V-shaped recovery and life is going to return to normal as we knew it before the pandemic. And my own view is that neither of those are likely to be true. The recovery is unlikely to be V-shaped, and we’re unlikely to return to the pre-pandemic world. Although I do think that that’s part of the reason why we see this incongruence between the economic numbers and what the market is doing. KR: Of course, the “Fed lower forever” is part of it. I also feel the markets have a very sanguine view of the virus and what’s going to happen and how quickly we can return to normal or maybe how quickly we will choose to return to whatever normal is. It seems very uncertain to me. I don’t know how we’re coming back to 2019 levels [in the economy] in any near term. The true fall in GDP, economic historians will debate for years. It’s probably much larger than the measured fall. It’s not just the people not working. What’s the efficiency of the people who are working? The monetary response has been done hand in hand with the Treasury. The market is banking on this V-shaped recovery. But a lot of the firms aren’t coming back. I think we’re going to see a lot of work for bankruptcy lawyers going across a lot of industries. Uncharted Territory Change in real gross domestic product 2020 figures are forecasts. Source: International Monetary Fund BM: So what does the economic recovery look like? CR: There is talk on whether it’s going to be a W-shape if there’s a second wave and so on. That’s a very real possibility given past pandemics and if there’s no vaccine. One thing that’s clear is the numbers are going to look spectacularly great in some months simply because you’re coming out from a base that was pretty devastated. That doesn’t imply that per capita incomes are going to go back in V-shape to what they were before. The shock has disrupted supply chains globally and trade big-time. The World Trade Organization tells you trade can decline anywhere between 13% and 32%. I don’t think you just break and re-create supply chains at the drop of a hat. There are a lot of geographic changes that are being necessitated because, if the economic downturn has been synchronous, the disease itself hasn’t been synchronous. Another reason I think the V-shape story is dubious is that we’re all living in economies that have a hugely important service component. How do we know which retailers are going to come back? Which restaurants are going to come back? Cinemas? When this crisis began to morph from a medical problem into a financial crisis, then it was clear we were going to have more hysteresis, longer-lived effects. KR: In our book, Carmen and I use the definition of recovery as going back to the same income as the beginning. That, by the way, is really not the Wall Street definition of recovery, where recovery is going back to where the trend was. So we use a much more modest version of recovery. And still, with postwar financial crises before 2008-09, the average was four years, and for the Great Depression, 10 years. And there are many ways this feels more like the Great Depression. And you want to talk about a negative productivity shock, too. The biggest positive productivity shock we’ve had over the last 40 years has been globalization together with technology. And I think if you take away the globalization, you probably take away some of the technology. So that affects not just trade, but movements and people. And then there are the socio-political ramifications. I liken the incident we’re in to The Wizard of Oz, where Dorothy got sucked up in the tornado with her house, and it’s spinning around, and you don’t know where it will come down. That’s where our social, political, economic system is at the moment. There’s a lot of uncertainty, and it’s probably not in the pro-growth direction. Also you probably need a debt moratorium that’s fairly widespread for emerging markets and developing economies. As an analogy, the IMF or Chapter 11 bankruptcy is very good at dealing with a couple of countries or a couple of firms at a time. But just as the hospitals can’t handle all the Covid-19 patients showing up in the same week, neither can our bankruptcy system and neither can the international financial institutions. So there are going to be phenomenal frictions coming out of this wave of bankruptcies, defaults. It’s probably going to be, at best, a U-shaped recovery. And I don’t know how long it’s going to take us to get back to the 2019 per capita GDP. I would say, looking at it now, five years would seem like a good outcome out of this. “If it drags on, the forces that are pulling the euro zone apart are going to grow stronger and stronger.” BM: I’d like to focus on the debt issue. The Group of 20 has already agreed to freeze bilateral government loan repayments for low-income nations until the end of 2020. How else do we deal with what developing and emerging economies owe? CR: The problem in emerging markets goes beyond the poorest countries. For many emerging markets, we’ve also had a massive, massive oil shock. Nigeria, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico—they’ve all been downgraded. So the hit to emerging markets is just very broad. Nigeria is in terrible shape. South Africa is in terrible shape. Turkey is in terrible shape. Ecuador already is in default status, as well as Argentina. These are big emerging markets. It’s going to be enormously costly. For the G-20 initiative, I indeed hope it is the G-20 and not just the G-19. China needs to be on board with debt relief. That’s a big issue. The largest official creditor by far is China. If China is not fully on board on granting debt relief, then the initiative is going to offer little or no relief. If the savings are just going to be used to repay debts to China, well, that would be a tragedy. We’ve not mentioned Italy, and that brings us to the euro zone. This is very, very destructive within the euro zone. If it drags on, the forces that are pulling the euro zone apart are going to grow stronger and stronger. BM: What is the appetite at the IMF for coming to the rescue? KR: The IMF at this point is all-in on trying to find a debt moratorium, recognizing there’s going to be restructuring in a lot of places. But I don’t think the U.S. is by any means all-in, and a lot of the contracts of the private sector are governed under U.S. law. And if the U.S. government is not in, if China’s not in, it’s not really enough. But it’s far easier to go the route of the G-20. If the G-20 says it’s in the global interest that debt moratoria be widely respected by all creditors for the next year, then that carries a lot of force, even in U.S. courts. But if they don’t say that, and every country’s left on its own to work something out, I think we get back to my Covid-19 hospital analogy where the system just gets overwhelmed. The Fear Issue Illustrator: Lauren Tamaki BM: What about the debts in the major economies, given they have been run up so aggressively? KR: It’s not a free lunch, but there was no choice. This is like war. There is no debate that they should be doing all they can to try to maintain political and social cohesion, to maintain economies. But what lies at the other end? I go back to my Wizard of Oz analogy. The financial markets think there’s no chance interest rates will go up. There is no chance inflation will go up. If they’re right, and if another shoe doesn’t drop, it’ll be fine. But we could have costs from this. We’re talking about economies shrinking by 25% to 30%. And those [declines] are just staggering compared to the debt burden costs, whatever they are. So certainly we would strongly endorse doing what governments are doing. But selling it as a free lunch, that’s stupefyingly naive. CR: I actually wanted to go back to the Italy issue. If you look back to 2008-09, nearly everybody had a banking crisis. But a couple of years later, the focus had moved from the banking problem to the debt problem. And it was the peripheral Europe debt problem with Portugal, Ireland, Iceland—most notoriously Greece—having the largest, by a huge margin, IMF programs in history. I would point out that Greece, Ireland, and Portugal combined are a little over a third of Italian GDP. And if there’s a shakeout that involves concerns about Italy’s growth, then we could have a transition again from the focus on the Covid-19 crisis this time to a debt crisis. But Italy, as I said, is on a different scale than the peripheral countries that got into the biggest trouble in the last crisis. It potentially also envelops Spain. So I think that if you were to ask me about an advanced economy debt issue, I think that is where it is most at the forefront. KR: We argued at the time that the right recipe was to involve writedowns of the southern European debts. And I think that would have been cheap money in terms of restoring growth in the euro zone and would have [been] paid back. And we may be at that same juncture in another couple of years where you’re looking at just staggering austerity in Spain and Italy on top of a period of staggering hardship. Advanced countries have done this all the time—finding some sort of debt restructuring or writedown to give them fiscal space again, to support growth again. If the euro zone doesn’t find a way to deal with this, maybe eurobonds might be in the picture to try to indirectly provide support. Again, we’re going to see huge forces pulling apart the euro zone. BM: What about China, which also has leverage challenges? CR: Chinese growth has always been very outward-looking, very propelled by export-led growth. You’ve also had much of its double-digit growth come from incredible fixed investment. So I think the settling point for Chinese growth is going to be well below 6%. I’m not saying they’re not going to have a rebound after the more than 20% crash at the beginning of this year. But I’m saying that then your settling point is going to be lower than 6%. And part of the story is debt. It’s hard to say in China what is public and what is private, but corporates in China levered up significantly, expecting that they were going to continue to grow at double digits forever. That hasn’t materialized. There’s overcapacity in a lot of industries. China came into this with inflation running over 5% because of the huge spike in pork prices. So I think initially that the PBOC [People’s Bank of China] has been somewhat constrained initially in doing their usual big credit stimulus by uncertainty over their inflation. I think that’s changing because of the collapse in oil price. So I do think we are going to see more stimulus from China. KR: There will be a pretty sustained growth slowdown in China. We were on track for that anyway. But who can they export to? The rest of the world is going to be in recession. I think if they can average 1% growth the next two, three years, then that will look good. That’s not a bad prediction for China. And let’s remember, their population dynamic is completely changing. So 3% growth in that, with that Europeanizing of their population dynamics, would not be bad at all. But there’s a big-picture question about their huge centralization, which is clearly an advantage in dealing with the national crisis but maybe doesn’t provide the flexibility over the long term to get the dynamism that at least you’ve got in the U.S. economy. BM: How does central banking change worldwide? Do we see that blurring of lines with fiscal policy? KR: It’s fiscal policy that they’re doing in this emergency situation. You can’t imagine trying to get these same subsidies passed through the Senate and the House in real time. So central banks all over the world are using the fiscal side of their balance sheet. A lot of people don’t properly understand that governments own the central banks. And when the central bank uses its balance sheet, it’s acting as an agent on behalf of the government, whether it’s doing maturity transformation, which is what pure quantitative easing is, when it buys long-term debt, [or] it’s doing subsidies to the private sector by buying mortgages, by intervening in corporate debt, by intervening in municipals. Ultimately I hope we don’t see a big change in central banks, but we’re probably going to need an expansion in finance ministries to take on and regularize and legitimize some of these responsibilities. Lastly I think we’re not in a position to use deeply negative interest rates because the preparation hasn’t been done. And you have to deal with cash hoarding. That’s a shame because I think that would have been a valuable instrument, and would have been helpful for some municipals and corporates, and would have reduced the number of patients going into bankruptcy court. Monetary policy is essentially castrated by the zero bound. CR: Central banks were the arm of financing during two world wars, without question. I think you would have been laughed at if you really brought up the issue of central bank independence in the context of either world war. You really can’t separate the fiscal story and the debt story from the monetary story in extreme periods. Central banks began to do fiscal policy not just this time around, but they began to do fiscal policy in the 2008-09 crisis. We really can’t look independently at central banks without also looking at the balance sheet, not just of the government, but the balance sheet of the private sector, which has a lot of contingent liabilities. On the issue of negative interest rates, I do not share Ken’s views on that particular matter. When you have, as we do today, very fragmented markets, markets that became totally illiquid, I think the way I would deal with that would not be through making rates more negative, but by an approach closer to the one taken by the Fed, which is through a variety of facilities that provide directed credit. Sustained negative interest rates in Europe have led to a lot of bank disintermediation. And often bank disintermediation means that you end up with the less regulated, less desirable financial institutions. BM: There is some question over the future path of inflation. Do you see an inflationary surge at some point? KR: We don’t know where we will come out. So the probability is, for the foreseeable future, we’ll have deflation. But at the end of this, I think we’re going to have experienced an extremely negative productivity shock with deglobalization. In terms of growth and productivity, they will be lasting negative shocks, and demand may come back. And then you have the many forces that have led to very low inflation maybe going into reverse, either because of deglobalization or because workers will strengthen their rights. The market sees essentially zero chance of ever having inflation again. And I think that’s very wrong. BM: And what scars are left on economies once the pandemic passes? CR: Some of the scars are on supply chains. I don’t think we’ll return to their precrisis normal. We’re going to see a lot of risk aversion. We’ll be more inward-looking, self-sufficient in medical supplies, self-sufficient in food. If you look at some of the legacies of the big crises, those have all seen fixed investment ratchet down and often stay down. Kennedy is executive editor for Bloomberg Economics in London.

By Lisa Du and Grace Huang , May 22, 2020, 6:00 PM EDT Japan to end its state of emergency nationwide on Monday Success against the pathogen comes despite loose lockdown Japan Is Set to Lift State of Emergency for Tokyo SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email We're tracking the latest on the coronavirus outbreak and the global response. Sign up here for our daily newsletter on what you need to know. Japan’s state of emergency is set to end with new cases of the coronavirus dwindling to mere dozens. It got there despite largely ignoring the default playbook. No restrictions were placed on residents’ movements, and businesses from restaurants to hairdressers stayed open. No high-tech apps that tracked people’s movements were deployed. The country doesn’t have a center for disease control. And even as nations were exhorted to “test, test, test,” Japan has tested just 0.2% of its population -- one of the lowest rates among developed countries. Yet the curve has been flattened, with deaths well below 1,000, by far the fewest among the Group of Seven developed nations. In Tokyo, its dense center, cases have dropped to single digits on most days. While the possibility of a more severe second wave of infection is ever-present, Japan has entered and is set to leave its emergency in just weeks, with the status lifted already for most of the country and Tokyo and the remaining four other regions set to exit Monday . Analyzing just how Japan defied the odds and contained the virus while disregarding the playbook used by other successful countries has become a national conversation. Only one thing is agreed upon: that there was no silver bullet, no one factor that made the difference. “Just by looking at death numbers, you can say Japan was successful,” said Mikihito Tanaka, a professor at Waseda University specializing in science communication, and a member of a public advisory group of experts on the virus. “But even experts don’t know the reason.” Flattened After a peak in early April, new coronavirus cases in Japan have fallen below 50 a day Source: Japan Health Ministry One widely shared list assembled 43 possible reasons cited in media reports, ranging from a culture of mask-wearing and a famously low obesity rate to the relatively early decision to close schools. Among the more fanciful suggestions include a claim Japanese speakers emit fewer potentially virus-laden droplets when talking compared to other languages. Contact Tracing Experts consulted by Bloomberg News also suggested a myriad of factors that contributed to the outcome, and none could point to a singular policy package that could be replicated in other countries. Nonetheless, these measures still offer long-term lessons for countries in the middle of pandemic that may yet last for years. An early grassroots response to rising infections was crucial. While the central government has been criticized for its slow policy steps, experts praise the role of Japan’s contact tracers, which swung into action after the first infections were found in January. The fast response was enabled by one of Japan’s inbuilt advantages -- its public health centers, which in 2018 employed more than half of 50,000 public health nurses who are experienced in infection tracing. In normal times, these nurses would be tracking down more common infections such as influenza and tuberculosis. “It’s very analog -- it’s not an app-based system like Singapore,” said Kazuto Suzuki, a professor of public policy at Hokkaido University who has written about Japan’s response. “But nevertheless, it has been very useful.” While countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. are just beginning to hire and train contact tracers as they attempt to reopen their economies, Japan has been tracking the movement of the disease since the first handful of cases were found. These local experts focused on tackling so-called clusters, or groups of infections from a single location such as clubs or hospitals, to contain cases before they got out of control. “Many people say we don’t have a Centers for Disease Control in Japan,” said Yoko Tsukamoto, a professor of infection control at the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, citing a frequently held complaint about Japan’s infection management. “But the public health center is a kind of local CDC.” Burning Car A bus carrying Diamond Princess passengers leaves the port in Yokohama on Feb. 17. Photographer: Toru Hanai/Bloomberg The early response was also boosted by an unlikely happening. Japan’s battle with the virus first came to mainstream international attention with its much-criticized response to the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February that led to hundreds of infections. Still, the experience of the ship is credited with providing Japanese experts with invaluable data early in the crisis on how the virus spread, as well as catapulting it into the public consciousness. Other countries still saw the virus as someone else’s problem, said Tanaka. But in Japan, the international scrutiny over the infections onboard and the pace at which the virus raced throughout the ship raised awareness and recognition that the same can happen across the country, he said. “For Japan, it was like having a burning car right outside your house.” For more on Japan’s response to the virus: Japan to Lift Emergency in Tokyo on Monday, Reports Say Japan Welcomed Foreign Workers Then Left Them in Covid-19 Limbo Tokyo Mortality Data Shows No Jump in Deaths During Pandemic Tokyo Head Sees Olympics Canceled if Virus Isn’t Under Control Who’s Succeeding Against the Coronavirus and Why: QuickTake Although political leadership was criticized as lacking, that allowed doctors and medical experts to come to the fore -- typically seen as a best practice in managing public health emergencies. “You could say that Japan has had an expert-led approach, unlike other countries,” Tanaka said. Experts are also credited with creating an easy-to-understand message of avoiding what are called the “Three C’s” -- closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact settings -- rather than keeping away from others entirely. “Social distancing may work, but it doesn’t really help to continue normal social life,” said Hokkaido University’s Suzuki. “The ‘Three C’s’ are a much more pragmatic approach and very effective, while having a similar effect.” Different Strain Infectious disease experts also pointed to other determinants, with Shigeru Omi, the deputy head of the expert panel advising the Japanese government and a former chief of the WHO Western Pacific office, citing Japanese people’s health consciousness as possibly the most important factor. The possibility that the virus strain spreading in Japan may have been different, and less dangerous, to that faced by other nations, has also been raised. Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the U.S. studied coronavirus variants in a database and found one strain of the virus spreading through Europe that had several mutations distinguishing it from the Asian version, according to a paper put in early May. Although the study has not been peer-reviewed and drawn some criticism, the findings point to a need to more thoroughly study how the virus changes. Large questions still remain over the true extent of the pathogen’s spread. In April, a Tokyo hospital conducted tests on a handful of non-Covid patients and found that around 7% had the coronavirus, showing the danger of missing asymptomatic or mild carriers that can become the source of an outbreak. An antibody test on 500 people in the capital suggested the true outbreak could be nearly 20 times larger than figures have shown. Analog contact tracing breaks down when infection numbers are high, and reports of people unable to get tested or even medical treatment for Covid-like symptoms peppered social media during the height of the outbreak. And the fact remains that Japan’s response was less than perfect. While the overall population is much smaller, Asian neighbors such as Taiwan had just seven confirmed deaths from the virus, while Vietnam had none. “You can’t say the Japan response was amazing,” said Norio Sugaya, a visiting professor at Keio University’s School of Medicine in Tokyo and a member of a World Health Organization panel advising on pandemic influenza. “If you look at the other Asian countries, they all had a death rate that was about 1/100th of Western countries.” Buying Time Tsutenkaku tower in Osaka is lit up in green signaling the region has met its target to lift restrictions. Photographer: Buddhika Weerasinghe/Bloomberg While Japan may have avoided the worst of the health outcomes, the loose lockdown hasn’t protected the country from the economic impact. Its economy, already dealing with the impact of a sales tax hike in October, officially slid into recession in the first three months of the year. Economists have warned the second quarter will be the worst on record, and the specter of deflation, which haunted the economy for decades, once again looms. Tourist numbers plummeted 99.9% in April after the country shut its borders, putting the brakes on a booming industry that had promised to be a growth driver for years. As in other countries, bankruptcies have risen sharply. Even with the the state of emergency about to end, authorities are warning that life will not return to normal. When case numbers slowed in early March, there was public optimism that the worst was over -- only for cases to spike again and trigger the emergency declaration. If a deadlier second wave does follow, the risk factor in Japan, which has the world’s oldest population, remains high. The country has speedily approved Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and is now scrambling to allow the use of still unproven Fujifilm Holdings Corp.’s antiviral Avigan. There are calls for the country to use the time it has bought itself to shore up its testing and learn in the way its neighbors did from SARS and MERS. Officials have begun to speak of a phase in which people “live with the virus,” with a recognition that Japan’s approach has no possibility of wiping out the pathogen. “We have to assume that the second wave could be much worse than the first wave and prepare for it,” said Yoshihito Niki, a professor of infectious diseases at Showa University’s School of Medicine. “If the next explosion of cases is worse, the medical system will break down.” — With assistance by Gearoid Reidy, and Marika Katanuma Published on May 22, 2020, 6:00 PM EDT Updated on May 24, 2020, 8:38 PM EDT Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

By Lisa Du and Grace Huang , May 22, 2020, 6:00 PM EDT Japan to end its state of emergency nationwide on Monday Success against the pathogen comes despite loose lockdown Japan Is Set to Lift State of Emergency for Tokyo SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email We're tracking the latest on the coronavirus outbreak and the global response. Sign up here for our daily newsletter on what you need to know. Japan’s state of emergency is set to end with new cases of the coronavirus dwindling to mere dozens. It got there despite largely ignoring the default playbook. No restrictions were placed on residents’ movements, and businesses from restaurants to hairdressers stayed open. No high-tech apps that tracked people’s movements were deployed. The country doesn’t have a center for disease control. And even as nations were exhorted to “test, test, test,” Japan has tested just 0.2% of its population -- one of the lowest rates among developed countries. Yet the curve has been flattened, with deaths well below 1,000, by far the fewest among the Group of Seven developed nations. In Tokyo, its dense center, cases have dropped to single digits on most days. While the possibility of a more severe second wave of infection is ever-present, Japan has entered and is set to leave its emergency in just weeks, with the status lifted already for most of the country and Tokyo and the remaining four other regions set to exit Monday . Analyzing just how Japan defied the odds and contained the virus while disregarding the playbook used by other successful countries has become a national conversation. Only one thing is agreed upon: that there was no silver bullet, no one factor that made the difference. “Just by looking at death numbers, you can say Japan was successful,” said Mikihito Tanaka, a professor at Waseda University specializing in science communication, and a member of a public advisory group of experts on the virus. “But even experts don’t know the reason.” Flattened After a peak in early April, new coronavirus cases in Japan have fallen below 50 a day Source: Japan Health Ministry One widely shared list assembled 43 possible reasons cited in media reports, ranging from a culture of mask-wearing and a famously low obesity rate to the relatively early decision to close schools. Among the more fanciful suggestions include a claim Japanese speakers emit fewer potentially virus-laden droplets when talking compared to other languages. Contact Tracing Experts consulted by Bloomberg News also suggested a myriad of factors that contributed to the outcome, and none could point to a singular policy package that could be replicated in other countries. Nonetheless, these measures still offer long-term lessons for countries in the middle of pandemic that may yet last for years. An early grassroots response to rising infections was crucial. While the central government has been criticized for its slow policy steps, experts praise the role of Japan’s contact tracers, which swung into action after the first infections were found in January. The fast response was enabled by one of Japan’s inbuilt advantages -- its public health centers, which in 2018 employed more than half of 50,000 public health nurses who are experienced in infection tracing. In normal times, these nurses would be tracking down more common infections such as influenza and tuberculosis. “It’s very analog -- it’s not an app-based system like Singapore,” said Kazuto Suzuki, a professor of public policy at Hokkaido University who has written about Japan’s response. “But nevertheless, it has been very useful.” While countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. are just beginning to hire and train contact tracers as they attempt to reopen their economies, Japan has been tracking the movement of the disease since the first handful of cases were found. These local experts focused on tackling so-called clusters, or groups of infections from a single location such as clubs or hospitals, to contain cases before they got out of control. “Many people say we don’t have a Centers for Disease Control in Japan,” said Yoko Tsukamoto, a professor of infection control at the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, citing a frequently held complaint about Japan’s infection management. “But the public health center is a kind of local CDC.” Burning Car A bus carrying Diamond Princess passengers leaves the port in Yokohama on Feb. 17. Photographer: Toru Hanai/Bloomberg The early response was also boosted by an unlikely happening. Japan’s battle with the virus first came to mainstream international attention with its much-criticized response to the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February that led to hundreds of infections. Still, the experience of the ship is credited with providing Japanese experts with invaluable data early in the crisis on how the virus spread, as well as catapulting it into the public consciousness. Other countries still saw the virus as someone else’s problem, said Tanaka. But in Japan, the international scrutiny over the infections onboard and the pace at which the virus raced throughout the ship raised awareness and recognition that the same can happen across the country, he said. “For Japan, it was like having a burning car right outside your house.” For more on Japan’s response to the virus: Japan to Lift Emergency in Tokyo on Monday, Reports Say Japan Welcomed Foreign Workers Then Left Them in Covid-19 Limbo Tokyo Mortality Data Shows No Jump in Deaths During Pandemic Tokyo Head Sees Olympics Canceled if Virus Isn’t Under Control Who’s Succeeding Against the Coronavirus and Why: QuickTake Although political leadership was criticized as lacking, that allowed doctors and medical experts to come to the fore -- typically seen as a best practice in managing public health emergencies. “You could say that Japan has had an expert-led approach, unlike other countries,” Tanaka said.

By Laura Bliss and Jessica Lee Martin June 18, 2020, 8:00 AM Share Share Share Share Share Maps are used to explore the world, but they also offer exploration within their own boundaries. The writer Rebecca Solnit once said in an interview: “Maps invite us to locate ourselves in relation to whatever they show, to enter the labyrinth that is each map and to find our way out by grasping what is mapped.” Making maps of your own world can amplify that experience, because it asks you to sort out what you think, feel, see, hear, and even desire in a place. In April, CityLab asked readers to share homemade maps of their lives during the coronavirus pandemic. The more than 400 maps we received are so many windows into what people around the globe have experienced through this extraordinary crisis, as well as its sprawling social consequences. Diverse in style and content, yet deeply connected in their themes, the maps collectively show how coronavirus has transformed the places we live. Beloved people, places, and activities were suddenly out of reach. Food, shelter, and other basics were vested with elevated importance; so were access to nature, creative outlets, and a sense of social connection. Under pressure and confinement, relationships and perspectives turned hyperlocal — and, in many cases, were widened by a sense of injustice about who was dying, and who was not. By late May, economies began to reopen and communities re-revised their sense of normal. Rage over the systemic racism that also played into the pandemic’s unequal death toll reached a boiling point in the U.S. and erupted into global demonstrations. With protesters filling streets that were empty and quiet mere weeks before, neighborhoods are transforming once more — and hold promise for further transformation. We invite you to explore this published selection of reader-made maps, organized into six thematic sections that reflect some of the pandemic’s effects. “Domestic rearrangements” examines shifting home lives. “Psychic landscapes” probes the emotional toll. “Redefined boundaries” surveys changed perceptions of wider surroundings. “Virtual connections” looks at the dominance of digital time. “Natural callings” taps into the lure of greenery and wildlife. Each map is accompanied by the words of the mapmaker, edited for clarity and flow. Our goal was to present a selection of maps based on a diversity of geographies, experiences, and artistic style. We also invite you to participate in this project by sharing your own map of life in the era of coronavirus, reflecting on how these sweeping changes continue to shape your world. Go here to submit your map story and find more information. The deadline is Sunday, June 21. Sign up for CityLab MapLab, a biweekly newsletter about maps that reveal and shape urban spaces. × Sort See all Domestic rearrangements Psychic landscapes Redefined boundaries Virtual connections Natural callings Aditi Shah Berkeley, California Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/7/2020 While drawing this map, I felt increasingly curious about how my neighborhood evolved. I particularly loved drawing the looming redwoods and clashing architecture. While drawing my favorite businesses in the area, I took some artistic liberty with their roofs for fun. To be honest, I took artistic liberty with the whole map because I couldn’t remember the exact details of the buildings and their foliage. Even though this map isn’t accurate, looking at it makes me deeply appreciate the privilege of where I live during these strange times. Agustina Martire Buenos Aires, Argentina Category: Redefined boundaries 4/18/2020 The map is a collage of the lockdown in Buenos Aires, where we are only allowed to go out for groceries and pharmacies. The red line is my walk, every other day, to buy the basics. The room I drew is where my five-year-old daughter and I spend most of the day, working remotely and homeschooling. I normally live in Belfast, but visit Buenos Aires every year. Normally I would spend most of the day here outside the house, meeting people for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Now all the socializing happens by phone. The neighborhood is still quite lively, as this is a very dense area of the city, but facemasks are compulsory so there is an unusual sense of mistrust. A woman in the queue at the butcher said: “I am smiling behind the mask,” which made us both laugh. Alayna Delgado Tampa, Florida Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/7/2020 I’m in graduate school and I’m staying with my mom, dad, and four younger siblings until I can move out in early May. It’s hectic, to say the least! Things have changed: So much leisurely strolling and biking! Saving money by only going out for necessities! I’ve also really fallen in love with how cute Tampa bungalows are. I forgot! Alex Chung New York, New York Category: Redefined boundaries 4/17/2020 My neighborhood map shows the roughly four-to-five-block radius that I considered to be my neighborhood prior to Covid-19. I have shown my home, which now serves a function as a school, as well as a home gym. I’ve shown key landmarks, which, after drawing the map, I realized were primarily locations to purchase food and other necessities. From my map, I’ve realized that I am only leaving my home to gather these essential items, and as such, I am no longer able to enjoy the more casual, unique elements of my neighborhood that make it what it is. One of my favorite parts of my neighborhood is being close to everything. Now, I have become attuned to the fact that even with all of these places nearby, I find myself with nowhere to go. Alex Wang Cupertino, California Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/16/2020 For many Cupertino residents, Blackberry Farm park has become the natural place to stroll to help relieve the tension from the challenges that this pandemic has brought. Silicon Valley professionals who are often too caught up in the hustle and bustle of the dynamic tech industry now have time to say hi to neighbors and to really stop and smell the roses. This is a good opportunity to use the break from routine, to re-evaluate what really matters to us. Folks are now also tapping into dormant networks to reconnect with meaningful friendships, and also being forced to acknowledge who we would’ve liked to be quarantined with, and the reverse, for that matter. Amna Azeem Sialkot, Pakistan Category: Redefined boundaries 4/11/2020 I have mapped the places that are etched in my memories. Being raised in a neighborhood that is socially very active and is located in the heart of downtown with all the necessary facilities available nearby has enabled me to make unforgettable memories, a glimpse of which I have shown in the map. This sudden epidemic has made us realize the little things we took for granted. Coronavirus has no doubt changed our lives by making us stay indoors. I feel very nostalgic when I think about the activities that I used to do. For now, my relationship with the neighborhood is limited. An Trinh Haiphong, Vietnam Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/17/2020 I have been in quarantine ever since I got back home from college. I got out of an ambulance in front of my door, and for weeks now, the only two places I can go are my room or my garden. I grew up in this neighborhood and can draw it in my sleep, but during this period, I cannot even have a walk outside. Hence, I decided to draw my new “neighborhood.” I can name all the vegetables and plants in my garden, know exactly where they are, how big they are, how many fruits and flowers on a tree, etc. It has changed vastly, as I cannot go out at all. I know that the market is still open and my mother still goes there once in a while, but many things are closed. I can imagine things, but I don't actually know how they are right now. Annita Parish Montreal, Canada Category: Natural callings 5/7/2020 I have never had the chance to explore my neighborhood as I now do. It’s amazing, since it offers me an opportunity to look around attentively, particularly at the trees. Although I've never labelled myself a dendrophile, there is something novel in trees that has changed my senses with everyday walking. In addition to their diverse shapes, locations, types, and blossoms that reappeared quickly at this time of year, their hollows and gestures of falling caught my attention, like a story behind their emptiness. Arthur Beaubois-Jude Calais, France Category: Redefined boundaries 5/4/2020 I like maps, and I do maps as a freelancer — I'm a cartographe, as we say. In France, if you have no professional or emergency reasons to go out, you have to stay at home, or you can take a walk within a one-kilometer radius. Because I'm very bored, and because nobody needs my maps during these times, I've done a map of my authorized living perimeter, and indicated the places of interest inside this little world. The center of my world? My home! I'm usually a stay-at-home person. But now, I just want to get out of this perimeter. Augusto Javier León Peralta Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia Category: Natural callings 4/19/2020 Within the blink of an eye, Covid-19 has changed our habits, reducing our sphere of action. The map shows the way I make a “ring” around my neighborhood for going shopping and, if necessary, to the bank and then back home. There is no dangerous traffic, no disturbing noises, no pollution. We can even see some animals in the city that were not seen before. Birds sing, they come to our balconies, the streets look clean. Of course, I am speaking only of my small neighborhood ring. I think this situation will serve to wipe away old habits which maybe were not the right ones, in order to raise awareness about protecting our world and through this taking care of ourselves. Aurelie Knecht San Luis Potosi, Mexico Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/9/2020 I escaped London for my boyfriend’s family house, which has transformed into a microcosm of our lives. Doing work, studying, exercising daily, eating a lot of tacos, drinking agua de piña to forget about the heat, and trying to go out for walks and hikes as soon as we can is now our new daily routine. It is not easy to be enclosed in a house that is not mine, but it is full of love and new experiences. It has become a sort of bubble we only rarely escape, and that we are happy to escape. The neighboring shops are the new attractions, whereas before we used to ignore them. Axel Forrester St. Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, United Kingdom Category: Psychic landscapes 4/30/2020 We discovered a beautiful old canyon near our house that looks like a lost world. My husband has been doing research on the history of the area and discovered that it was sold to the local council at cost for the public to enjoy in 1933 by a man named Herbert Povey. I wanted to make a fancy map for my grandson to discover it too when this lockdown is over. We moved here in November and we've certainly been discovering every inch of it, walking it every day. We love being close to Alexandra Park and these lovely hills, but this hidden valley is our favorite. It even has several waterfalls. We call it the Lost World Trail. Blanca Juan García Madrid, Spain Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/15/2020 During lockdown, I've been mostly confined to my home. I have no dog, and I live alone. My walks to the supermarket have been every 10 days, more or less. Before the government loosened the rules, my home had become my neighborhood and world in general. But now I can go outside for a walk, and I've been exploring my neighborhood. I moved to this part of the city in September, and due to my work, I couldn't explore it as I can do now. I'm discovering new shops, looking at people, and walking through a wood that is near my house. I’ve been very grateful. Brennan Walters Lacombe, Louisiana Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/4/2020 Just a quick sketch of Lacombe. Most residents here live along a bayou that feeds into Lake Pontchartrain, but there is a small “downtown” near a bend on Highway 190. We’re fortunate that much of life here revolves around the bayou, and that’s still open. It’s easy to maintain a six-foot distance, but Lacombe is a small town and you miss those little conversations after work stopping in Bayou Adventure or Da Crab Trap. Brian Palmer Cape Town, South Africa Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/5/2020 My map is a spin on the low perspective, pictorial maps that are often used for tourism. Instead of focusing on downtown Cape Town, Table Mountain National Park, and the waterfront, I shifted the perspective to the areas that tourists typically miss, namely the Cape Flats. These communities are home to some of the most vulnerable neighborhoods in the city as well as the most critically endangered sand fynbos nature preserves. While plenty of well-written policy is on the books to protect these at-risk people and ecosystems, attention still flows in the same direction as the art and media of the city. This map, watercolored into the wee hours of the morning, is my way of shifting these values by changing how we look at the cityscape of beautiful Cape Town. C.X. Hua Cambridge, Massachusetts Category: Natural callings 4/13/2020 I drew a map of all the sounds I heard on a long walk through my neighborhood. My small neighborhood has become my entire world! So things that used to seem small now seem much bigger. Birds seem louder. I drew this map because I found myself listening more intently as I walked and forming new dictionaries of sound in my head. Candelaria Mas Pohmajevic New York, New York Category: Virtual connections 4/22/2020 This is a map of my spot at home every day. I'm an urban design student and being in many cities at the same time is usual for me. But this time is unique because I'm nowhere and everywhere all the time. That computer connects me to the outside world. The only reminder I get from where I am is the window to the right, a glimpse to the characteristic New York City fire-escape stairs and the beautiful and changing shadows in a quarantined spring. Carla Ximena Carrillo Quintanilla Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia Category: Psychic landscapes 4/20/2020 The map is based on a video game named Bomberman. Like in the game, we carry a weapon, in this case the Covid-19 virus, which can kill us. The map is based on the path I must follow to reach different supply points without being caught by the enemy porting the virus. For this reason, social distancing has become our shield in this game of life. (Translated from Spanish by Erick Ruiz de Chavez) Carol Hsiung Millburn, New Jersey Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/5/2020 I drew this sketch reflecting what I saw and encountered on my dog walk down my street in Millburn, New Jersey, on one of those perfect sunny afternoons on a weekend when “everyone” seemed to be out — six feet apart. It made me feel nostalgic, remembering when I was a kid when kids played on the streets and neighbors talked with each other. I have been living here for 15 years and never saw so many families out walking and biking together — I even saw my husband ride by. I do not take my neighbors and neighborhood for granted anymore. I feel so lucky for living here. Champ Turner Austin, Texas Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/19/2020 My map shows a mile-long route through my neighborhood that I travel frequently. There are dozens of possible paths, but I selected the three I take most often. I've become more aware of the geography of my neighborhood, both on a macro and micro scale. I've become cognizant of the layout of streets, locations of specific landmarks, and the tiny details in people's yards that reveal things about their lives. Claudia Canedo Velasco Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia Category: Psychic landscapes 4/8/2020 From my place of peace, I imagine that the southern trees absorb the virus that comes from the north. A lot has changed: We communicate more, we collaborate for food purchases and we are in solidarity with each other. Constance Brown New Haven, Connecticut Category: Psychic landscapes 5/17/2020 My apartment is located smack in the middle of the map; my New Haven perambulations radiate out from it. Behind the map I've depicted dawn and dusk from my east-facing window; perched on the edge of the corona-frame is a local songbird, the Yellow-throated Vireo. I work at home as a mapmaker, so my work life is the same. Aside from occasional socially-distanced walks with friends and telecommunication, my social life is suspended, and I miss it. I miss our local restaurants, and worry about their fates. I'm grateful for our neighborhood markets and wine stores, which have stayed open. Always a lively pedestrian neighborhood, East Rock is even livelier, with walkers and runners out all the time. I'm more conscious of nature, and the new soundscape, which birds dominate. Strange to think that less than two miles away, Yale New Haven Hospital is a battleground. Edda Ívarsdóttir Iceland Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/5/2020 My map shows my house. After spending weeks staying at home working and learning there, it’s like our world has shrunk into it. Only leaving for running and occasional shopping. The city seems so quiet and tranquil, the birds and the cats seem to like it. All the cars are parked in the driveways, which is a nice change. We live close by a busy street and we feel there is a big difference in noise during rush hours. We see people going out more for biking and running than before. It’s overall a positive change. I hope we don’t go back to the way it was before, at least not all the way. Ele Denne Brussels, Belgium Category: Redefined boundaries 4/19/2020 This hibiscus flower, representing the blossoming trees here, is made up of the different bike routes I have taken over the past weeks around Brussels. In Brussels (the white area), the dominant language is French, but once you exit Brussels and enter Flanders (the surrounding pink area), everything is in Flemish Dutch. There are even some supermarkets from the Netherlands, with products that remind me of home. I also included some parks of the area to show the unequal spatial distribution of green spaces. This inequality became more acknowledged as an issue during the first weeks of quarantine, when the police sent someone who was taking a walk back to their neighborhood without many green spaces, even though there were no official distance limits. The size of my neighborhood is increasing and decreasing at the same time. It has decreased, because I have probably walked every single street around here right now, many of them full with blossoming cherry trees, and increased, because I have been biking in all possible directions to places I have never been before. Public transport is now only allowed for essential trips, but fortunately there is no distance limit on bike rides, and the streets are very calm, so I have been exploring the city and the countryside for the past weeks. Emily Benson Jackson, New Hampshire Category: Natural callings 5/2/2020 While we do not live in an urban setting, this map shows how ""busy"" our rural neighborhood is in the midst of the White Mountain National Forest. Staying at home during the height of the maple sugaring season in New Hampshire allowed us to have plenty of time to collect and process our maple sap, resulting in a record-breaking production of over 26 gallons of syrup this year. We have always been very close with our neighbors, which has proven to be a vital source of strength and support during these challenging times. Eric Hoke Nashville, Tennessee Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/13/2020 My map is focused around regular walking routes in our neighborhood. It shows the actual boundaries of Eastwood, a neighborhood within East Nashville, but the focus is the landmarks that my family has been frequently visiting during the pandemic. During recent walks, we have developed much better relationships with our neighbors because everyone is outside more. Esra Alim Samsun, Turkey Category: Psychic landscapes 5/28/2020 We are in quarantine nowadays, and this situation forces us to think about the mistakes we have made, our past and regrets. We are also thinking about our dreams, plans (travels, get-togethers, and so on). So I designed this mind map. I can travel to my past and future, with the help of this portal. Eva Spear Amsterdam, the Netherlands Category: Psychic landscapes 4/23/2020 I’ve retreated into my own world and drawn a map of the place I go to. My life has become more humane. More relaxed. It seems to me people tend to notice each other more, greet each other more. They seem more chilled out and interested in social contact, slowing down in the moment. Maybe I’m just speaking for myself. But the whole vibe sparks my creativity and lets my imagination run wild. Ezra Silkes San Diego, California Category: Redefined boundaries 4/7/2020 This is a map of the United States, as defined by where my friendships are. I just moved to San Diego, and have no attachment to it as a city. The cities I’m attached to are thousands of miles away from me, and I dearly miss the people in those cities. Quarantine has shrunk my world to just my house, but at the same time has reminded me that my world is much, much wider, and my connections span not only the country but the globe. Now, due to self-isolation, I will not have the chance to explore the neighborhood or surrounding areas. I will not get to know the people. I will stay inside and talk to the people I already know. As such, my neighborhood has grown to ignore all state borders and has become the people I loved before this crisis. Farah Makki Italy Category: Redefined boundaries 4/5/2020 I’ve been much more aware of the attractions and features around me and more appreciative of the available green areas. Francisca Benítez B. Brooklyn, New York Category: Redefined boundaries 4/24/2020 I yearn for my past places and communities. Now I walk more to the waterfront. By finding moments at home that mirror the outside world, the new routine could wash away the frustrations. Giannis Vlaxos Athens, Hlioupolis, Greece Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/24/2020 I live in a suburb of the prefecture of Attica in Greece. I stayed at home for more than two months — from March 11 until the end of May almost — avoiding contact and safely following only the necessary routes: 1 = home 2 = bakery 3 = supermarket 4 = newsstand 5 = church 6 = pharmacy I designed and edited this map on Google Earth. The coordinates and scale are accurate. Gro Slotsvik Bristol, United Kingdom Category: Psychic landscapes 4/19/2020 The author and illustrator Carson Ellis suggested drawing a “treasure map” as one of her daily Quarantine Art Club assignments and this was mine: a reminder to myself of what to do to stay happy during isolation. The mountains are based on the wonderful works of Christa Rijneveld and the sea monsters are from the Carta Marina (a brilliant 16th century map of the Nordic countries). My 11-month-old son also tried to help, by knocking over a cup of cold coffee onto the corner. Just in case you were wondering about the poor sea snake living in a darker bit of sea! Irene Palko Glasgow, Scotland Category: Redefined boundaries 4/29/2020 I arrived in Glasgow a few months ahead of the coronavirus pandemic at 63 years old, to a new home in a new city. It was also a totally new life: As the world shut down around me, I stared out of my window at the tree tops and the rain, afraid and disappointed. But I realized I was one of the lucky ones. The trees may be bare again before I can once more hug a friend or stranger, or simply stand next to another human being. In the meantime, the street will be my gallery, the park my theatre, and the world wide web my cafe, bar, and meeting place. Itzel Taboada Bolivia Category: Psychic landscapes 4/19/2020 This is the sunset that I see from my window, and the fresh air that only the virus gets to enjoy. Jackson S. Austin, Texas Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/18/2020 “This is a drawing about people who are finding ways to live positively during the lockdown. It's really weird that we're having to stay home for quite a long time. Everything is closed, we're not as busy as we once were. It's just an interesting time for all of us,” says Jackson about his map. Jackson has autism and I'm typing his thoughts for him. I'm his mom. James Hennessey Northern Ireland Category: Psychic landscapes 4/7/2020 More than ever, our little terraced house and garden have become a special sanctuary as we try to keep our family and those around us safe. On the one hand, [there is] an element of fear as we venture out for necessities, yet on the other, a heightened feeling of compassion with our neighbors and with strangers, as we jointly face this challenge. Jin Meiling Suzhou, China Category: Virtual connections 4/30/2020 My husband is German and I am Chinese. We met in Japan, and now are going through lockdown at our home in Suzhou, China. We both like cooking. Since lockdown started, we have cooked every day and I have learned several new dishes from different countries, as shown in my map. Sometimes, I get the cooking ideas from WeChat shared by friends and relatives. Chinese Guobaorou, a type of deep fried pork, is among them. It tastes good after several trials. But if I could choose, I would like to order in a restaurant. Joanna Chow Auckland, New Zealand Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/15/2020 We are in full lockdown for a minimum of four weeks. We have three adults working from home (and one more as an essential worker). Our entire neighborhood (or should I say world) has been shrunk down into just our home, and on the periphery are the nearest supermarket and our preferred walking routes around our home. Rather than waving and greeting each other as we leave and return home, we just wave to each other through the windows, if we happen to see each other. John Palumbi Baltimore, Maryland Category: Redefined boundaries 4/17/2020 This is a map of our cat’s nocturnal outdoor adventures during Covid-19. Ace is a 9-year-old indoor-outdoor cat who sometimes wears a collar with a GPS sports tracker. During the pandemic, he gets out a lot more than we do. As the map shows, we are experiencing our neighborhood through his eyes. Ace’s range is much larger than we would have ever imagined. He “patrols” alleys; snoops in people’s yards; pokes around near the waterfront; and (with fewer cars on the road) even crosses the street. While our personal “orbits” have severely contracted, our cat’s has enlarged. He walks a few miles around South Baltimore every night. Ace’s Adventure Map is something we look forward to each day as an antidote to our frustration and isolation. He still has the freedom to roam the city and we don't. We envy him. Jonas Vagnoux Bonneville, France Category: Redefined boundaries 4/16/2020 My map shows how my new relationship with space is transformed. The earth is not round anymore. I represented the single kilometer around my house where I can walk, run, ride my bike. Beyond this limit is the unknown. It is forbidden. I feel like I am in the Middle Ages, and I have to fight against a pioneer mindset that wants to explore what is beyond. Concerning time, my perception is also altered. We cannot spend more than one hour outside. So when I go for a walk, I savor every 3,600 seconds at my disposal. Justin Lini Washington, D.C. Category: Redefined boundaries 4/15/2020 My map shows how our view of the city has become oriented along the Anacostia River. Since social isolation began in March, my wife and I have been taking many walks around our neighborhood, but also to nearby Kenilworth Park. Normally people in the community don’t spend much time in Kenilworth Park. There’s not much in the way of things to do there, and it’s a little wild and overgrown. However, it has become an oasis to us in recent weeks, as it is a good way to go for a long stroll without running into a lot of people. One thing that I’ve really noticed, since I’m not driving and taking the metro everywhere, is that the natural and man-made barriers in the neighborhood have come to define the boundaries of this strange world. Justin Raymond Hernandez Miami Category: Psychic landscapes 4/18/2020 Like many people, quarantine has made me greatly miss seeing my friends and family. This got me thinking about how even under normal circumstances, I still remain physically distant from them because I don't have my own car. I created this fantasy transit map to highlight a hopeful future in which I'd be able to see them with ease and without having to drive. With no traffic and big-city rush, I've been able to bike around and appreciate the city’s green landscape and wonderful tropical weather. Often a community which comes across as being filled with self-obsessed individuals, I feel that Miami has always had issues with civic identity. But it has been wonderful seeing people supporting their neighbors at the moment. Karen Leu New York, New York Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/30/2020 Since New York has been on pause, I've been staying in my partner's studio. My world has shrunk but there has been a marked increase of legs in my living space. I miss my friends and family and being outside, but am grateful for sunlight and critters and comfort. I'm a relative newcomer to NYC. My car, which I'd drive every day before the lockdown, has been sitting in the same street spot. I'd adopted mask-wearing early and in the beginning would feel self-conscious going outside with one on. Now, those without are the ones being avoided. Kate Rutter Emeryville, California Category: Psychic landscapes 4/21/2020 Seeing nature up close and observing it with pen and paint is my most relaxing and rejuvenating activity. Usually I'm out in the world of nature. But now I must imagine my favorite places in my mind. This map was done in my home office as I captured some of my favorite nature spots from memory, starting at home and looking north. Each zone (home, neighborhood, town, and wilds) helped me revisit these places and appreciate them in a new way. Kayla Adolph Toledo, Ohio Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/21/2020 This map shows how our space changes by day and night based on our new routine. What once was just our living room is now a place of refuge at night when we're anxious. The neighborhood is both friendlier, scarier, and much smaller than it was before. We're becoming intimately aware of how interconnected the world is and it's intimidating at times. Kristi Lin San Diego, California Category: Virtual connections 4/14/2020 In my neighborhood, screens and windows open and close to different cities and countries. My neighborhood is vast yet cluttered, connected yet broken, behind my computer screen yet at the tip of my fingers. As a residential landscape designer, I am keenly aware of what my five senses can tell me about a neighborhood. Every site is unique, every place has a story. Working online has been difficult. Whereas I used to visiting neighborhoods that I design for in person, now I'm visiting them online, next to windows of breaking news. The visual bombardment has been overwhelming. A new neighborhood landscape of tabbed windows and collages of screen doors is taking shape. Lauren Nelson Arlington, Virginia Category: Redefined boundaries 4/11/2020 Now that public transit is closed except for essential travel, my wanderings are limited to walking and running within about a five-mile radius from my home. On foot, the Potomac River seems more pronounced as a physical barrier, separating Washington, D.C., from me in Arlington, Virginia. Although my neighborhood has always been walkable, the coronavirus emergency has changed my relationship to my neighborhood because most of the places I used to frequent are now closed. Having so many places close by and yet nowhere to go feels very paradoxical. Louis McNair Carlsbad, California Category: Psychic landscapes 5/15/2020 My map is interpretive of my feelings about our lockdown. It begins with my almost daily drive to work in a grocery store, shown in the thick black line. There are words, feelings, topics all over that represent what has gone through my mind during these times. As the words descend they go from color to black and grey, and the colorful neat words slowly transitions into grey messy words. María Liliana Solares Moreno Santa Cruz, Bolivia Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/19/2020 My map is about the difference between being at home and outside. Inside, we have the possibility to stay safe. But for this to happen, other people have to risk their lives — for example, police and doctors. They support our days in quarantine. In quarantine, I pay more attention to things like noises that are uncomfortable to me, such as kids screaming or the sounds of television. Marta Petteni Portland, Oregon Category: Psychic landscapes 4/26/2020 I am an Italian who has lived in Portland, Oregon, since 2017. My hometown, Bergamo, has been devastated by Covid-19, while in Portland, the situation is (or at least seems) better. My family and friends in Italy often share with me the ways that they are suffering from enclosure and the outdoors that they are missing. So I have started to more deeply enjoy the simple things of life, like reading under a tree, listening to the birds, or exploring my bizarre neighborhood. Often, while walking towards the park, I dream that I might turn the corner and find my Italian home there. It is a small yellow house with a grassy garden, an olive tree, and big windows. My parents are reading in the sun and my sister is waving at me, ready to join the walk. Even if the pandemic has made physical distances more painful, in my heart, my beloved worlds are even closer. Michele Tranquillini Milan, Italy Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/27/2020 During the quarantine I've felt gratitude for a lot of reasons every day, including having a safe and comfortable place to stay, loving people around me, a ukulele to play, and a tiny terrace with some plants. One day I decided to draw what I was seeing from my balcony — not exactly a map, but more a visual list or a postcard. I've felt a strong sense of connection to my neighbors: Singing, smiling, chatting, exchanging food (we are Italians!) from our windows and balconies was (and is) so important. As we rediscover a sense of community, I hope we won't forget what we've learned in these difficult days. Nawaf Al Mushayt Lisbon, Portugal Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/4/2020 Famous streets, cafes, beaches, and train stations [show the changing] relationship to public space during the pandemic. Milan's cafes, Times Square, the Champs-Élysées, and even mosques, temples, and churches are free of humans. The global pandemic has made society united in humanity's survival. But it has also disrupted the most essential element of city life: public life. Nicholas Gutierrez Houston, Texas Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/8/2020 My sketch shows the route to the park from my bungalow duplex in the Houston Heights West historic district. My wife and I enjoy the brief and distant interactions with the countless people (and dogs) who have taken over the streets of Houston during this time of quarantine. It’s a reminder not to forget that the journey is just as important as the destination. Noah Tang Bloomington, Illinois Category: Virtual connections 5/10/2020 This is a map of my currently empty high school classroom. It is for the custodians who need to know where the desks are placed when cleaning the floors over the summer. Usually I would have to draw this map at the end of May, but with school closures, it happened earlier this year. I cannot say a proper good bye to my kids this year. No matter how stressful teaching in person was, I really cherished the human and face-to-face interactions. Watching them in their ""aha"" moments makes teaching worth it for me. Since March 13, we have been teaching classes online. It is not the same at all. I became a teacher for the constant contact with people, so this quarantine has been damaging for my mental health. However, as a history teacher, my students and I now truly feel how it is to live through a massively historic event. Patty Heyda St. Louis, Missouri Category: Redefined boundaries 5/28/2020 There's always more than one perspective. I mapped my bedroom where the spaces and views of pandemic life, family and work collide. My map charts the spaces now collapsed into one: my private personal space — kind of messy but vital; my ad-hoc office work space — cramped but creative, family stuff mixed with work affairs; and the Zoom stage set, a corporate professional publicly-oriented space ‚ which, fittingly, is more fabricated facade than actual space. I drew my map in a blended plan, perspective and close-up view, the way life now compresses how we see things. I highlight each view angle to show the perspective drawing-construction lines, with the associated terminology. Except now there are several superimposed sight lines, incident rays and angles, picture planes, station points and vanishing points. There is still one horizon-line — outside! My relationship with my family and the spaces in my house changed more during the coronavirus emergency than my relationship to my work or my neighborhood did — even though those things were technically the most 'rearranged.' My work-life shifted location dramatically, but work continued almost seamlessly on computers from home. What was jarred and impacted were my own precious spaces and relationships in my house. Drawing these multiple perspectives helps me, well, put things in perspective. I see how much we do to prop up work so seamlessly, but I also see how family perspectives become overlaid. Maybe someday our work spaces will accommodate our personal spaces as seamlessly and strategically as we accommodate them. Paula Ugarriza Bilbao, Spain Category: Natural callings 4/19/2020 The lockdown has made people scatter from the streets, and with them cars and noise. The map of silence shows how now only the dogs and birds, the wind and the church bells are heard from home, as well as the collective applause at 8 p.m. to thank the health workers for their work. Peggy Curran Montreal, Quebec Category: Redefined boundaries 4/27/2020 My map is a mosaic imagining our daily sanity walks. We are all living in our own gated communities these days, breaking out to walk or run errands and get a little air. I am ordinarily a destination walker — groceries, library, swimming pool, coffee. With most of the destinations now closed, I find myself walking in circles just to see the neighborhood and maybe catch a glimpse of something interesting. Peter Conrad California Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/29/2020 We don't go outside at all except to clap with our neighbors, so this home is the whole world now. We talk to our neighbors more, but we see the neighborhood less. Peter Gorman Waikoloa, Hawaii Category: Virtual connections 4/15/2020 During quarantine, all of the ways I interact with the world — commuting to work, going to the store, interacting with friends and family — have been compressed into a digital space. Getting from ""place"" to ""place"" is now based around my laptop keyboard. This map is a representation of my current life. Although it's frustrating to feel disconnected from my immediate surroundings, one silver lining is connecting with family and friends back home on the mainland (and all across the world). Qiqi Xu San Francisco, California Category: Redefined boundaries 4/5/2020 This is an abstracted map of the places I have been to since the shelter-in-place order started in San Francisco. Now I think of the outside world as parks and places where I can get takeout from time to time. I notice myself thinking through what streets I should take to the parks because some streets have a lot more runners. The pandemic has made me much more conscious of my surroundings, constantly assessing risks while I am outside. I am saddened by a lot of the local shops and restaurants having a hard time sustaining themselves, and I fear that the neighborhood will never have the same hustle and bustle. Being Asian, I also had never felt unsafe in this neighborhood, until the pandemic triggered racial tension and hatred towards people of East Asian ethnicities. Richard Dury Bergamo, Italy Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/13/2020 After being restricted to taking walks no longer than 200 metres from home, I decided to map this area, counting in paces and measuring angles with a carpenter's ruler. This way, I began to get familiar with the little world to which I was confined but did not know in detail. My experienced world is now that of a four-year-old child — it's interesting to go back there again. Rick Bohannon Minnesota Category: Natural callings 4/16/2020 Birding is being talked about as a great activity for this moment — easy to do while social distancing, gets you outside, connects you with the natural environment. This map is of my local neighborhood park, the first of a series of birding maps I'm making as a kind of diary of the pandemic. I'm going on more walks with my kids, and wondering why I didn't go on more before. Sam Emrich Denver, Colorado Category: Domestic rearrangements 5/8/2020 This is a drawing of my studio apartment, highlighting activities that were my former ""normal"" and the ones that are my ""new normal"" during quarantine, from yoga asanas to solo dance parties to howling out the window every evening at 8 p.m. in solidarity. We do it to say, ""We can't see each other, but we can hear each other. We're all still here. We're not alone."" Sarah Stancik Los Angeles, California Category: Redefined boundaries 4/20/2020 I’ve mapped a few common almost-interactions that happen within a block of my apartment: watching the mechanic work downstairs, picking up bread from the bakery, and walking and running around a small part of the neighborhood. Since the order to stay at home took effect, I spend most of the day inside working next to the windows. Usually I would leave for the park, but I’ve restricted any outdoor activity to residential areas. The orange trees and palms in my neighbor’s yards have become more familiar landmarks and my own garden of sorts. Sharmaine Montealegre Philippines Category: Psychic landscapes 4/27/2020 My map shows my daily destination ever since the lockdown started. It's kind of looking like an emergency exit plan, even though since this lockdown began I never step out of our home. My only true emergency exit is to look at the moon, and admire how each of its scars make it more even beautiful. Shivani New Delhi, India Category: Natural callings 4/25/2020 I have made a map that shows my minimal neighborhood activities with a zoomed-in version of my actual routine during lockdown. I am staying completely alone in my flat and my only connection with the outside world most of the days is my little balcony. Being an outdoor enthusiast, it has been pretty difficult for me, but my balcony gives me hope and life. This lockdown has made me appreciate the simplest of things. I appreciate sunrises and sunsets, blue skies, clouds, even more now. The sound of stray animals, the moving trees, the birds chirping makes everything so beautiful and alive. Stentor Danielson Bellevue, Pennsylvania Category: Psychic landscapes 4/7/2020 Being stuck in my apartment for the last few weeks, any adventures or grand journeys I go on have to be scaled down to match. (And since some of my friends were confused, the Red and Black God is Netflix.) Everything seems so much farther away. Even the post office a few blocks away feels like a dangerous journey now. Stephanie Bhim Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia Category: Natural callings 4/12/2020 My map presents the magnificent trees on my walk around the block, all different in their shape, size, blooms and fauna they attract. I am dwarfed by enormous gum and fig trees, delighted by butterflies, enchanted by mushrooms in the sidewalk grass. The olive trees hearken to folk tales. Working from home, I take these walks around the block and quiet backstreets. I enjoy the scent of jasmine, lorikeets squawking, butterflies in lilac hedges. With less cars and people around, nature is more apparent to me. Suzette Smith Portland, Oregon Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/22/2020 Portland has a lovely river loop, which stretches around four miles and which I'm fortunate to have in my neighborhood. Since the “Stay Home” order went into effect, I've hit the loop at different times throughout the day, trying to find that sweet spot where people stay an appropriate distance from me. But runners turn stupid from exertion (I have sympathy for this), and two-parent households with children can’t seem to imagine splitting into teams. On the bright side, I enjoy the smug expressions of the riverfront geese — they seem pretty sure they've won the great goose/human conflict. I live in Portland's curious night club/social services corridor. By day, the makeup of the neighborhood streets has shifted to an undiluted representation of people seeking transitional housing and other support services. Party people still seem to feel drawn here on weekend nights. They yell at one another from their cars, and I find it kind of charming. So I thought my relationship with my neighborhood had changed, but now that I wrote this, I realize it really hasn't. Tess McCann Cambridge, Massachusetts Category: Redefined boundaries 4/24/2020 This map shows our weekly path to the grocery store (Market Basket in Somerville). That journey happens to be in the same direction as the view out of my living room window, where my desk is. I catch myself thinking about the places beyond Market Basket where we don't go anymore. I remind myself that they're still there, connected by things that I do see on my walk to the grocery store. Ti Dinh Seattle, Washington Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/24/2020 My map lays out the many places you will find me each day, all from my couch. From here, I spend time with myself doing work (I'm a teacher), creating digital and fiber art, connecting with friends and neighbors over the Marco Polo app, and eating dinner, including the least couch-friendly meals. As a homebody and introvert, I love the little world afforded to me during this time. Zoe Swartz New Orleans, Louisiana Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/3/2020 This dresser houses the miscellaneous objects that tell the story of my life now, confined mostly to my house, and of my life before, which took place all over the city. Each rectangle represents a drawer filled with objects like scraps of fabric from Mardi Gras costumes, bike tools, mail that I don't want to deal with, my t-shirt collection, and art supplies. These odds and ends used to feel pretty insignificant, but now feel like an intimate bridge to the life that I was leading before coronavirus. Now they matter greatly to me. Lately I've been feeling okay with this calmer life. But sometimes I bike through the deserted French Quarter and feel a pang of loss for all of the interactions and spontaneous adventure that would be happening in the spring.

By Laura Bliss and Jessica Lee Martin June 18, 2020, 8:00 AM Share Share Share Share Share Maps are used to explore the world, but they also offer exploration within their own boundaries. The writer Rebecca Solnit once said in an interview: “Maps invite us to locate ourselves in relation to whatever they show, to enter the labyrinth that is each map and to find our way out by grasping what is mapped.” Making maps of your own world can amplify that experience, because it asks you to sort out what you think, feel, see, hear, and even desire in a place. In April, CityLab asked readers to share homemade maps of their lives during the coronavirus pandemic. The more than 400 maps we received are so many windows into what people around the globe have experienced through this extraordinary crisis, as well as its sprawling social consequences. Diverse in style and content, yet deeply connected in their themes, the maps collectively show how coronavirus has transformed the places we live. Beloved people, places, and activities were suddenly out of reach. Food, shelter, and other basics were vested with elevated importance; so were access to nature, creative outlets, and a sense of social connection. Under pressure and confinement, relationships and perspectives turned hyperlocal — and, in many cases, were widened by a sense of injustice about who was dying, and who was not. By late May, economies began to reopen and communities re-revised their sense of normal. Rage over the systemic racism that also played into the pandemic’s unequal death toll reached a boiling point in the U.S. and erupted into global demonstrations. With protesters filling streets that were empty and quiet mere weeks before, neighborhoods are transforming once more — and hold promise for further transformation. We invite you to explore this published selection of reader-made maps, organized into six thematic sections that reflect some of the pandemic’s effects. “Domestic rearrangements” examines shifting home lives. “Psychic landscapes” probes the emotional toll. “Redefined boundaries” surveys changed perceptions of wider surroundings. “Virtual connections” looks at the dominance of digital time. “Natural callings” taps into the lure of greenery and wildlife. Each map is accompanied by the words of the mapmaker, edited for clarity and flow. Our goal was to present a selection of maps based on a diversity of geographies, experiences, and artistic style. This video below presents this project and brings the maps to life. Share the video on Facebook and Twitter.

I particularly loved drawing the looming redwoods and clashing architecture. While drawing my favorite businesses in the area, I took some artistic liberty with their roofs for fun. To be honest, I took artistic liberty with the whole map because I couldn’t remember the exact details of the buildings and their foliage. Even though this map isn’t accurate, looking at it makes me deeply appreciate the privilege of where I live during these strange times. Agustina Martire Buenos Aires, Argentina Category: Redefined boundaries 4/18/2020 The map is a collage of the lockdown in Buenos Aires, where we are only allowed to go out for groceries and pharmacies. The red line is my walk, every other day, to buy the basics. The room I drew is where my five-year-old daughter and I spend most of the day, working remotely and homeschooling. I normally live in Belfast, but visit Buenos Aires every year. Normally I would spend most of the day here outside the house, meeting people for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Now all the socializing happens by phone. The neighborhood is still quite lively, as this is a very dense area of the city, but facemasks are compulsory so there is an unusual sense of mistrust. A woman in the queue at the butcher said: “I am smiling behind the mask,” which made us both laugh. Alayna Delgado Tampa, Florida Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/7/2020 I’m in graduate school and I’m staying with my mom, dad, and four younger siblings until I can move out in early May. It’s hectic, to say the least! Things have changed: So much leisurely strolling and biking! Saving money by only going out for necessities! I’ve also really fallen in love with how cute Tampa bungalows are. I forgot! Alex Chung New York, New York Category: Redefined boundaries 4/17/2020 My neighborhood map shows the roughly four-to-five-block radius that I considered to be my neighborhood prior to Covid-19. I have shown my home, which now serves a function as a school, as well as a home gym. I’ve shown key landmarks, which, after drawing the map, I realized were primarily locations to purchase food and other necessities. From my map, I’ve realized that I am only leaving my home to gather these essential items, and as such, I am no longer able to enjoy the more casual, unique elements of my neighborhood that make it what it is. One of my favorite parts of my neighborhood is being close to everything. Now, I have become attuned to the fact that even with all of these places nearby, I find myself with nowhere to go. Alex Wang Cupertino, California Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/16/2020 For many Cupertino residents, Blackberry Farm park has become the natural place to stroll to help relieve the tension from the challenges that this pandemic has brought. Silicon Valley professionals who are often too caught up in the hustle and bustle of the dynamic tech industry now have time to say hi to neighbors and to really stop and smell the roses. This is a good opportunity to use the break from routine, to re-evaluate what really matters to us. Folks are now also tapping into dormant networks to reconnect with meaningful friendships, and also being forced to acknowledge who we would’ve liked to be quarantined with, and the reverse, for that matter. Amna Azeem Sialkot, Pakistan Category: Redefined boundaries 4/11/2020 I have mapped the places that are etched in my memories. Being raised in a neighborhood that is socially very active and is located in the heart of downtown with all the necessary facilities available nearby has enabled me to make unforgettable memories, a glimpse of which I have shown in the map. This sudden epidemic has made us realize the little things we took for granted. Coronavirus has no doubt changed our lives by making us stay indoors. I feel very nostalgic when I think about the activities that I used to do. For now, my relationship with the neighborhood is limited. An Trinh Haiphong, Vietnam Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/17/2020 I have been in quarantine ever since I got back home from college. I got out of an ambulance in front of my door, and for weeks now, the only two places I can go are my room or my garden. I grew up in this neighborhood and can draw it in my sleep, but during this period, I cannot even have a walk outside. Hence, I decided to draw my new “neighborhood.” I can name all the vegetables and plants in my garden, know exactly where they are, how big they are, how many fruits and flowers on a tree, etc. It has changed vastly, as I cannot go out at all. I know that the market is still open and my mother still goes there once in a while, but many things are closed. I can imagine things, but I don't actually know how they are right now. Annita Parish Montreal, Canada Category: Natural callings 5/7/2020 I have never had the chance to explore my neighborhood as I now do. It’s amazing, since it offers me an opportunity to look around attentively, particularly at the trees. Although I've never labelled myself a dendrophile, there is something novel in trees that has changed my senses with everyday walking. In addition to their diverse shapes, locations, types, and blossoms that reappeared quickly at this time of year, their hollows and gestures of falling caught my attention, like a story behind their emptiness. Arthur Beaubois-Jude Calais, France Category: Redefined boundaries 5/4/2020 I like maps, and I do maps as a freelancer — I'm a cartographe, as we say. In France, if you have no professional or emergency reasons to go out, you have to stay at home, or you can take a walk within a one-kilometer radius. Because I'm very bored, and because nobody needs my maps during these times, I've done a map of my authorized living perimeter, and indicated the places of interest inside this little world. The center of my world? My home! I'm usually a stay-at-home person. But now, I just want to get out of this perimeter. Augusto Javier León Peralta Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia Category: Natural callings 4/19/2020 Within the blink of an eye, Covid-19 has changed our habits, reducing our sphere of action. The map shows the way I make a “ring” around my neighborhood for going shopping and, if necessary, to the bank and then back home. There is no dangerous traffic, no disturbing noises, no pollution. We can even see some animals in the city that were not seen before. Birds sing, they come to our balconies, the streets look clean. Of course, I am speaking only of my small neighborhood ring. I think this situation will serve to wipe away old habits which maybe were not the right ones, in order to raise awareness about protecting our world and through this taking care of ourselves. Aurelie Knecht San Luis Potosi, Mexico Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/9/2020 I escaped London for my boyfriend’s family house, which has transformed into a microcosm of our lives. Doing work, studying, exercising daily, eating a lot of tacos, drinking agua de piña to forget about the heat, and trying to go out for walks and hikes as soon as we can is now our new daily routine. It is not easy to be enclosed in a house that is not mine, but it is full of love and new experiences. It has become a sort of bubble we only rarely escape, and that we are happy to escape. The neighboring shops are the new attractions, whereas before we used to ignore them. Axel Forrester St. Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, United Kingdom Category: Psychic landscapes 4/30/2020 We discovered a beautiful old canyon near our house that looks like a lost world. My husband has been doing research on the history of the area and discovered that it was sold to the local council at cost for the public to enjoy in 1933 by a man named Herbert Povey. I wanted to make a fancy map for my grandson to discover it too when this lockdown is over. We moved here in November and we've certainly been discovering every inch of it, walking it every day. We love being close to Alexandra Park and these lovely hills, but this hidden valley is our favorite. It even has several waterfalls. We call it the Lost World Trail. Blanca Juan García Madrid, Spain Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/15/2020 During lockdown, I've been mostly confined to my home. I have no dog, and I live alone. My walks to the supermarket have been every 10 days, more or less. Before the government loosened the rules, my home had become my neighborhood and world in general. But now I can go outside for a walk, and I've been exploring my neighborhood. I moved to this part of the city in September, and due to my work, I couldn't explore it as I can do now. I'm discovering new shops, looking at people, and walking through a wood that is near my house. I’ve been very grateful. Brennan Walters Lacombe, Louisiana Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/4/2020 Just a quick sketch of Lacombe. Most residents here live along a bayou that feeds into Lake Pontchartrain, but there is a small “downtown” near a bend on Highway 190. We’re fortunate that much of life here revolves around the bayou, and that’s still open. It’s easy to maintain a six-foot distance, but Lacombe is a small town and you miss those little conversations after work stopping in Bayou Adventure or Da Crab Trap. Brian Palmer Cape Town, South Africa Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/5/2020 My map is a spin on the low perspective, pictorial maps that are often used for tourism. Instead of focusing on downtown Cape Town, Table Mountain National Park, and the waterfront, I shifted the perspective to the areas that tourists typically miss, namely the Cape Flats. These communities are home to some of the most vulnerable neighborhoods in the city as well as the most critically endangered sand fynbos nature preserves. While plenty of well-written policy is on the books to protect these at-risk people and ecosystems, attention still flows in the same direction as the art and media of the city. This map, watercolored into the wee hours of the morning, is my way of shifting these values by changing how we look at the cityscape of beautiful Cape Town. C.X. Hua Cambridge, Massachusetts Category: Natural callings 4/13/2020 I drew a map of all the sounds I heard on a long walk through my neighborhood. My small neighborhood has become my entire world! So things that used to seem small now seem much bigger. Birds seem louder. I drew this map because I found myself listening more intently as I walked and forming new dictionaries of sound in my head. Candelaria Mas Pohmajevic New York, New York Category: Virtual connections 4/22/2020 This is a map of my spot at home every day. I'm an urban design student and being in many cities at the same time is usual for me. But this time is unique because I'm nowhere and everywhere all the time. That computer connects me to the outside world. The only reminder I get from where I am is the window to the right, a glimpse to the characteristic New York City fire-escape stairs and the beautiful and changing shadows in a quarantined spring. Carla Ximena Carrillo Quintanilla Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia Category: Psychic landscapes 4/20/2020 The map is based on a video game named Bomberman. Like in the game, we carry a weapon, in this case the Covid-19 virus, which can kill us. The map is based on the path I must follow to reach different supply points without being caught by the enemy porting the virus. For this reason, social distancing has become our shield in this game of life. (Translated from Spanish by Erick Ruiz de Chavez) Carol Hsiung Millburn, New Jersey Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/5/2020 I drew this sketch reflecting what I saw and encountered on my dog walk down my street in Millburn, New Jersey, on one of those perfect sunny afternoons on a weekend when “everyone” seemed to be out — six feet apart. It made me feel nostalgic, remembering when I was a kid when kids played on the streets and neighbors talked with each other. I have been living here for 15 years and never saw so many families out walking and biking together — I even saw my husband ride by. I do not take my neighbors and neighborhood for granted anymore. I feel so lucky for living here. Champ Turner Austin, Texas Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/19/2020 My map shows a mile-long route through my neighborhood that I travel frequently. There are dozens of possible paths, but I selected the three I take most often. I've become more aware of the geography of my neighborhood, both on a macro and micro scale. I've become cognizant of the layout of streets, locations of specific landmarks, and the tiny details in people's yards that reveal things about their lives. Claudia Canedo Velasco Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia Category: Psychic landscapes 4/8/2020 From my place of peace, I imagine that the southern trees absorb the virus that comes from the north. A lot has changed: We communicate more, we collaborate for food purchases and we are in solidarity with each other. Constance Brown New Haven, Connecticut Category: Psychic landscapes 5/17/2020 My apartment is located smack in the middle of the map; my New Haven perambulations radiate out from it. Behind the map I've depicted dawn and dusk from my east-facing window; perched on the edge of the corona-frame is a local songbird, the Yellow-throated Vireo. I work at home as a mapmaker, so my work life is the same. Aside from occasional socially-distanced walks with friends and telecommunication, my social life is suspended, and I miss it. I miss our local restaurants, and worry about their fates. I'm grateful for our neighborhood markets and wine stores, which have stayed open. Always a lively pedestrian neighborhood, East Rock is even livelier, with walkers and runners out all the time. I'm more conscious of nature, and the new soundscape, which birds dominate. Strange to think that less than two miles away, Yale New Haven Hospital is a battleground. Edda Ívarsdóttir Iceland Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/5/2020 My map shows my house. After spending weeks staying at home working and learning there, it’s like our world has shrunk into it. Only leaving for running and occasional shopping. The city seems so quiet and tranquil, the birds and the cats seem to like it. All the cars are parked in the driveways, which is a nice change. We live close by a busy street and we feel there is a big difference in noise during rush hours. We see people going out more for biking and running than before. It’s overall a positive change. I hope we don’t go back to the way it was before, at least not all the way. Ele Denne Brussels, Belgium Category: Redefined boundaries 4/19/2020 This hibiscus flower, representing the blossoming trees here, is made up of the different bike routes I have taken over the past weeks around Brussels. In Brussels (the white area), the dominant language is French, but once you exit Brussels and enter Flanders (the surrounding pink area), everything is in Flemish Dutch. There are even some supermarkets from the Netherlands, with products that remind me of home. I also included some parks of the area to show the unequal spatial distribution of green spaces. This inequality became more acknowledged as an issue during the first weeks of quarantine, when the police sent someone who was taking a walk back to their neighborhood without many green spaces, even though there were no official distance limits. The size of my neighborhood is increasing and decreasing at the same time. It has decreased, because I have probably walked every single street around here right now, many of them full with blossoming cherry trees, and increased, because I have been biking in all possible directions to places I have never been before. Public transport is now only allowed for essential trips, but fortunately there is no distance limit on bike rides, and the streets are very calm, so I have been exploring the city and the countryside for the past weeks. Emily Benson Jackson, New Hampshire Category: Natural callings 5/2/2020 While we do not live in an urban setting, this map shows how ""busy"" our rural neighborhood is in the midst of the White Mountain National Forest. Staying at home during the height of the maple sugaring season in New Hampshire allowed us to have plenty of time to collect and process our maple sap, resulting in a record-breaking production of over 26 gallons of syrup this year. We have always been very close with our neighbors, which has proven to be a vital source of strength and support during these challenging times. Eric Hoke Nashville, Tennessee Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/13/2020 My map is focused around regular walking routes in our neighborhood. It shows the actual boundaries of Eastwood, a neighborhood within East Nashville, but the focus is the landmarks that my family has been frequently visiting during the pandemic. During recent walks, we have developed much better relationships with our neighbors because everyone is outside more. Esra Alim Samsun, Turkey Category: Psychic landscapes 5/28/2020 We are in quarantine nowadays, and this situation forces us to think about the mistakes we have made, our past and regrets. We are also thinking about our dreams, plans (travels, get-togethers, and so on). So I designed this mind map. I can travel to my past and future, with the help of this portal. Eva Spear Amsterdam, the Netherlands Category: Psychic landscapes 4/23/2020 I’ve retreated into my own world and drawn a map of the place I go to. My life has become more humane. More relaxed. It seems to me people tend to notice each other more, greet each other more. They seem more chilled out and interested in social contact, slowing down in the moment. Maybe I’m just speaking for myself. But the whole vibe sparks my creativity and lets my imagination run wild. Ezra Silkes San Diego, California Category: Redefined boundaries 4/7/2020 This is a map of the United States, as defined by where my friendships are. I just moved to San Diego, and have no attachment to it as a city. The cities I’m attached to are thousands of miles away from me, and I dearly miss the people in those cities. Quarantine has shrunk my world to just my house, but at the same time has reminded me that my world is much, much wider, and my connections span not only the country but the globe. Now, due to self-isolation, I will not have the chance to explore the neighborhood or surrounding areas. I will not get to know the people. I will stay inside and talk to the people I already know. As such, my neighborhood has grown to ignore all state borders and has become the people I loved before this crisis. Farah Makki Italy Category: Redefined boundaries 4/5/2020 I’ve been much more aware of the attractions and features around me and more appreciative of the available green areas. Francisca Benítez B. Brooklyn, New York Category: Redefined boundaries 4/24/2020 I yearn for my past places and communities. Now I walk more to the waterfront. By finding moments at home that mirror the outside world, the new routine could wash away the frustrations. Giannis Vlaxos Athens, Hlioupolis, Greece Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/24/2020 I live in a suburb of the prefecture of Attica in Greece. I stayed at home for more than two months — from March 11 until the end of May almost — avoiding contact and safely following only the necessary routes: 1 = home 2 = bakery 3 = supermarket 4 = newsstand 5 = church 6 = pharmacy I designed and edited this map on Google Earth. The coordinates and scale are accurate. Gro Slotsvik Bristol, United Kingdom Category: Psychic landscapes 4/19/2020 The author and illustrator Carson Ellis suggested drawing a “treasure map” as one of her daily Quarantine Art Club assignments and this was mine: a reminder to myself of what to do to stay happy during isolation. The mountains are based on the wonderful works of Christa Rijneveld and the sea monsters are from the Carta Marina (a brilliant 16th century map of the Nordic countries). My 11-month-old son also tried to help, by knocking over a cup of cold coffee onto the corner. Just in case you were wondering about the poor sea snake living in a darker bit of sea! Irene Palko Glasgow, Scotland Category: Redefined boundaries 4/29/2020 I arrived in Glasgow a few months ahead of the coronavirus pandemic at 63 years old, to a new home in a new city. It was also a totally new life: As the world shut down around me, I stared out of my window at the tree tops and the rain, afraid and disappointed. But I realized I was one of the lucky ones. The trees may be bare again before I can once more hug a friend or stranger, or simply stand next to another human being. In the meantime, the street will be my gallery, the park my theatre, and the world wide web my cafe, bar, and meeting place. Itzel Taboada Bolivia Category: Psychic landscapes 4/19/2020 This is the sunset that I see from my window, and the fresh air that only the virus gets to enjoy. Jackson S. Austin, Texas Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/18/2020 “This is a drawing about people who are finding ways to live positively during the lockdown. It's really weird that we're having to stay home for quite a long time. Everything is closed, we're not as busy as we once were. It's just an interesting time for all of us,” says Jackson about his map. Jackson has autism and I'm typing his thoughts for him. I'm his mom. James Hennessey Northern Ireland Category: Psychic landscapes 4/7/2020 More than ever, our little terraced house and garden have become a special sanctuary as we try to keep our family and those around us safe. On the one hand, [there is] an element of fear as we venture out for necessities, yet on the other, a heightened feeling of compassion with our neighbors and with strangers, as we jointly face this challenge. Jin Meiling Suzhou, China Category: Virtual connections 4/30/2020 My husband is German and I am Chinese. We met in Japan, and now are going through lockdown at our home in Suzhou, China. We both like cooking. Since lockdown started, we have cooked every day and I have learned several new dishes from different countries, as shown in my map. Sometimes, I get the cooking ideas from WeChat shared by friends and relatives. Chinese Guobaorou, a type of deep fried pork, is among them. It tastes good after several trials. But if I could choose, I would like to order in a restaurant. Joanna Chow Auckland, New Zealand Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/15/2020 We are in full lockdown for a minimum of four weeks. We have three adults working from home (and one more as an essential worker). Our entire neighborhood (or should I say world) has been shrunk down into just our home, and on the periphery are the nearest supermarket and our preferred walking routes around our home. Rather than waving and greeting each other as we leave and return home, we just wave to each other through the windows, if we happen to see each other. John Palumbi Baltimore, Maryland Category: Redefined boundaries 4/17/2020 This is a map of our cat’s nocturnal outdoor adventures during Covid-19. Ace is a 9-year-old indoor-outdoor cat who sometimes wears a collar with a GPS sports tracker. During the pandemic, he gets out a lot more than we do. As the map shows, we are experiencing our neighborhood through his eyes. Ace’s range is much larger than we would have ever imagined. He “patrols” alleys; snoops in people’s yards; pokes around near the waterfront; and (with fewer cars on the road) even crosses the street. While our personal “orbits” have severely contracted, our cat’s has enlarged. He walks a few miles around South Baltimore every night. Ace’s Adventure Map is something we look forward to each day as an antidote to our frustration and isolation. He still has the freedom to roam the city and we don't. We envy him. Jonas Vagnoux Bonneville, France Category: Redefined boundaries 4/16/2020 My map shows how my new relationship with space is transformed. The earth is not round anymore. I represented the single kilometer around my house where I can walk, run, ride my bike. Beyond this limit is the unknown. It is forbidden. I feel like I am in the Middle Ages, and I have to fight against a pioneer mindset that wants to explore what is beyond. Concerning time, my perception is also altered. We cannot spend more than one hour outside. So when I go for a walk, I savor every 3,600 seconds at my disposal. Justin Lini Washington, D.C. Category: Redefined boundaries 4/15/2020 My map shows how our view of the city has become oriented along the Anacostia River. Since social isolation began in March, my wife and I have been taking many walks around our neighborhood, but also to nearby Kenilworth Park. Normally people in the community don’t spend much time in Kenilworth Park. There’s not much in the way of things to do there, and it’s a little wild and overgrown. However, it has become an oasis to us in recent weeks, as it is a good way to go for a long stroll without running into a lot of people. One thing that I’ve really noticed, since I’m not driving and taking the metro everywhere, is that the natural and man-made barriers in the neighborhood have come to define the boundaries of this strange world. Justin Raymond Hernandez Miami Category: Psychic landscapes 4/18/2020 Like many people, quarantine has made me greatly miss seeing my friends and family. This got me thinking about how even under normal circumstances, I still remain physically distant from them because I don't have my own car. I created this fantasy transit map to highlight a hopeful future in which I'd be able to see them with ease and without having to drive. With no traffic and big-city rush, I've been able to bike around and appreciate the city’s green landscape and wonderful tropical weather. Often a community which comes across as being filled with self-obsessed individuals, I feel that Miami has always had issues with civic identity. But it has been wonderful seeing people supporting their neighbors at the moment. Karen Leu New York, New York Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/30/2020 Since New York has been on pause, I've been staying in my partner's studio. My world has shrunk but there has been a marked increase of legs in my living space. I miss my friends and family and being outside, but am grateful for sunlight and critters and comfort. I'm a relative newcomer to NYC. My car, which I'd drive every day before the lockdown, has been sitting in the same street spot. I'd adopted mask-wearing early and in the beginning would feel self-conscious going outside with one on. Now, those without are the ones being avoided. Kate Rutter Emeryville, California Category: Psychic landscapes 4/21/2020 Seeing nature up close and observing it with pen and paint is my most relaxing and rejuvenating activity. Usually I'm out in the world of nature. But now I must imagine my favorite places in my mind. This map was done in my home office as I captured some of my favorite nature spots from memory, starting at home and looking north. Each zone (home, neighborhood, town, and wilds) helped me revisit these places and appreciate them in a new way. Kayla Adolph Toledo, Ohio Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/21/2020 This map shows how our space changes by day and night based on our new routine. What once was just our living room is now a place of refuge at night when we're anxious. The neighborhood is both friendlier, scarier, and much smaller than it was before. We're becoming intimately aware of how interconnected the world is and it's intimidating at times. Kristi Lin San Diego, California Category: Virtual connections 4/14/2020 In my neighborhood, screens and windows open and close to different cities and countries. My neighborhood is vast yet cluttered, connected yet broken, behind my computer screen yet at the tip of my fingers. As a residential landscape designer, I am keenly aware of what my five senses can tell me about a neighborhood. Every site is unique, every place has a story. Working online has been difficult. Whereas I used to visiting neighborhoods that I design for in person, now I'm visiting them online, next to windows of breaking news. The visual bombardment has been overwhelming. A new neighborhood landscape of tabbed windows and collages of screen doors is taking shape. Lauren Nelson Arlington, Virginia Category: Redefined boundaries 4/11/2020 Now that public transit is closed except for essential travel, my wanderings are limited to walking and running within about a five-mile radius from my home. On foot, the Potomac River seems more pronounced as a physical barrier, separating Washington, D.C., from me in Arlington, Virginia. Although my neighborhood has always been walkable, the coronavirus emergency has changed my relationship to my neighborhood because most of the places I used to frequent are now closed. Having so many places close by and yet nowhere to go feels very paradoxical. Louis McNair Carlsbad, California Category: Psychic landscapes 5/15/2020 My map is interpretive of my feelings about our lockdown. It begins with my almost daily drive to work in a grocery store, shown in the thick black line. There are words, feelings, topics all over that represent what has gone through my mind during these times. As the words descend they go from color to black and grey, and the colorful neat words slowly transitions into grey messy words. María Liliana Solares Moreno Santa Cruz, Bolivia Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/19/2020 My map is about the difference between being at home and outside. Inside, we have the possibility to stay safe. But for this to happen, other people have to risk their lives — for example, police and doctors. They support our days in quarantine. In quarantine, I pay more attention to things like noises that are uncomfortable to me, such as kids screaming or the sounds of television. Marta Petteni Portland, Oregon Category: Psychic landscapes 4/26/2020 I am an Italian who has lived in Portland, Oregon, since 2017. My hometown, Bergamo, has been devastated by Covid-19, while in Portland, the situation is (or at least seems) better. My family and friends in Italy often share with me the ways that they are suffering from enclosure and the outdoors that they are missing. So I have started to more deeply enjoy the simple things of life, like reading under a tree, listening to the birds, or exploring my bizarre neighborhood. Often, while walking towards the park, I dream that I might turn the corner and find my Italian home there. It is a small yellow house with a grassy garden, an olive tree, and big windows. My parents are reading in the sun and my sister is waving at me, ready to join the walk. Even if the pandemic has made physical distances more painful, in my heart, my beloved worlds are even closer. Michele Tranquillini Milan, Italy Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/27/2020 During the quarantine I've felt gratitude for a lot of reasons every day, including having a safe and comfortable place to stay, loving people around me, a ukulele to play, and a tiny terrace with some plants. One day I decided to draw what I was seeing from my balcony — not exactly a map, but more a visual list or a postcard. I've felt a strong sense of connection to my neighbors: Singing, smiling, chatting, exchanging food (we are Italians!) from our windows and balconies was (and is) so important. As we rediscover a sense of community, I hope we won't forget what we've learned in these difficult days. Nawaf Al Mushayt Lisbon, Portugal Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/4/2020 Famous streets, cafes, beaches, and train stations [show the changing] relationship to public space during the pandemic. Milan's cafes, Times Square, the Champs-Élysées, and even mosques, temples, and churches are free of humans. The global pandemic has made society united in humanity's survival. But it has also disrupted the most essential element of city life: public life. Nicholas Gutierrez Houston, Texas Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/8/2020 My sketch shows the route to the park from my bungalow duplex in the Houston Heights West historic district. My wife and I enjoy the brief and distant interactions with the countless people (and dogs) who have taken over the streets of Houston during this time of quarantine. It’s a reminder not to forget that the journey is just as important as the destination. Noah Tang Bloomington, Illinois Category: Virtual connections 5/10/2020 This is a map of my currently empty high school classroom. It is for the custodians who need to know where the desks are placed when cleaning the floors over the summer. Usually I would have to draw this map at the end of May, but with school closures, it happened earlier this year. I cannot say a proper good bye to my kids this year. No matter how stressful teaching in person was, I really cherished the human and face-to-face interactions. Watching them in their ""aha"" moments makes teaching worth it for me. Since March 13, we have been teaching classes online. It is not the same at all. I became a teacher for the constant contact with people, so this quarantine has been damaging for my mental health. However, as a history teacher, my students and I now truly feel how it is to live through a massively historic event. Patty Heyda St. Louis, Missouri Category: Redefined boundaries 5/28/2020 There's always more than one perspective. I mapped my bedroom where the spaces and views of pandemic life, family and work collide. My map charts the spaces now collapsed into one: my private personal space — kind of messy but vital; my ad-hoc office work space — cramped but creative, family stuff mixed with work affairs; and the Zoom stage set, a corporate professional publicly-oriented space ‚ which, fittingly, is more fabricated facade than actual space. I drew my map in a blended plan, perspective and close-up view, the way life now compresses how we see things. I highlight each view angle to show the perspective drawing-construction lines, with the associated terminology. Except now there are several superimposed sight lines, incident rays and angles, picture planes, station points and vanishing points. There is still one horizon-line — outside! My relationship with my family and the spaces in my house changed more during the coronavirus emergency than my relationship to my work or my neighborhood did — even though those things were technically the most 'rearranged.' My work-life shifted location dramatically, but work continued almost seamlessly on computers from home. What was jarred and impacted were my own precious spaces and relationships in my house. Drawing these multiple perspectives helps me, well, put things in perspective. I see how much we do to prop up work so seamlessly, but I also see how family perspectives become overlaid. Maybe someday our work spaces will accommodate our personal spaces as seamlessly and strategically as we accommodate them. Paula Ugarriza Bilbao, Spain Category: Natural callings 4/19/2020 The lockdown has made people scatter from the streets, and with them cars and noise. The map of silence shows how now only the dogs and birds, the wind and the church bells are heard from home, as well as the collective applause at 8 p.m. to thank the health workers for their work. Peggy Curran Montreal, Quebec Category: Redefined boundaries 4/27/2020 My map is a mosaic imagining our daily sanity walks. We are all living in our own gated communities these days, breaking out to walk or run errands and get a little air. I am ordinarily a destination walker — groceries, library, swimming pool, coffee. With most of the destinations now closed, I find myself walking in circles just to see the neighborhood and maybe catch a glimpse of something interesting. Peter Conrad California Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/29/2020 We don't go outside at all except to clap with our neighbors, so this home is the whole world now. We talk to our neighbors more, but we see the neighborhood less. Peter Gorman Waikoloa, Hawaii Category: Virtual connections 4/15/2020 During quarantine, all of the ways I interact with the world — commuting to work, going to the store, interacting with friends and family — have been compressed into a digital space. Getting from ""place"" to ""place"" is now based around my laptop keyboard. This map is a representation of my current life. Although it's frustrating to feel disconnected from my immediate surroundings, one silver lining is connecting with family and friends back home on the mainland (and all across the world). Qiqi Xu San Francisco, California Category: Redefined boundaries 4/5/2020 This is an abstracted map of the places I have been to since the shelter-in-place order started in San Francisco. Now I think of the outside world as parks and places where I can get takeout from time to time. I notice myself thinking through what streets I should take to the parks because some streets have a lot more runners. The pandemic has made me much more conscious of my surroundings, constantly assessing risks while I am outside. I am saddened by a lot of the local shops and restaurants having a hard time sustaining themselves, and I fear that the neighborhood will never have the same hustle and bustle. Being Asian, I also had never felt unsafe in this neighborhood, until the pandemic triggered racial tension and hatred towards people of East Asian ethnicities. Richard Dury Bergamo, Italy Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/13/2020 After being restricted to taking walks no longer than 200 metres from home, I decided to map this area, counting in paces and measuring angles with a carpenter's ruler. This way, I began to get familiar with the little world to which I was confined but did not know in detail. My experienced world is now that of a four-year-old child — it's interesting to go back there again. Rick Bohannon Minnesota Category: Natural callings 4/16/2020 Birding is being talked about as a great activity for this moment — easy to do while social distancing, gets you outside, connects you with the natural environment. This map is of my local neighborhood park, the first of a series of birding maps I'm making as a kind of diary of the pandemic. I'm going on more walks with my kids, and wondering why I didn't go on more before. Sam Emrich Denver, Colorado Category: Domestic rearrangements 5/8/2020 This is a drawing of my studio apartment, highlighting activities that were my former ""normal"" and the ones that are my ""new normal"" during quarantine, from yoga asanas to solo dance parties to howling out the window every evening at 8 p.m. in solidarity. We do it to say, ""We can't see each other, but we can hear each other. We're all still here. We're not alone."" Sarah Stancik Los Angeles, California Category: Redefined boundaries 4/20/2020 I’ve mapped a few common almost-interactions that happen within a block of my apartment: watching the mechanic work downstairs, picking up bread from the bakery, and walking and running around a small part of the neighborhood. Since the order to stay at home took effect, I spend most of the day inside working next to the windows. Usually I would leave for the park, but I’ve restricted any outdoor activity to residential areas. The orange trees and palms in my neighbor’s yards have become more familiar landmarks and my own garden of sorts. Sharmaine Montealegre Philippines Category: Psychic landscapes 4/27/2020 My map shows my daily destination ever since the lockdown started. It's kind of looking like an emergency exit plan, even though since this lockdown began I never step out of our home. My only true emergency exit is to look at the moon, and admire how each of its scars make it more even beautiful. Shivani New Delhi, India Category: Natural callings 4/25/2020 I have made a map that shows my minimal neighborhood activities with a zoomed-in version of my actual routine during lockdown. I am staying completely alone in my flat and my only connection with the outside world most of the days is my little balcony. Being an outdoor enthusiast, it has been pretty difficult for me, but my balcony gives me hope and life. This lockdown has made me appreciate the simplest of things. I appreciate sunrises and sunsets, blue skies, clouds, even more now. The sound of stray animals, the moving trees, the birds chirping makes everything so beautiful and alive. Stentor Danielson Bellevue, Pennsylvania Category: Psychic landscapes 4/7/2020 Being stuck in my apartment for the last few weeks, any adventures or grand journeys I go on have to be scaled down to match. (And since some of my friends were confused, the Red and Black God is Netflix.) Everything seems so much farther away. Even the post office a few blocks away feels like a dangerous journey now. Stephanie Bhim Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia Category: Natural callings 4/12/2020 My map presents the magnificent trees on my walk around the block, all different in their shape, size, blooms and fauna they attract. I am dwarfed by enormous gum and fig trees, delighted by butterflies, enchanted by mushrooms in the sidewalk grass. The olive trees hearken to folk tales. Working from home, I take these walks around the block and quiet backstreets. I enjoy the scent of jasmine, lorikeets squawking, butterflies in lilac hedges. With less cars and people around, nature is more apparent to me. Suzette Smith Portland, Oregon Category: Neighborhood bonds 4/22/2020 Portland has a lovely river loop, which stretches around four miles and which I'm fortunate to have in my neighborhood. Since the “Stay Home” order went into effect, I've hit the loop at different times throughout the day, trying to find that sweet spot where people stay an appropriate distance from me. But runners turn stupid from exertion (I have sympathy for this), and two-parent households with children can’t seem to imagine splitting into teams. On the bright side, I enjoy the smug expressions of the riverfront geese — they seem pretty sure they've won the great goose/human conflict. I live in Portland's curious night club/social services corridor. By day, the makeup of the neighborhood streets has shifted to an undiluted representation of people seeking transitional housing and other support services. Party people still seem to feel drawn here on weekend nights. They yell at one another from their cars, and I find it kind of charming. So I thought my relationship with my neighborhood had changed, but now that I wrote this, I realize it really hasn't. Tess McCann Cambridge, Massachusetts Category: Redefined boundaries 4/24/2020 This map shows our weekly path to the grocery store (Market Basket in Somerville). That journey happens to be in the same direction as the view out of my living room window, where my desk is. I catch myself thinking about the places beyond Market Basket where we don't go anymore. I remind myself that they're still there, connected by things that I do see on my walk to the grocery store. Ti Dinh Seattle, Washington Category: Domestic rearrangements 4/24/2020 My map lays out the many places you will find me each day, all from my couch. From here, I spend time with myself doing work (I'm a teacher), creating digital and fiber art, connecting with friends and neighbors over the Marco Polo app, and eating dinner, including the least couch-friendly meals. As a homebody and introvert, I love the little world afforded to me during this time. Zoe Swartz New Orleans, Louisiana Category: Neighborhood bonds 5/3/2020 This dresser houses the miscellaneous objects that tell the story of my life now, confined mostly to my house, and of my life before, which took place all over the city. Each rectangle represents a drawer filled with objects like scraps of fabric from Mardi Gras costumes, bike tools, mail that I don't want to deal with, my t-shirt collection, and art supplies. These odds and ends used to feel pretty insignificant, but now feel like an intimate bridge to the life that I was leading before coronavirus. Now they matter greatly to me. Lately I've been feeling okay with this calmer life. But sometimes I bike through the deserted French Quarter and feel a pang of loss for all of the interactions and spontaneous adventure that would be happening in the spring.

Photographer: OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP Photographer: OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP The stock market has been on a tear, yet the economy is in the dumps. So why do so many people believe -- undoubtedly incorrectly -- that the stock market has decoupled from reality? The economy many people experience, while bleak, is local, personal and, for the most part, either not publicly traded or plays only a small part in the stock market’s moves. To explain why these personal experiences have so little effect on equity markets, we must look more closely at the market role of the weakest industry sectors. The surprising conclusion: The most visible and economically vulnerable industries are also among the smallest, based on their market-capitalization weight in major indexes such as the S&P 500. Markets, it turns out, are not especially vulnerable to highly visible but relatively tiny industries. The 30 most economically damaged industry categories could be de-listed before tomorrow’s market open, and it would hardly shave more than a few percentage points off the S&P 500. This is so despite the worst U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression. All of the economic data is so bad that figures on gross domestic product, unemployment and initial jobless claims must be re-scaled to even fit on charts. More from The Presidential Platform America Really Needs Now Manufacturers Plot Future of Factories in M&A FDA Made the Right Call on Covid Plasma Treatment Biden and Trump Go Cloud to Cloud But the U.S. economy is not the stock market and vice versa. As we discussed before, ignoring overseas strength is a major oversight. The so-called FAANGs (along with Microsoft) 1 derive about half -- and in some cases even more -- of their revenue from abroad. Beyond that, the pandemic lockdown in the U.S. has benefitted the giant tech companies’ sales and profits. No wonder the Nasdaq Composite 100 Index, which is dominated by big tech companies, is up about 26% this year. But a reasonable person might argue that GDP fell by about a third in the second quarter and the S&P 500 should be in synch with that. What’s more, of the 500 companies in the S&P 500, about 450 of them are doing terribly. Industries such as retail, travel, energy, entertainment, dining have seen sales evaporate. Bankruptcies are piling up -- legendary retailer Lord & Taylor is just the latest -- and more are surely coming. Yet, the S&P 500, after a huge plunge in March, is up 2% this year. Market capitalization explains why. Start with some of 2020’s worst-performing industries: Year-to-date (as of the end of July), these include department stores, down 62.6%; airlines, off 55%; travel services, down 51.4%; oil and gas equipment and services, down 50.5%; resorts and casinos, down 45.4%; and hotel and motel real estate investment trusts, off 41.9%. The next 15 industry sectors in the index are down between 30.5% and 41.7%. And that’s four months after the market rebounded from the lows of late March. These are highly visible industries, with companies that are well-covered by the news media with household names known to many consumers. Retailers are everywhere we go. Gas stations, chain restaurants and hotels are ubiquitous in cities and suburbs across the country. So although high visibility industries may be of considerable significance to the economy, they are not very significant to the capitalization-weighted stock market indexes. Consider how little these beaten-up sectors mentioned above affect the indexes. Department stores may have fallen 62.3%, but on a market-cap basis they are a mere 0.01% of the S&P 500. Airlines are larger, but not much: They weigh in at 0.18% of the index. The story is the same for travel services, hotel and motel REITs, and resorts and casinos. The market is telling us that these industries just don’t matter very much to stock market performance. And the sectors that do matter? Consider just four industry group -- internet content, software infrastructure, consumer electronics and internet retailers -- account for more than $8 trillion in market value, or almost a quarter of total U.S. stock market value of about $35 trillion. Take the 10 biggest technology companies in the S&P 500 and weight them equally, and they would be up more than 37% for the year. Do the same for the next 490 names in the index, and they are down about 7.7%. That shows just how much a few giants matter to the index. On some level, it’s completely understandable why many people believe that markets are no longer tethered to reality because the performance doesn’t correspond to their personal experience, which is one of job loss, economic hardship and personal despair. But what’s important to understand is that indexes based on market-cap weighting can be -- as they are now -- driven by the gains of just a handful of companies. We can argue about whether the way the market reacts is good or bad and never reach a satisfying conclusion. But one thing the market isn’t is irrational or disconnected from is the reality of market capitalization, and its impact on stock indexes. Both before and especially since the pandemic, those six stocks have been the biggest drivers of the market-cap weighted indexes like the Nasdaq 100 or the S&P 500.

It collapses hundreds of stories into one, advice-filled tale that runs the business cycle, from idea to launch to exit. I asked him about these inspiring people—as well as the mundane world of working from home. Here are edited excerpts: Is remote work the long-standing norm for entrepreneurs? More than half of the businesses that I’ve featured started at home, if not 60% or 70%. Most of the time it’s because they don’t have another option and, in virtually every case, because they can make their product from home. Chet Pipkin, who founded [electronics company] Belkin, started in his mom and dad’s garage. Same story with Lisa Price, who started Carol’s Daughter—she started mixing creams and oils in her kitchen. And with Peter Rahal, who started RxBar and began to grind and mash up dates and nuts and egg powder. What do you think post-pandemic remote working will look like? I don’t think it’s a substitute for working in the office. There’s none of the hallway serendipity, nor the togetherness of the lunch table. Eventually we will probably have more hybrid models, where we will work from home but also be in the office to interact and communicate, because that’s where great ideas come from. How are entrepreneurs doing these days? This is the most challenging moment for any business leader or entrepreneur. Even if you’re running Slack or Zoom, those companies have challenges because they’ve had to onboard millions of people in a short period of time. How are CEOs of struggling companies holding up? We’ve had some honest conversations with people like Jen Hyman of Rent the Runway [which closed its retail stores in mid-August]. We had Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, on recently, who saw his business go down 80% in a matter of weeks and had to lay off 25% of staff. And his answer was: “Well, I wake up, I put on sweatpants, and I stare at my computer for 18 hours.” What mindset is getting them through? They’re taking the long view. They’ve been through crises in starting a company and understand that crisis is part and parcel of any kind of startup. They understand that if they can survive this, if they can conserve cash, if they can cut costs and keep the ship afloat, they will survive and be OK. What does success look like? The companies that are surviving and even thriving are the ones that have taken big swings and done disruptive things that are kind of radical. It doesn’t have to be a costly decision, but it has to be radical, because a lot of these innovative decisions come out of crises. There’s a sense of radical necessity. What do entrepreneurs need to know? That a business is a series of problems you have to solve, one step at a time. You jump on one lily pad, you solve that problem, and then you go to the next lily pad and solve that problem. And when a business becomes sustainable is when the problems become manageable. The problems never end, but eventually they just become part of the routine. Illustrations: Oscar Bolton Green for Bloomberg Businessweek Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It collapses hundreds of stories into one, advice-filled tale that runs the business cycle, from idea to launch to exit.

They have the clout and financial might of the energy behemoths that plumbed the world over for oil and gas before them. But instead of digging mines and drilling wells, they’re leading the race to electrify the global economy. These four companies—Enel, Iberdrola, NextEra Energy and Orsted—prioritized the building or buying of clean-power plants when those assets were still considered alternative and expensive. Now they’re on the cusp of a breakthrough. Ever-cheaper solar panels and wind turbines are beginning to dominate new power installations, threatening the growth of natural gas on our power grids and upending energy markets.

In 2017, it formed China Energy Investment Corp. by merging two state-owned giants. The company has close to 40 gigawatts of renewable power generation capacity, according to BloombergNEF, more than any of the European and American majors. Coal is still a huge part of its business, with 185 gigawatts of thermal power produced in 2019. Unlike the biggest clean-energy giants in Europe, China Energy is almost entirely focused on its home market. Other big renewables players include Brookfield Renewable Partners, whose portfolio includes 7,900 megawatts of hydro and 4,700 megawatts of wind, and RWE AG, whose renewables unit is planning to invest up to 5 billion euros ($6 billion) until 2022 on renewables and storage technologies. Renewable energy such as solar and wind can be generated without producing heat-trapping carbon dioxide. A global transition to these cleaner fuels is the only chance we have of avoiding the most catastrophic effects of climate change. An estimated $11 trillion of renewables investment will be needed in the next 30 years to make that happen, and investors want in. The tipping point may come next year, when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. projects that spending on renewable power will overtake that of oil and gas drilling for the first time. And it’s all happening as the electrification of automobiles and heating in buildings start to take root. “Over the long term, electricity is going to steal market share from other sources of energy,” says Shayle Kann, a managing director at Energy Impact Partners, a New York-based investment fund. Clean supermajors overtook fossil fuel giants Florida-based NextEra Energy Inc., the world’s most valuable utility, briefly surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp. in market capitalization in early October. It wasn’t a one-off. Enel, Iberdrola and Orsted are now worth more than comparable oil majors, underscoring how mainstream clean energy bets have become for investors.

Five years ago, clean power was still viewed as a tumultuous and fragmented business, crowded with upstarts trying to grab a slice of an emerging market. Some of the early juggernauts were in the midst of high-profile collapses. Today, clean energy is considered such a safe bet that pension funds and insurers are competing to own large portfolios of solar and wind farms. Renewables capacity 22GW Market cap $147B Employees 15K Locations: Based in U.S., operating in U.S. and Canada Investment pipeline: $60 billion from 2019 through 2022 The world’s biggest investor-owned producer of solar and wind energy has enough renewable capacity to power Belgium. In its home state of Florida, it owns utilities with power plants that still run on fossil fuels even as it develops more sources of clean power. It’s also trying to grow even bigger, though reported bids this year to acquire Duke Energy Corp. and Evergy Inc. haven't been successful. Big goal: 30 million new solar panels by 2030 in Florida NextEra’s Golden Hills wind farm in Alameda County, Calif. Photographer: Steve Proehl / Getty Images Global consumption of clean energy has soared over the last decade, as companies more than doubled the amount of electricity they are able to produce using zero-emission technologies like solar panels and wind turbines. Early entrants became major players thanks in part to generous government subsidies at a time when clean power wasn’t commercially profitable. Over the years, they’ve grown through aggressive dealmaking and lobbying, turning their head start into a chasm.

But energy giants have been around for a long time. Fossil fuels begat the Industrial Revolution, but it was the harnessing of petroleum to power cars, planes, trucks, ships and trains that helped forge the modern economy. Unceasing demand for fuel prompted explorers to scour the globe for new discoveries—painstaking and costly expeditions that created some of the world’s most powerful companies. Renewables are now the cheapest form of new electricity in most of the world, which helps explain why they’re spreading in the majority of markets—powered by the clean supermajors. Wind and solar supply about 9% of electricity globally and their share will rise to 56% by midcentury, according to BloombergNEF. Expanded to six continents Many of the biggest renewable companies started in fossil fuels but began investing in renewable power years, sometimes decades, ago. Some have phased out coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, or plan to do so in the near future. Many have also begun committing to going carbon-free by 2050. Enel SpA is now Europe’s biggest utility and it’s rapidly expanding outside the continent as it gets greener. About 40% of the company’s 87 gigawatts of installed capacity is still made up of coal, oil and gas, but the Italian company is planning to reduce coal generation by 74% in 2022 and more than double its renewable power capacity by 2030. Renewables capacity 44GW Market cap $103B Employees 67K Locations: Based in Italy, operating in more than 30 countries including Morocco, South Africa, Chile, India and Canada Investment pipeline: $190 billion to 2030 Enel is Europe’s biggest utility. Its green power unit was founded in 2008, making it one of the veterans of the clean energy market. The company plans to spend 160 billion euros ($190 billion) over the next 10 years to more than double its renewable portfolio. With its broad geographic reach, Enel is positioned to help a growing number of countries make the transition to cleaner grids. Big goal: Boost renewable capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2030 Guadarranque solar plant in Spain. Photographer: Enel Green Power Some of the largest owners of wind and solar capacity will likely continue to be Chinese state-owned power companies. But all the clean energy supermajors will be defined by their geographic diversity, says Tom Heggarty, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. Enel and Iberdrola have been among the first to expand, with growing presences in Latin America, North America and Australia. Built island-size wind farms In the era of electric power, the world’s most coveted energy hot spots aren’t those harboring oil and gas deep in the ground. Green supermajors have embarked on a global hunt for places where the sun shines strongly and the wind blows steadily. Mega-size solar farms already cover large swaths of desert, from Morocco to Chile to Australia, while the battle for wind is increasingly happening at sea. Offshore wind has become one of the most hotly contested sectors. Clean supermajors like Denmark’s Orsted are years into a sea grab to install wind turbines as tall as skyscrapers in the waters surrounding Europe, and are positioning themselves for the sector’s rise in the U.S. and parts of Asia including South Korea and Japan. Man-made Islands Ocean infrastructure with areas the size of inhabited islands Orsted’s Hornsea One 1.2GW vs. Zakynthos, Greece 407 km2 Iberdrola’s East Anglia One 714MW vs. Malta 300 km2 Orsted’s Walney Wind Farms 1GW vs. Smola, Norway 218 km2 Orsted’s London Array 630MW vs. Sylt, Germany 100 km2 Note: East Anglia One, Walney Wind Farms and London Array are joint ventures. Islands are within 16 km2 of their wind farm of comparable size Sources: BloombergNEF, Sentinel Hub, Copernicus Sentinel-2 “You can always debate how to define ‘renewable energy supermajor,’ but for us it means we want to grow significantly by geography,” says Martin Neubert, Orsted’s chief executive officer for offshore. “It took us 30 years to create an industry, we now want to double or quadruple that in a much shorter period of time.” Renewables capacity 11GW Market cap $76B Employees 6K Locations: Based in Denmark, operating in Denmark, U.K., Germany, U.S., Netherlands, Taiwan Investment pipeline: $32 billion from 2019 to 2025 Formerly known as DONG Energy, short for Danish Oil and Natural Gas, the company has shed its fossil fuel assets and expanded its clean energy business to develop projects around the world. Orsted runs about a quarter of the world’s operational wind farms at sea and has projects in development that will roughly double its capacity by 2025. The company is also working with some of the world’s biggest oil and chemical companies to develop a market for low-carbon hydrogen produced from its wind farms. Big goal: 30 gigawatts of renewable power capacity by 2030 Orsted's Walney offshore wind farm off the coast of the U.K. Photographer: Orsted Powered city grids In some countries such as Germany or the U.K., renewable power already covers a significant percentage of the demand—at least on certain days. During this year’s coronavirus lockdowns, the decline in power demand led to the shutdown of fossil fuel power plants in Germany. That, in turn, resulted in renewables accounting for more than three quarters of power in the grid on April 20. “The grid really saw a glimpse of the future, and by and large nothing broke,” says David Hostert, head of research at BNEF in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “That was not clear from the outset.” Germany Power Wind and solar have surpassed 50% of the grid’s capacity Wind Solar Other 54% 2010 2015 2020 54% 2010 2015 2020 54% 2010 2015 2020 Source: Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE Take one vivid example: On Oct. 11, South Australia became the first major jurisdiction to be powered solely by solar energy. It lasted just over an hour. A few years ago the Australian state had a massive problem with blackouts, making it the perfect place for Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk to install what was at the time the biggest battery project of its kind. Now, solar power makes up around half of the energy on the grid during the day. Among the top players in the state is Iberdrola, which earlier this year bought Infigen Energy and now operates over 800 megawatts of solar, wind and battery in the country, with 453 megawatts more under construction. Enel operates two solar farms in South Australia, with a combined capacity of 275 megawatts. “We have been pioneers in the energy revolution for 20 years, when nobody believed then that the electricity could be produced with clean sources,” says Ignacio Sanchez Galan, Iberdrola’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Everybody was thinking that coal would remain for centuries and that oil and gas were absolutely needed, and we could already generate and produce electricity with clean sources.” Renewables capacity 34GW Market cap $87B Employees 36K Locations: Based in Spain, operating in countries including U.S., U.K., Mexico, Brazil and Australia Investment pipeline: $89 billion from 2020 to 2025 Iberdrola has been slowly building hydroelectric dams and onshore wind farms for years. Now it’s aiming to be the world’s biggest producer of green electricity. The company spent 2020 on a buying spree, investing 10 billion euros to scale up its business as part of a plan to almost double its renewable power capacity to 60 gigawatts. It’s also investing in new technologies like green hydrogen and ammonia, and in electric vehicle chargers. Big goal: Installed renewable capacity of 95 gigawatts by 2030 Port Augusta Solar power station, South Australia. Photographer: John White Photos / Getty Images While European utilities have swiftly built their clean portfolios, oil majors still have the means to add scale and expertise through acquisitions. Many also have sizable research and development teams, which could help them own new technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture ahead of their utility rivals. Some are pushing to catch up. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has made investments in renewables companies and electric-car charging networks, and BP Plc recently pledged to generate 50 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, up from about 2.5 gigawatts today. Spain’s Repsol SA is now investing more in renewable energy than in oil and gas exploration. If the energy story of the 20th century was oil, then this will be the century of electricity.

They have the clout and financial might of the energy behemoths that plumbed the world over for oil and gas before them. But instead of digging mines and drilling wells, they’re leading the race to electrify the global economy. These four companies—Enel, Iberdrola, NextEra Energy and Orsted—prioritized the building or buying of clean-power plants when those assets were still considered alternative and expensive. Now they’re on the cusp of a breakthrough. Ever-cheaper solar panels and wind turbines are beginning to dominate new power installations, threatening the growth of natural gas on our power grids and upending energy markets.

In 2017, it formed China Energy Investment Corp. by merging two state-owned giants. The company has close to 40 gigawatts of renewable power generation capacity, according to BloombergNEF, more than any of the European and American majors. Coal is still a huge part of its business, with 185 gigawatts of thermal power produced in 2019. Unlike the biggest clean-energy giants in Europe, China Energy is almost entirely focused on its home market. Other big renewables players include Brookfield Renewable Partners, whose portfolio includes 7,900 megawatts of hydro and 4,700 megawatts of wind, and RWE AG, whose renewables unit is planning to invest up to 5 billion euros ($6 billion) until 2022 on renewables and storage technologies. Renewable energy such as solar and wind can be generated without producing heat-trapping carbon dioxide. A global transition to these cleaner fuels is the only chance we have of avoiding the most catastrophic effects of climate change. An estimated $11 trillion of renewables investment will be needed in the next 30 years to make that happen, and investors want in. The tipping point may come next year, when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. projects that spending on renewable power will overtake that of oil and gas drilling for the first time. And it’s all happening as the electrification of automobiles and heating in buildings start to take root. “Over the long term, electricity is going to steal market share from other sources of energy,” says Shayle Kann, a managing director at Energy Impact Partners, a New York-based investment fund. Clean supermajors overtook fossil fuel giants Florida-based NextEra Energy Inc., the world’s most valuable utility, briefly surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp. in market capitalization in early October. It wasn’t a one-off. Enel, Iberdrola and Orsted are now worth more than comparable oil majors, underscoring how mainstream clean energy bets have become for investors.

Five years ago, clean power was still viewed as a tumultuous and fragmented business, crowded with upstarts trying to grab a slice of an emerging market. Some of the early juggernauts were in the midst of high-profile collapses. Today, clean energy is considered such a safe bet that pension funds and insurers are competing to own large portfolios of solar and wind farms. Renewables capacity 22GW Market cap $147B Employees 15K Locations: Based in U.S., operating in U.S. and Canada Investment pipeline: $60 billion from 2019 through 2022 The world’s biggest investor-owned producer of solar and wind energy has enough renewable capacity to power Belgium. In its home state of Florida, it owns utilities with power plants that still run on fossil fuels even as it develops more sources of clean power. It’s also trying to grow even bigger, though reported bids this year to acquire Duke Energy Corp. and Evergy Inc. haven't been successful. Big goal: 30 million new solar panels by 2030 in Florida NextEra’s Golden Hills wind farm in Alameda County, Calif. Photographer: Steve Proehl / Getty Images Global consumption of clean energy has soared over the last decade, as companies more than doubled the amount of electricity they are able to produce using zero-emission technologies like solar panels and wind turbines. Early entrants became major players thanks in part to generous government subsidies at a time when clean power wasn’t commercially profitable. Over the years, they’ve grown through aggressive dealmaking and lobbying, turning their head start into a chasm.

But energy giants have been around for a long time. Fossil fuels begat the Industrial Revolution, but it was the harnessing of petroleum to power cars, planes, trucks, ships and trains that helped forge the modern economy. Unceasing demand for fuel prompted explorers to scour the globe for new discoveries—painstaking and costly expeditions that created some of the world’s most powerful companies. Renewables are now the cheapest form of new electricity in most of the world, which helps explain why they’re spreading in the majority of markets—powered by the clean supermajors. Wind and solar supply about 9% of electricity globally and their share will rise to 56% by midcentury, according to BloombergNEF. Expanded to six continents Many of the biggest renewable companies started in fossil fuels but began investing in renewable power years, sometimes decades, ago. Some have phased out coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, or plan to do so in the near future. Many have also begun committing to going carbon-free by 2050. Enel SpA is now Europe’s biggest utility and it’s rapidly expanding outside the continent as it gets greener. About 40% of the company’s 87 gigawatts of installed capacity is still made up of coal, oil and gas, but the Italian company is planning to reduce coal generation by 74% in 2022 and more than double its renewable power capacity by 2030. Renewables capacity 44GW Market cap $103B Employees 67K Locations: Based in Italy, operating in more than 30 countries including Morocco, South Africa, Chile, India and Canada Investment pipeline: $190 billion to 2030 Enel is Europe’s biggest utility. Its green power unit was founded in 2008, making it one of the veterans of the clean energy market. The company plans to spend 160 billion euros ($190 billion) over the next 10 years to more than double its renewable portfolio. With its broad geographic reach, Enel is positioned to help a growing number of countries make the transition to cleaner grids. Big goal: Boost renewable capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2030 Guadarranque solar plant in Spain. Photographer: Enel Green Power Some of the largest owners of wind and solar capacity will likely continue to be Chinese state-owned power companies. But all the clean energy supermajors will be defined by their geographic diversity, says Tom Heggarty, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. Enel and Iberdrola have been among the first to expand, with growing presences in Latin America, North America and Australia. Built island-size wind farms In the era of electric power, the world’s most coveted energy hot spots aren’t those harboring oil and gas deep in the ground. Green supermajors have embarked on a global hunt for places where the sun shines strongly and the wind blows steadily. Mega-size solar farms already cover large swaths of desert, from Morocco to Chile to Australia, while the battle for wind is increasingly happening at sea. Offshore wind has become one of the most hotly contested sectors. Clean supermajors like Denmark’s Orsted are years into a sea grab to install wind turbines as tall as skyscrapers in the waters surrounding Europe, and are positioning themselves for the sector’s rise in the U.S. and parts of Asia including South Korea and Japan. Man-made Islands Ocean infrastructure with areas the size of inhabited islands Orsted’s Hornsea One 1.2GW vs. Zakynthos, Greece 407 km2 Iberdrola’s East Anglia One 714MW vs. Malta 300 km2 Orsted’s Walney Wind Farms 1GW vs. Smola, Norway 218 km2 Orsted’s London Array 630MW vs. Sylt, Germany 100 km2 Note: East Anglia One, Walney Wind Farms and London Array are joint ventures. Islands are within 16 km2 of their wind farm of comparable size Sources: BloombergNEF, Sentinel Hub, Copernicus Sentinel-2 “You can always debate how to define ‘renewable energy supermajor,’ but for us it means we want to grow significantly by geography,” says Martin Neubert, Orsted’s chief executive officer for offshore. “It took us 30 years to create an industry, we now want to double or quadruple that in a much shorter period of time.” Renewables capacity 11GW Market cap $76B Employees 6K Locations: Based in Denmark, operating in Denmark, U.K., Germany, U.S., Netherlands, Taiwan Investment pipeline: $32 billion from 2019 to 2025 Formerly known as DONG Energy, short for Danish Oil and Natural Gas, the company has shed its fossil fuel assets and expanded its clean energy business to develop projects around the world. Orsted runs about a quarter of the world’s operational wind farms at sea and has projects in development that will roughly double its capacity by 2025. The company is also working with some of the world’s biggest oil and chemical companies to develop a market for low-carbon hydrogen produced from its wind farms. Big goal: 30 gigawatts of renewable power capacity by 2030 Orsted's Walney offshore wind farm off the coast of the U.K. Photographer: Orsted Powered city grids In some countries such as Germany or the U.K., renewable power already covers a significant percentage of the demand—at least on certain days. During this year’s coronavirus lockdowns, the decline in power demand led to the shutdown of fossil fuel power plants in Germany. That, in turn, resulted in renewables accounting for more than three quarters of power in the grid on April 20. “The grid really saw a glimpse of the future, and by and large nothing broke,” says David Hostert, head of research at BNEF in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “That was not clear from the outset.” Germany Power Wind and solar have surpassed 50% of the grid’s capacity Wind Solar Other 54% 2010 2015 2020 54% 2010 2015 2020 54% 2010 2015 2020 Source: Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE Take one vivid example: On Oct. 11, South Australia became the first major jurisdiction to be powered solely by solar energy. It lasted just over an hour. A few years ago the Australian state had a massive problem with blackouts, making it the perfect place for Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk to install what was at the time the biggest battery project of its kind. Now, solar power makes up around half of the energy on the grid during the day. Among the top players in the state is Iberdrola, which earlier this year bought Infigen Energy and now operates over 800 megawatts of solar, wind and battery in the country, with 453 megawatts more under construction. Enel operates two solar farms in South Australia, with a combined capacity of 275 megawatts. “We have been pioneers in the energy revolution for 20 years, when nobody believed then that the electricity could be produced with clean sources,” says Ignacio Sanchez Galan, Iberdrola’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Everybody was thinking that coal would remain for centuries and that oil and gas were absolutely needed, and we could already generate and produce electricity with clean sources.” Renewables capacity 34GW Market cap $87B Employees 36K Locations: Based in Spain, operating in countries including U.S., U.K., Mexico, Brazil and Australia Investment pipeline: $89 billion from 2020 to 2025 Iberdrola has been slowly building hydroelectric dams and onshore wind farms for years. Now it’s aiming to be the world’s biggest producer of green electricity. The company spent 2020 on a buying spree, investing 10 billion euros to scale up its business as part of a plan to almost double its renewable power capacity to 60 gigawatts. It’s also investing in new technologies like green hydrogen and ammonia, and in electric vehicle chargers. Big goal: Installed renewable capacity of 95 gigawatts by 2030 Port Augusta Solar power station, South Australia. Photographer: John White Photos / Getty Images While European utilities have swiftly built their clean portfolios, oil majors still have the means to add scale and expertise through acquisitions. Many also have sizable research and development teams, which could help them own new technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture ahead of their utility rivals. Some are pushing to catch up. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has made investments in renewables companies and electric-car charging networks, and BP Plc recently pledged to generate 50 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, up from about 2.5 gigawatts today. Spain’s Repsol SA is now investing more in renewable energy than in oil and gas exploration. If the energy story of the 20th century was oil, then this will be the century of electricity.

It’s the question hanging over just about everything since Covid-19 took over the world last year. The answer can be measured in vaccinations. Bloomberg has built the biggest database of Covid-19 shots given around the world, with more than 119 million doses administered worldwide. U.S. science officials such as Anthony Fauci have suggested it will take 70% to 85% coverage of the population for things to return to normal. Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker shows that some countries are making far more rapid progress than others, using 75% coverage with a two-dose vaccine as a target. Israel, the country with the highest vaccination rate in the world, is headed for 75% coverage in just two months. The U.S. will get there just in time to ring in the 2022 New Year (though North Dakota could get there six months sooner than Texas). With vaccinations happening more rapidly in richer Western countries than the rest of the globe, it will take the world as a whole seven years at the current pace. Bloomberg’s calculator provides a snapshot in time, designed to put today’s vaccination rates into perspective. It uses the most recent rolling average of vaccinations, which means that as vaccination numbers pick up, the time needed to hit the 75% threshold will fall.

For example, New York’s target date was briefly pushed out to 17 months this week after a winter blizzard prevented some from getting vaccinated (it’s now back down to 13 months). Likewise, Canada’s vaccination rate dropped by half in recent weeks following reports of delayed vaccine shipments. Based on Canada’s latest rate of inoculations it would take more than 10 years to reach 75% coverage. That might serve as a wake-up call to Canadian politicians and health officials, but it doesn’t mean the country is doomed to a decade of social distancing. Canada has contracts to buy more vaccine doses per person than any other country, and its vaccination rates are expected to climb. Covid Variants Show Need to Lengthen Dose Interval: Dr. Quick The pace is likely to accelerate further as more vaccines become available. Some of the world’s biggest vaccine-manufacturing hubs in India and Mexico are only just getting started. More than 8.5 billion doses of vaccine have been contracted by countries through more than 100 agreements tracked by Bloomberg. Only a third of countries have even begun their vaccination campaigns. Path to Immunity Years to inoculate 75% of the population with a two-dose vaccine at the current pace of shots given Source: Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker A Collective Defense Vaccinations protect against Covid-19 within a few weeks of getting the shots. But if just a few people in a community get vaccinated, the virus can continue to spread unchecked. As more people get the vaccine, groups of people start to build a collective defense against the virus so that isolated sparks of infection burn out instead of spreading into an outbreak. The concept is known as herd immunity. In the scientific community, there are conflicting definitions for when herd immunity is achieved. Is it when enough people are protected that it begins to have a measurable effect on the speed of transmission? That could begin well before 75% of people are fully vaccinated. Others define it as the point when outbreaks can no longer be sustained. For example, even if there’s a cluster of measles cases in an unvaccinated community, herd immunity prevents it from rippling across a country. How We Run the Numbers The vaccines available today require two doses for full vaccination. Our calculations for coverage are based on two doses per person in the population but don't distinguish between first doses or second doses administered. Those breakdowns can distort daily vaccination rates and aren’t available in more than 20% of the countries we’re tracking. A new vaccine by Johnson & Johnson recently showed positive results using a single dose in a large clinical trial. If approved, we’ll adjust the number of doses required proportionate to its market share in each country. The vaccines haven’t been authorized for use in children — those studies are currently underway. Our calculator, like the virus, includes children in the population needed to be protected. Brace Yourself: Long-Haul Travel May Not Get Going Until 2023 One metric Bloomberg’s calculator doesn’t account for is any level of natural immunity that might result from recovering from Covid-19. It’s possible that hard-hit places might require a lower level of vaccination to prevent widespread transmission. While there’s evidence that people who recover from illness do retain some level of natural defenses, it’s unclear how much protection is offered or how long it might last. The vaccine is still recommended for people who have recovered from illness. The calculator is the latest feature from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Tracker. The projections are updated daily and are based on the average daily vaccinations in data gathered from 67 countries and the U.S. states and territories. Countries may be excluded when they are in the earliest stages of vaccinations or if they provide infrequent updates on their vaccination numbers. More than 119 million shots have been given.

More than 748 million doses have been administered across 154 countries, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The latest rate was roughly 17.1 million doses a day. In the U.S., more Americans have received at least one dose than have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began. So far, 179 million doses have been given. In the last week, an average of 3.03 million doses per day were administered. World Map of Vaccinations More than 748 million doses have been administered—enough to vaccinate 4.9% of the global population no data0151020%of population covered Note: “Population covered” divides the doses administered for each vaccine type by the number of doses required for full vaccination. Data gathered from government websites, press conferences, public statements and Bloomberg interviews. Enough doses have now been administered to fully vaccinate about 5% of the global population—but the distribution has been lopsided. Countries with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated 25 times faster than those with the lowest. Uneven Access to Vaccines Note: Vaccine access calculations account for the number of doses needed for full protection; some vaccines require a two-dose regimen while others require just a single dose. Countries are ordered by GDP per capita (PPP). When will life return to normal? While the best vaccines are thought to be 95% effective, it takes a coordinated campaign to stop a pandemic. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious-disease official in the U.S., has said that vaccinating 70% to 85% of the U.S. population would enable a return to normalcy. On a global scale, that’s a daunting level of vaccination. At the current pace of 17.1 million a day, it would take years to achieve a significant level of global immunity. The rate, however, is steadily increasing, and new vaccines by additional manufacturers are coming to market. The Path to Immunity Around the World Note: Immunity calculations take into account the number of doses required and the current rate of administration for each vaccine type. The “daily rate estimate” is a seven-day trailing average; interpolation is used for countries with infrequent updates. Data are from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker. Did we miss a country? Drop us a link Are we bending the curve yet? Israel was first to show that vaccinations were having a nationwide effect. The country has led the world in vaccinations, and by February more than 84% of people ages 70 and older had received two doses. Severe covid cases and deaths declined rapidly. A separate analysis in the U.K. showed similar results. It’s now a life-and-death contest between vaccine and virus. New strains threaten renewed outbreaks. In the early stages of a campaign, the effect of vaccinations are often outweighed by other factors of transmissibility: virus mutations, seasonality, effectiveness of mask use and social distancing. In time, higher vaccination rates should limit the Covid-19 burden around the world. Vaccinations vs. Cases Covid rates have flattened or declined in the countries where enough vaccines have been given to cover at least of the population. Note: “People covered” divides the doses administered for each vaccine type by the number of doses required for full vaccination. Vaccine data from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Tracker. Cases data: Johns Hopkins University. Since the start of the global vaccination campaign, countries have experienced unequal access to vaccines and varying degrees of efficiency in getting shots into people’s arms. Before March, few African nations had received a single shipment of shots. In the U.S., 53.9 doses have been administered for every 100 people. Delivering billions of vaccines to stop the spread of Covid-19 worldwide will be one of the greatest logistical challenges ever undertaken. Race to End the Pandemic Israel leads all countries, with enough vaccinations to cover 56.5% of its population Note: “People covered” divides the doses administered for each vaccine type by the number of doses required for full vaccination. Data from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker Global Vaccination Campaign Note: Population coverage accounts for the number of doses required for each vaccine administered. The daily rate is a 7-day average; for countries that don’t report daily, the last-known average rate is used. U.S. Vaccinations: State by State The U.S. leads the world in total vaccines administered, and more supply is on the way. Drugmakers have promised to deliver enough shots to fully vaccinate 130 million Americans by the end of March and 300 million people by the end of May. That’s more than enough for every adult, and clinical studies in children are underway. Distribution in the U.S. is directed by the federal government. Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, as well as Moderna’s shot both require two doses taken several weeks apart. J&J’s inoculation requires just a single dose. Time to Deliver Vaccine makers pledge 700M doses for the U.S. by the end of July—enough to cover 400M people Vaccines available Delivery targets Projected Source: “Unknown manufacturer” refers to vaccine allocations reported by the White House that are not further identified; the coverage calculation assumes they are two-dose vaccines. Specified allocations are from CDC. Targets are provided by the manufacturers and don’t always align with government forecasts for availability. The introduction of J&J’s one-shot option in March is speeding up vaccinations and making it easier to vaccinate hard-to-reach populations. So far, 114 million Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine—44.4% of the adult population. At least 68.2 million people have completed a vaccination regimen.

Data added after Feb. 20 is from the CDC and includes doses administered by federal entities in state totals. Prior data from the Bloomberg Covid-19 Tracker. It can take several days for counts to be reported through the CDC database. The U.S. hasn’t yet achieved vaccination rates high enough to quell the outbreaks. New Covid variants have driven a surge in cases across the country. Even states with relatively high vaccine coverage, including South Dakota and Massachusetts, have seen their numbers rise. Younger, unvaccinated populations are increasingly viewed as key to heading off a potential fourth wave. New vaccine supplies have allowed some states to open up eligibility to wide swaths of residents. President Joe Biden has said that 90% of American adults will be free to sign up for a shot by April 19. Until recently, eligibility has mostly been based on age, occupation, and underlying medical conditions. U.S. Vaccinations vs. Cases Covid rates have generally flattened or declined in the states where enough vaccines have been given to cover at least of the population. Note: “People covered” divides the doses administered for each vaccine type by the number of doses required for full vaccination. Vaccine data from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Tracker. Cases data: Johns Hopkins University. It takes about two weeks after a final vaccine dose for immunity to fully develop. After that, a person can safely meet indoors with other vaccinated people without wearing masks, according to CDC guidance issued in March. Grandparents can spend time with their grandchildren again. Even for people fully vaccinated, some restrictions remain in place while the virus still circulates across the country. The CDC advises against travel and recommends wearing masks and social distancing while in public. How State Vaccinations Stack Up New Mexico leads all states, with enough vaccinations to cover 35.4% of its populations Note: Two doses are needed for full protection with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, while the J&J shot requires a single dose. Data from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker After focusing first on hospitals and other institutional health-care settings, states have opened access to increasingly larger groups of people. Some states created mass vaccination centers out of sport stadiums, theme parks, convention halls and race tracks. Millions of doses are now being shipped directly to local pharmacies. The vaccines available today are only approved for people over the age of 16. Tests for dosing, safety, and effectiveness are underway in children, and results are expected later this year. Tips and Feedback: Help us improve the Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker The Path to Immunity in the U.S. Note: Vaccinating roughly 70% to 85% of a country’s population would enable a return to normalcy, according to top U.S. infectious disease doctor Anthony Fauci. Immunity calculations take into account the number of doses required and the current rate of administration for each vaccine type. Data are from Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker. U.S. Vaccination Campaign Note: The category entry for Federal Entities isn’t counted in the country total because those vaccinations are already included in relevant state totals. The “Unassigned” entry refers to vaccinations from CDC’s U.S. totals that the agency didn’t assign to a specific state or territory. “Doses administered” figures include all vaccinations within a state, regardless of a person’s residency, while population coverage data only accounts for residency. “Shots used” shows the proportion of administered vaccines compared with the total doses received by a state. Frequently Asked Questions Curious about how we collect our data? Wondering why we made certain decisions for the tracker? We have answers . . . Vaccine Timeline Bloomberg is tracking the development of nine of the globe’s most promising vaccines. A total of seven vaccines are now available for public use, in limited quantities, in at least 154 countries. Nations have poured billions of dollars into developing new vaccine technologies, testing them in thousands of volunteers, scaling up manufacturing, and then bringing them to market in record time. None of these shots, on its own, is enough to inoculate a global population of some 7.8 billion people. But together they represent humanity’s best chance of ending a scourge that has claimed more than 2.6 million lives and triggered global economic calamity.

Cybersecurity Colonial Pipeline Paid Hackers Nearly $5 Million in Ransom By William Turton , Michael Riley , and Jennifer Jacobs May 13, 2021, 10:15 AM EDT Updated on May 13, 2021, 7:01 PM EDT Payment came shortly after attack got underway last week FBI discourages organizations from paying ransom to hackers WATCH: Colonial Pipeline Co. paid Eastern European hackers nearly $5 million last Friday, shortly after a cyberattack against the pipeline got underway. LISTEN TO ARTICLE 3:59 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Colonial Pipeline Co. paid nearly $5 million to Eastern European hackers on Friday, contradicting reports earlier this week that the company had no intention of paying an extortion fee to help restore the country’s largest fuel pipeline, according to two people familiar with the transaction. The company paid the hefty ransom in difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency within hours after the attack, underscoring the immense pressure faced by the Georgia-based operator to get gasoline and jet fuel flowing again to major cities along the Eastern Seaboard, those people said. A third person familiar with the situation said U.S. government officials are aware that Colonial made the payment. Once they received the payment, the hackers provided the operator with a decrypting tool to restore its disabled computer network. The tool was so slow that the company continued using its own backups to help restore the system, one of the people familiar with the company’s efforts said. A representative from Colonial declined to comment. Colonial said it began to resume fuel shipments around 5 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday. When Bloomberg News asked President Joe Biden if he was briefed on the company’s ransom payment, the president paused, then said: “I have no comment on that.” Read More: Biggest U.S. Gasoline Pipeline Restarts After Cyberattack The hackers, which the FBI said are linked to a group called DarkSide, specialize in digital extortion and are believed to be located in Russia or Eastern Europe. Your browser does not support the audio element. LISTEN: Michael Riley discusses the Colonial Pipeline hack with Paul Sweeney and Kailey Leinz on Bloomberg Radio. On Wednesday, media outlets including the Washington Post and Reuters, also based on anonymous sources, reported that the company had no immediate intention of paying the ransom. Ransomware is a type of malware that locks up a victim’s files, which the attackers promise to unlock for a payment. More recently, some ransomware groups have also stolen victims’ data and threatened to release it unless paid -- a kind of double extortion. The FBI discourages organizations from paying ransom to hackers, saying there is no guarantee they will follow through on promises to unlock files. It also provides incentive to other would-be hackers, the agency says. However, Anne Neuberger, the White House’s top cybersecurity official, pointedly declined to say whether companies should pay cyber ransoms at a briefing earlier this week. “We recognize, though, that companies are often in a difficult position if their data is encrypted and they do not have backups and cannot recover the data,” she told reporters Monday. Such guidance provides a quandary for victims who have to weigh the risks of not paying with the costs of lost or exposed records. The reality is that many choose to pay, in part because the costs may be covered if they have cyber-insurance policies. “They had to pay,” said Ondrej Krehel, chief executive officer and founder of digital forensics firm LIFARS and a former cyber expert at Loews Corp., which owns Boardwalk Pipeline. “This is a cyber cancer. You want to die or you want to live? It’s not a situation where you can wait.” Read more about the Colonial Pipeline hack Biden Signs Order to Boost Cybersecurity After Pipeline Hack ’Arm Waving’ Response to Hackers Makes Oil Industry Easy Prey DarkSide Hackers Mint Money With Ransomware Franchise Cyber Sleuths Blunted Pipeline Hack, Choked Data Flow to Russia Pipeline Hack Exposes Brutal Vise of Cyber-Era Extortion Schemes How a Key U.S. Pipeline Got Knocked Out by Hackers: QuickTake Krehel said a $5 million ransom for a pipeline was “very low.” “Ransom is usually around $25 million to $35 million for such a company. I think the threat actor realized they stepped on the wrong company and triggered a massive government response,” he said. A report released last month by a ransomware task force said the amount paid by victims increased by 311% in 2020, reaching about $350 million in cryptocurrency. The average ransom paid by organizations in 2020 was $312,493, according to report. Colonial, which operates the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S., became aware of the hack around May 7 and shut down its operations, which led to fuel shortages and lines at gas stations along the East Coast. — With assistance by Rachel Adams-Heard (Updates with comment from President Biden in fifth paragraph.)

LISTEN TO ARTICLE 3:59 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Colonial Pipeline Co. paid nearly $5 million to Eastern European hackers on Friday, contradicting reports earlier this week that the company had no intention of paying an extortion fee to help restore the country’s largest fuel pipeline, according to two people familiar with the transaction. The company paid the hefty ransom in difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency within hours after the attack, underscoring the immense pressure faced by the Georgia-based operator to get gasoline and jet fuel flowing again to major cities along the Eastern Seaboard, those people said. A third person familiar with the situation said U.S. government officials are aware that Colonial made the payment. Once they received the payment, the hackers provided the operator with a decrypting tool to restore its disabled computer network. The tool was so slow that the company continued using its own backups to help restore the system, one of the people familiar with the company’s efforts said. A representative from Colonial declined to comment. Colonial said it began to resume fuel shipments around 5 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday. When Bloomberg News asked President Joe Biden if he was briefed on the company’s ransom payment, the president paused, then said: “I have no comment on that.” Read More: Biggest U.S. Gasoline Pipeline Restarts After Cyberattack The hackers, which the FBI said are linked to a group called DarkSide, specialize in digital extortion and are believed to be located in Russia or Eastern Europe.

On Wednesday, media outlets including the Washington Post and Reuters, also based on anonymous sources, reported that the company had no immediate intention of paying the ransom. Ransomware is a type of malware that locks up a victim’s files, which the attackers promise to unlock for a payment. More recently, some ransomware groups have also stolen victims’ data and threatened to release it unless paid -- a kind of double extortion. The FBI discourages organizations from paying ransom to hackers, saying there is no guarantee they will follow through on promises to unlock files. It also provides incentive to other would-be hackers, the agency says. However, Anne Neuberger, the White House’s top cybersecurity official, pointedly declined to say whether companies should pay cyber ransoms at a briefing earlier this week. “We recognize, though, that companies are often in a difficult position if their data is encrypted and they do not have backups and cannot recover the data,” she told reporters Monday. Such guidance provides a quandary for victims who have to weigh the risks of not paying with the costs of lost or exposed records. The reality is that many choose to pay, in part because the costs may be covered if they have cyber-insurance policies. “They had to pay,” said Ondrej Krehel, chief executive officer and founder of digital forensics firm LIFARS and a former cyber expert at Loews Corp., which owns Boardwalk Pipeline. “This is a cyber cancer. You want to die or you want to live? It’s not a situation where you can wait.” Read more about the Colonial Pipeline hack Biden Signs Order to Boost Cybersecurity After Pipeline Hack ’Arm Waving’ Response to Hackers Makes Oil Industry Easy Prey DarkSide Hackers Mint Money With Ransomware Franchise Cyber Sleuths Blunted Pipeline Hack, Choked Data Flow to Russia Pipeline Hack Exposes Brutal Vise of Cyber-Era Extortion Schemes How a Key U.S. Pipeline Got Knocked Out by Hackers: QuickTake Krehel said a $5 million ransom for a pipeline was “very low.” “Ransom is usually around $25 million to $35 million for such a company. I think the threat actor realized they stepped on the wrong company and triggered a massive government response,” he said. A report released last month by a ransomware task force said the amount paid by victims increased by 311% in 2020, reaching about $350 million in cryptocurrency. The average ransom paid by organizations in 2020 was $312,493, according to report. Colonial, which operates the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S., became aware of the hack around May 7 and shut down its operations, which led to fuel shortages and lines at gas stations along the East Coast. — With assistance by Rachel Adams-Heard (Updates with comment from President Biden in fifth paragraph.)
