If you have any additional questions, please email customerservice@niagara.ymca.ca Closures Today, the provincial government and health officials announced ongoing measures for the next several weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and stressed the importance of continued social and physical distancing. In alignment with these “extremely serious” directives, our YMCA will not be reopening program sites, as initially planned, on April 6. This situation continues to evolve. It is not easy to predict how long these measures will remain in effect; however, our YMCA will continue to align our operational decisions with the directives of the government and health authorities. We will reopen as soon as it is safe and possible to do so. All of our programs and facilities remain temporarily closed with the exception of our Employment & Immigrant Services department who are servicing our community in a new virtual model. Please bookmark this page and check back here for updates. Automated Payments Information Health, Fitness and Aquatics We are not taking any payments for fees during this closure and we will not resume taking payments until we reopen Current HFA Memberships are effectively on hold While you remain on hold, we will retain your spot in all registered program spots (such as swim lessons, martial arts, etc.) so that you will not have to re-register when we reopen When we reopen we will review your account and adjust your next payment to reflect a credit for the period of closure as soon as possible Licensed Child Care For the month of March all licensed child care families were charged fees up to March 13 A communication was sent to individual families with detailed information Summer Camps We are being optimistic and continuing to accept summer camp registrations in the hopes that summer camp will happen. However we also recognize this is an ever evolving situation. If we are not able to operate summer camp, then we would issue full refunds for all pre-registered summer camps. Employment & Immigrant Services All YMCA Employment & Immigrant Services locations in St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, and Thorold are closed at this time to walk-in traffic. We’ve moved to a modified service model and continue to work with clients and the broader community virtually by e-mail, phone or text during this difficult time.

Our top priority is the health and safety of our members, families, volunteers and staff. Moreover, as a socially responsible community organization we have determined that it is important that we help with public efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, following the announcement that Ontario schools would close we had to make several decisions about many of our YMCA programs. Today, we have decided to close our Health, Fitness and Aquatics centres until April 5 inclusively. At this time, all of our YMCA programs are also suspended until April 5. This decision will also allow our employees to take care of their families while schools and childcare are closed. These are extraordinary circumstances and we thank you for your patience and understanding. The municipal facilities and recreation centres in Niagara Falls, Grimsby, St Catharines, Port Colborne, and Welland have all closed for the same period of time. When we re-open we will review your account and adjust your next payment to reflect a credit for the period of closure. Our YMCA is overwhelmed by the outpouring of support to our organization during these stressful times. Thank you to the many people in our community who have validated our decision to temporarily close. Some members have even offered to donate this month’s membership to the YMCA as a gesture of support. Given that the YMCA is a charity, we can provide you with a tax receipt for your generous donation. Donate Now! Please note: We will also continue to monitor social media and update our website as this COVID-19 situation unfolds.

Our top priority is the health and safety of our members, families, volunteers and staff. Moreover, as a socially responsible community organization we have determined that it is important that we help with public efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, following the announcement that Ontario schools would close we had to make several decisions about many of our YMCA programs. Today, we have decided to close our Health, Fitness and Aquatics centres until April 5 inclusively. At this time, all of our YMCA programs are also suspended until April 5. This decision will also allow our employees to take care of their families while schools and childcare are closed. These are extraordinary circumstances and we thank you for your patience and understanding.

Our top priority is the health and safety of our members, families, volunteers and staff. Moreover, as a socially responsible community organization we have determined that it is important that we help with public efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, following the announcement that Ontario schools would close we had to make several decisions about many of our YMCA programs. Today, we have decided to close our Health, Fitness and Aquatics centres until April 5 inclusively. At this time, all of our YMCA programs are also suspended until April 5. This decision will also allow our employees to take care of their families while schools and childcare are closed. These are extraordinary circumstances and we thank you for your patience and understanding. The municipal facilities and recreation centres in Niagara Falls, Grimsby, St Catharines, Port Colborne, and Welland have all closed for the same period of time. When we re-open we will review your account and adjust your next payment to reflect a credit for the period of closure. Our YMCA is overwhelmed by the outpouring of support to our organization during these stressful times. Thank you to the many people in our community who have validated our decision to temporarily close. Some members have even offered to donate this month’s membership to the YMCA as a gesture of support.

Below you will find answers to some frequently asked questions about our response to the COVID-19 situation and our temporary closures. If you have any additional questions, please email customerservice@niagara.ymca.ca Closures On May 27, the provincial government and health officials announced ongoing measures for the next several weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and stressed the importance of continued social and physical distancing. In alignment with these “extremely serious” directives, our YMCA will not be reopening program sites until we are directed to do so. This situation continues to evolve. It is not easy to predict how long these measures will remain in effect; however, our YMCA will continue to align our operational decisions with the directives of the government and health authorities. We will reopen as soon as it is safe and possible to do so. All of our programs and facilities remain temporarily closed with the exception of our Employment & Immigrant Services department who are servicing our community in a new virtual model. Please bookmark this page and check back here for updates. Health, Fitness & Aquatics We know you’re wondering when you can return to your Y’s Health, Fitness & Aquatics Facility. We are following the direction of local and provincial health authorities carefully to ensure the proper measures are in place before announcing our reopening. You may have heard the recent announcement about pools and we want to let you know that as outlined in the Framework for Reopening the Province, gyms and fitness facilities are included in Stage 3. We understand members can’t wait to get back to the Y—and we can’t wait to have you—but for now, in accordance with the Provincial government’s direction, pools within our fitness facilities will remain closed until we can safely reopen. We’ve established key principles to guide how and when we will reactivate YMCA programs and services, driven by our commitment to your safety and that of our valued staff and volunteers. We will ensure our facilities meet the highest standards for hygiene and safety, including modifying programs and facility spaces to maintain safe physical distancing. Please note all membership fees remain on hold. We will provide updates in the future regarding fee reactivation in advance, along with our reopening details. Thank you for your patience and continued support. We look forward to sharing the details for reopening as soon as we can! Until then, you can enjoy your favourite workouts and activities for all ages online. Child Care The YMCA supports the Ministry of Education’s announcement regarding the reopening of licensed childcare operations in Ontario. We anticipate and require additional information regarding child care regulations and local public health recommendations. Once we have received, reviewed and developed a plan to meet the necessary requirements, we will proceed with a phased approach to reopening in the coming weeks and will reach out to our child care families at that time. We will provide updates regarding our reopening approach as soon as possible and we thank you for your patience. Summer Camps After careful consideration based on the latest COVID-19 developments and recommendations by local and regional health officials, we have decided to cancel our previously scheduled 2020 summer camp programs. All families who have paid camp fees will receive a full refund. Our team will continue to explore alternative options for summer programs that do fit in the physical distancing guidelines to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and we hope to have more information to share on those options in the coming weeks. For more details, please click here.

Our top priority is the health and safety of our members, families, volunteers and staff. Moreover, as a socially responsible community organization we have determined that it is important that we help with public efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, following the announcement that Ontario schools would close we had to make several decisions about many of our YMCA programs. Today, we have decided to close our Health, Fitness and Aquatics centres until April 5 inclusively. At this time, all of our YMCA programs are also suspended until April 5. This decision will also allow our employees to take care of their families while schools and childcare are closed. These are extraordinary circumstances and we thank you for your patience and understanding. The municipal facilities and recreation centres in Niagara Falls, Grimsby, St Catharines, Port Colborne, and Welland have all closed for the same period of time. When we re-open we will review your account and adjust your next payment to reflect a credit for the period of closure. Our YMCA is overwhelmed by the outpouring of support to our organization during these stressful times. Thank you to the many people in our community who have validated our decision to temporarily close. Some members have even offered to donate this month’s membership to the YMCA as a gesture of support. Given that the YMCA is a charity, we can provide you with a tax receipt for your generous donation. Donate Now!

Our top priority is the health and safety of our members, families, volunteers and staff. Moreover, as a socially responsible community organization we have determined that it is important that we help with public efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, following the announcement that Ontario schools would close we had to make several decisions about many of our YMCA programs. Today, we have decided to close our Health, Fitness and Aquatics centres until April 5 inclusively. At this time, all of our YMCA programs are also suspended until April 5. This decision will also allow our employees to take care of their families while schools and childcare are closed. These are extraordinary circumstances and we thank you for your patience and understanding. The municipal facilities and recreation centres in Niagara Falls, Grimsby, St Catharines, Port Colborne, and Welland have all closed for the same period of time. When we re-open we will review your account and adjust your next payment to reflect a credit for the period of closure. Our YMCA is overwhelmed by the outpouring of support to our organization during these stressful times. Thank you to the many people in our community who have validated our decision to temporarily close. Some members have even offered to donate this month’s membership to the YMCA as a gesture of support.

On this page, you will find answers to some frequently asked questions about individual services response to the COVID-19 situation, our temporary closures, and—most recently—planned reactivation. If you have any questions or concerns, please email: customerservice@niagara.ymca.ca Reactivation Plan This plan has been developed with partners in health, research and the private sector working alongside YMCA professionals from coast to coast. We are in the process now of sharing this plan with our staff teams and working through staff training plans. Our No. 1 priority remains the Health and Safety of all staff, volunteers, families, members and community. The Reactivation Plan features some revised and enhanced procedures designed to minimize the potential for virus transmission. The complete plan is available here. COVID-19 Response On May 27, the provincial government and health officials announced ongoing measures for the next several weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and stressed the importance of continued social and physical distancing. In alignment with these “extremely serious” directives, our YMCA will not be reopening program sites until we are directed to do so. Do note that Employment & Immigrant Services and EarlyON are servicing the community in a new virtual model. This situation continues to evolve. It is not easy to predict how long these measures will remain in effect; however, our YMCA will continue to align our operational decisions with the directives of the government and health authorities. Please bookmark this page and check back here for updates on individual programs. Health, Fitness & Aquatics We know you’re wondering when you can return to your Y’s Health, Fitness & Aquatics Facility and we can’t wait to have you; but for now, in accordance with the Provincial government’s direction, pools within our fitness facilities will remain closed until we can safely reopen. Our HFA operations cannot restart until after the province declares Phase Three of reopening. We will apply a phased approach to restarting our programming. Rest assured we are working closely with local public health authorities on our planning for each area of the YMCA. We’ve established key principles to guide how and when we will reactivate YMCA programs and services; we are driven by our commitment to your safety and that of our valued staff and volunteers. We will ensure our facilities meet the highest standards for hygiene and safety; including modifying programs and facility spaces to maintain safe physical distancing. Please note all membership fees remain on hold. We will provide updates in the future regarding fee reactivation in advance, along with our reopening details. Thank you for your patience and continued support. We look forward to sharing the details for reopening as soon as we can! Until then, you can enjoy your favourite workouts and activities for all ages online. Child Care As we move into our phased approach to reopening child care we wanted to share with you some important updates. Licensed Child Care is starting to prepare to reopen licensed Pre School centres. We want to thank our current child care families for sharing your intentions and needs for child care through our electronic Child Care Intention Forms. We have been busy reviewing the Provincial Guidelines in consultation with Public Heath to ensure that all necessary requirements are understood and addressed as we remain focused on ensuring safety for families, children and educators. Our first phase of reopening will take place with our licensed preschool Child Care Centres. For more information, click here. EarlyON YMCA EarlyON Child and Family Centres are currently closed however our Program Facilitators continue to provide services for children, parents and caregivers virtually.

Summer Camps After careful consideration based on the latest COVID-19 developments and recommendations by local and regional health officials, we have decided to cancel our previously scheduled 2020 summer camp programs. All families who have paid camp fees will receive a full refund. For more details, please click here. The YMCA of Niagara has been exploring Day Camp models and options over the past many weeks. As a result of limited funding, resources and required regulations, the YMCA is not able to offer a traditional Day Camp program for the summer of 2020. This has been a difficult process and decision, and we hope to be able to offer Winter Break, March Break and Summer Camps in the future. As of July 6, virtual Day Camp programming is available through the YCamp At Home and we encourage you to access a number of these exciting camp resources. Automated Payments Information Health, Fitness and Aquatics We are not taking any payments for fees during this closure and we will not resume taking payments until we reopen Current HFA Memberships are effectively on hold While you remain on hold, we will retain your spot in all registered program spots (such as swim lessons, martial arts, etc.) so that you will not have to re-register when we reopen When we reopen we will review your account and adjust your next payment to reflect a credit for the period of closure as soon as possible Licensed Child Care For the month of March all licensed child care families were charged fees up to March 13 A communication was also sent to individual families with detailed information Employment & Immigrant Services All YMCA Employment & Immigrant Services locations in St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, and Thorold are closed at this time to walk-in traffic.

Our top priority is the health and safety of our members, families, volunteers and staff. Moreover, as a socially responsible community organization we have determined that it is important that we help with public efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, following the announcement that Ontario schools would close we had to make several decisions about many of our YMCA programs. Today, we have decided to close our Health, Fitness and Aquatics centres until April 5 inclusively. At this time, all of our YMCA programs are also suspended until April 5. This decision will also allow our employees to take care of their families while schools and childcare are closed. These are extraordinary circumstances and we thank you for your patience and understanding. The municipal facilities and recreation centres in Niagara Falls, Grimsby, St Catharines, Port Colborne, and Welland have all closed for the same period of time. When we re-open we will review your account and adjust your next payment to reflect a credit for the period of closure. Our YMCA is overwhelmed by the outpouring of support to our organization during these stressful times. Thank you to the many people in our community who have validated our decision to temporarily close. Some members have even offered to donate this month’s membership to the YMCA as a gesture of support. Given that the YMCA is a charity, we can provide you with a tax receipt for your generous donation. Please Consider Donating Please note: We will also continue to monitor social media and update our website as this COVID-19 situation unfolds.

We are now open to members at: Niagara West Port Colborne St. Catharines The safety of our staff, members and community is our number one priority. We have a number of measures in place to ensure a safe return to the YMCA which also include requirements for masks, physical distancing signage, enhanced sanitization and cleaning schedules. Staged approach to Reactivation Our SUPERPOWER at the YMCA is our ability to impact the health and well-being of the community through the unique and knowledgeable expertise of our team members. People are our most valuable assets! The pandemic has placed significant pressure on most charities across the country and locally, including our YMCA in Niagara. As we struggle financially to emerge from the economic impacts of this pandemic, we must continue to carefully balance bringing services back while managing financial pressures. To this end, we have intentionally applied a staged approach with our Reactivation Plan and we have not reopened all of our locations and programs at once. We know people may be disappointed by this and many have questions about the timing of locations and programs that have not yet been reactivated. Partnerships in Niagara Falls and Welland We enjoy excellent partnerships with the City of Niagara Falls and our long-standing partners in Welland. It is our expressed desire to continue to work alongside these partners to create a sustainable and vibrant community presence in each location. As a part of this strategy, the Board of Directors of the YMCA of Niagara recently appointed a new Interim CEO, Steve Boone, and a Strategic Advisor, Suzanne Johnston, to lead the YMCA of Niagara through this challenging time. We know that our teams and members have many questions that remain unanswered about the next stages of reactivation and we ask for your patience and consideration as we move forward. In the meantime, we welcome as many of you as possible to reactivate your membership and try out services at a YMCA close to you. Please click here to make us part of your lives again! If you are able, please consider making a charitable donation. Every little bit makes a difference and we are #strongertogether. We will keep you apprised of new developments and next steps as we work our way through the creation of sustainable models for future delivery across the region.

We are now open to members at: Niagara West Port Colborne St. Catharines The safety of our staff, members and community is our number one priority. We have a number of measures in place to ensure a safe return to the YMCA which also include requirements for masks, physical distancing signage, enhanced sanitization and cleaning schedules. Staged approach to Reactivation Our SUPERPOWER at the YMCA is our ability to impact the health and well-being of the community through the unique and knowledgeable expertise of our team members. People are our most valuable assets! The pandemic has placed significant pressure on most charities across the country and locally, including our YMCA in Niagara. As we struggle financially to emerge from the economic impacts of this pandemic, we must continue to carefully balance bringing services back while managing financial pressures. To this end, we have intentionally applied a staged approach with our Reactivation Plan and we have not reopened all of our locations and programs at once. We know people may be disappointed by this and many have questions about the timing of locations and programs that have not yet been reactivated. Partnerships in Niagara Falls and Welland We enjoy excellent partnerships with the City of Niagara Falls and our long-standing partners in Welland. It is our expressed desire to continue to work alongside these partners to create a sustainable and vibrant community presence in each location. As a part of this strategy, the Board of Directors of the YMCA of Niagara recently appointed a new Interim CEO, Steve Boone, and a Strategic Advisor, Suzanne Johnston, to lead the YMCA of Niagara through this challenging time. We know that our teams and members have many questions that remain unanswered about the next stages of reactivation and we ask for your patience and consideration as we move forward. In the meantime, we welcome as many of you as possible to reactivate your membership and try out services at a YMCA close to you. Please click here to make us part of your lives again! If you are able, please consider making a charitable donation. Every little bit makes a difference and we are #strongertogether. We will keep you apprised of new developments and next steps as we work our way through the creation of sustainable models for future delivery across the region.

All indoor fitness classes require social distancing of 3 metres. In an effort to adhere to these new Provincial Standards, we are readjusting our class sizes, updating our social distancing signage, and ensuring that our daily temporary shut-down for cleaning and sterilization of workout areas continues for the health and safety of our members and staff. EZ Facility To help manage and maintain numbers within the building—and to ensure there’s a spot ready just for you—members must book their workout in advance using EZ Facility. For the safety of our members and staff, there are limits to our capacity. Due to this, we ask that you limit your workout to 60 minutes. The fitness centre, courts, fitness classes and lane swims are available for booking using EZ Facility. Follow these steps if you are unfamiliar with EZ Facility: Click here to request your personal login for EZ Facility (if you don’t already have one) so you can start booking your workouts To book your session, go to the EZ Facility page for your YMCA of Niagara location: Niagara West YMCA Port Colborne YMCA Walker Family YMCA Enter your log-in information Click the “Book Sessions” tab in the left navigation bar, take a look at the available classes and activities Select “Book” beside your choice You will then be sent a confirmation email with your booking Please note: Registration opens seven days/one week in advance of the scheduled workout and/or fitness class. October 13 update: Niagara Falls and Welland YMCA OF NIAGARA REOPENING PLAN UPDATE The YMCA of Niagara has turned on the lights and welcomed our staff and members back to three of our Health, Fitness and Aquatics Centres to date. We are now open to members at: Niagara West Port Colborne St. Catharines The safety of our staff, members and community is our number one priority. We have a number of measures in place to ensure a safe return to the YMCA which also include requirements for masks, physical distancing signage, enhanced sanitization and cleaning schedules. Staged approach to Reactivation Our SUPERPOWER at the YMCA is our ability to impact the health and well-being of the community through the unique and knowledgeable expertise of our team members. People are our most valuable assets! The pandemic has placed significant pressure on most charities across the country and locally, including our YMCA in Niagara. As we struggle financially to emerge from the economic impacts of this pandemic, we must continue to carefully balance bringing services back while managing financial pressures. To this end, we have intentionally applied a staged approach with our Reactivation Plan and we have not reopened all of our locations and programs at once. We know people may be disappointed by this and many have questions about the timing of locations and programs that have not yet been reactivated. Partnerships in Niagara Falls and Welland We enjoy excellent partnerships with the City of Niagara Falls and our long-standing partners in Welland. It is our expressed desire to continue to work alongside these partners to create a sustainable and vibrant community presence in each location. As a part of this strategy, the Board of Directors of the YMCA of Niagara recently appointed a new Interim CEO, Steve Boone, and a Strategic Advisor, Suzanne Johnston, to lead the YMCA of Niagara through this challenging time. We know that our teams and members have many questions that remain unanswered about the next stages of reactivation and we ask for your patience and consideration as we move forward. In the meantime, we welcome as many of you as possible to reactivate your membership and try out services at a YMCA close to you. Please click here to make us part of your lives again! If you are able, please consider making a charitable donation. Every little bit makes a difference and we are #strongertogether. We will keep you apprised of new developments and next steps as we work our way through the creation of sustainable models for future delivery across the region.

We know people may be disappointed by this and many have questions about the timing of locations and programs that have not yet been reactivated. Partnerships in Niagara Falls and Welland We enjoy excellent partnerships with the City of Niagara Falls and our long-standing partners in Welland. It is our expressed desire to continue to work alongside these partners to create a sustainable and vibrant community presence in each location. As a part of this strategy, the Board of Directors of the YMCA of Niagara recently appointed a new Interim CEO, Steve Boone, and a Strategic Advisor, Suzanne Johnston, to lead the YMCA of Niagara through this challenging time. We know that our teams and members have many questions that remain unanswered about the next stages of reactivation and we ask for your patience and consideration as we move forward. In the meantime, we welcome as many of you as possible to reactivate your membership and try out services at a YMCA close to you. Please click here to make us part of your lives again!

All indoor fitness classes require social distancing of 3 metres. In an effort to adhere to these new Provincial Standards, we are readjusting our class sizes, updating our social distancing signage, and ensuring that our daily temporary shut-down for cleaning and sterilization of workout areas continues for the health and safety of our members and staff. EZ Facility To help manage and maintain numbers within the building—and to ensure there’s a spot ready just for you—members must book their workout in advance using EZ Facility. For the safety of our members and staff, there are limits to our capacity. Due to this, we ask that you limit your workout to 60 minutes. The fitness centre, courts, fitness classes and lane swims are available for booking using EZ Facility. Follow these steps if you are unfamiliar with EZ Facility: Click here to request your personal login for EZ Facility (if you don’t already have one) so you can start booking your workouts To book your session, go to the EZ Facility page for your YMCA of Niagara location: Niagara West YMCA Port Colborne YMCA Walker Family YMCA Enter your log-in information Click the “Book Sessions” tab in the left navigation bar, take a look at the available classes and activities Select “Book” beside your choice You will then be sent a confirmation email with your booking Please note: Registration opens seven days/one week in advance of the scheduled workout and/or fitness class. October 13 update: Niagara Falls and Welland YMCA OF NIAGARA REOPENING PLAN UPDATE The YMCA of Niagara has turned on the lights and welcomed our staff and members back to three of our Health, Fitness and Aquatics Centres to date. We are now open to members at: Niagara West Port Colborne St. Catharines The safety of our staff, members and community is our number one priority. We have a number of measures in place to ensure a safe return to the YMCA which also include requirements for masks, physical distancing signage, enhanced sanitization and cleaning schedules. Staged approach to Reactivation Our SUPERPOWER at the YMCA is our ability to impact the health and well-being of the community through the unique and knowledgeable expertise of our team members. People are our most valuable assets! The pandemic has placed significant pressure on most charities across the country and locally, including our YMCA in Niagara. As we struggle financially to emerge from the economic impacts of this pandemic, we must continue to carefully balance bringing services back while managing financial pressures. To this end, we have intentionally applied a staged approach with our Reactivation Plan and we have not reopened all of our locations and programs at once. We know people may be disappointed by this and many have questions about the timing of locations and programs that have not yet been reactivated. Partnerships in Niagara Falls and Welland We enjoy excellent partnerships with the City of Niagara Falls and our long-standing partners in Welland. It is our expressed desire to continue to work alongside these partners to create a sustainable and vibrant community presence in each location. As a part of this strategy, the Board of Directors of the YMCA of Niagara recently appointed a new Interim CEO, Steve Boone, and a Strategic Advisor, Suzanne Johnston, to lead the YMCA of Niagara through this challenging time. We know that our teams and members have many questions that remain unanswered about the next stages of reactivation and we ask for your patience and consideration as we move forward. In the meantime, we welcome as many of you as possible to reactivate your membership and try out services at a YMCA close to you. Please click here to make us part of your lives again!

The location, which opened in 2005, has been temporarily closed since mid-March when the YMCA of Niagara shut down all five of its health, fitness and aquatics centres, in accordance with government directives related to the pandemic. YMCA leadership has been reviewing operations of all centres since the spring and has taken a phased approach to reopening individual locations based on safety, local community interest in YMCA programming, and financial viability. YMCA health, fitness and aquatics locations in St. Catharines, Niagara West (Grimsby), Port Colborne and Welland had reopened for a period of time prior to the most recent provincial lockdown on December 26, 2020. YMCA members from the Niagara Falls location have been contacted individually via email today. The economic impact of the pandemic has had a devastating impact on YMCAs across the country including the YMCA of Niagara. The Niagara Falls location was already experiencing significant membership losses prior to the pandemic and YMCA projections indicate membership numbers will continue to decline. Relative to the size of the community, delivering YMCA programs and services in a facility as large as the MacBain Community Centre is no longer economically sustainable. “We are saddened that this closure will affect many members, staff and supporters in the community who have been part of our YMCA family for many years,” said Mike Watt, Chair of YMCA of Niagara’s Board of Directors. “However, as a responsible charity with very limited reserves, we cannot compromise our long-term ability to serve Niagara by continuing to operate facilities that are not financially viable. We are very appreciative of our partnership with the City of Niagara Falls and remain committed to the Niagara Falls community.” Mayor Jim Diodati stated that “The YMCA at MacBain Community Centre has been a cornerstone of our community for the past 15 years. Thousands of people have learned to swim in the pool, improved their fitness at classes, brought their kids to programs and enjoyed connecting with their neighbours there. The City has had a long and positive partnership with the YMCA, and City staff and Council worked hard with YMCA leadership to find a mutually beneficial way for services to continue, but in the end, there was no financially viable way to do so.” The Mayor added, “Reinvention is about recognizing change and making a decision to adapt. In the near future, the City of Niagara Falls will be entertaining Expressions of Interest (EOI) for new opportunities to utilize the former YMCA space in this City-owned facility, which includes the pool, gymnasium, fitness studios, racquet courts and indoor track.” The YMCA of Niagara will continue to operate programs and services in licensed child care, camp, community outreach, employment and immigrant services in other locations in Niagara Falls, and will continue to explore new, sustainable ways to provide YMCA health and fitness programs locally and throughout the region. Unfortunately, this closure will impact a number of staff and we hope to have the opportunity to rehire staff in the future as we consider new opportunities to reactivate programs and services.

The location, which opened in 2005, has been temporarily closed since mid-March when the YMCA of Niagara shut down all five of its health, fitness and aquatics centres, in accordance with government directives related to the pandemic. YMCA leadership has been reviewing operations of all centres since the spring and has taken a phased approach to reopening individual locations based on safety, local community interest in YMCA programming, and financial viability. YMCA health, fitness and aquatics locations in St. Catharines, Niagara West (Grimsby), Port Colborne and Welland had reopened for a period of time prior to the most recent provincial lockdown on December 26, 2020. YMCA members from the Niagara Falls location have been contacted individually via email today. The economic impact of the pandemic has had a devastating impact on YMCAs across the country including the YMCA of Niagara. The Niagara Falls location was already experiencing significant membership losses prior to the pandemic and YMCA projections indicate membership numbers will continue to decline. Relative to the size of the community, delivering YMCA programs and services in a facility as large as the MacBain Community Centre is no longer economically sustainable. “We are saddened that this closure will affect many members, staff and supporters in the community who have been part of our YMCA family for many years,” said Mike Watt, Chair of YMCA of Niagara’s Board of Directors. “However, as a responsible charity with very limited reserves, we cannot compromise our long-term ability to serve Niagara by continuing to operate facilities that are not financially viable. We are very appreciative of our partnership with the City of Niagara Falls and remain committed to the Niagara Falls community.” Mayor Jim Diodati stated that “The YMCA at MacBain Community Centre has been a cornerstone of our community for the past 15 years. Thousands of people have learned to swim in the pool, improved their fitness at classes, brought their kids to programs and enjoyed connecting with their neighbours there. The City has had a long and positive partnership with the YMCA, and City staff and Council worked hard with YMCA leadership to find a mutually beneficial way for services to continue, but in the end, there was no financially viable way to do so.” The Mayor added, “Reinvention is about recognizing change and making a decision to adapt. In the near future, the City of Niagara Falls will be entertaining Expressions of Interest (EOI) for new opportunities to utilize the former YMCA space in this City-owned facility, which includes the pool, gymnasium, fitness studios, racquet courts and indoor track.” The YMCA of Niagara will continue to operate programs and services in licensed child care, camp, community outreach, employment and immigrant services in other locations in Niagara Falls, and will continue to explore new, sustainable ways to provide YMCA health and fitness programs locally and throughout the region. Unfortunately, this closure will impact a number of staff and we hope to have the opportunity to rehire staff in the future as we consider new opportunities to reactivate programs and services.

Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches will be designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health. Click to see the recent announcement made by the Niagara Region regarding COVID-19 vaccination sites: Niagara Region names 11 clinic sites to vaccinate 80-plus population News sources: Niagara This Week St. Catharines Standard Niagara Falls Review Welland Tribune × Click here for an important update regarding our Walker Family YMCA operations. Mike Watt, Board Chair, spoke to Newstalk 610 CKTB on March 10; the interview is available online. Niagara Region moving back to Red Zone What this means for the YMCA of Niagara On February 26, the Premier announced the transition of Niagara Region from the Grey (Lockdown) status to the Red (Control) status, effective March 1. We know people may be wondering if this means we will be reopening our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities to in-person visits on March 1. While the Red (Control) stage of the framework permits the operation of fitness facilities, there are specific restrictions and limits to attendance that must be in place. Our YMCA leadership team has reviewed these restrictions, and also assessed the messages from Public Health requesting people remain vigilant and cautious in preventing community transmission of the virus, especially as new variables are emerging with less understood variants. At this time, we will not be resuming in-person programs at any of our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities. We will continue to monitor the situation locally, and apply three priorities to inform our decisions related to our Health, Fitness, and Aquatics operations: Health and safety of our staff and members Community interest in attending in-person programming Financial viability as a responsible charity Stay active with our Online Programs Our Online Group Fitness Package has expanded and includes more than 40 fitness classes per week, plus a wide range of programs that can be accessed safely from the comfort of your home.

Online Personal Training Whether you’re just getting started, looking to get active, or need a mental break, our YMCA-certified Personal Trainers provide a customized plan, supervise your progress and motivate you to succeed. We now offer an Online Personal Training program that can be accessed safely from the comfort of your home. Kid Fit To keep the children in your family active we have converted our popular YMCA Kid Fit program to a live experience. This program is designed for children and youth aged 3 to 12 years. YMCA Kid Fit Online takes the best of all of our previous activity streams and combines them in a 30 or 45 minute class. Each class is action-packed and will include a mix of Cardio, Yoga and GameOn activities. We will continue to apply a staged and informed approach to the resumption of in-person programs and services and we will continue to provide updates as local conditions unfold. Membership Payments We will pause taking future payments from HFA members while we are closed and memberships will be placed on HOLD. Once we reopen, adjustment can be made to accounts. More Virtual Programming We encourage you to participate in our virtual programming during this closure: Please try our free online workouts led by YMCA certified fitness instructors For members living with chronic disease or other health and wellness challenges, please visit our free YHealth portal for virtual health management programs instructed by professionals and YMCA certified fitness instructors For your mental health, we offer a variety of free seminars from mental health professionals Watch out for a variety of new child and youth virtual program offering (available in January) Child Care All YMCA of Niagara Child Care programs are currently operating.

Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches will be designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health. Click to see the recent announcement made by the Niagara Region regarding COVID-19 vaccination sites: Niagara Region names 11 clinic sites to vaccinate 80-plus population News sources: Niagara This Week St. Catharines Standard Niagara Falls Review Welland Tribune × Click here for an important update regarding our Walker Family YMCA operations. Mike Watt, Board Chair, spoke to Newstalk 610 CKTB on March 10; the interview is available online. Niagara Region moving back to Red Zone What this means for the YMCA of Niagara On February 26, the Premier announced the transition of Niagara Region from the Grey (Lockdown) status to the Red (Control) status, effective March 1. We know people may be wondering if this means we will be reopening our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities to in-person visits on March 1. While the Red (Control) stage of the framework permits the operation of fitness facilities, there are specific restrictions and limits to attendance that must be in place. Our YMCA leadership team has reviewed these restrictions, and also assessed the messages from Public Health requesting people remain vigilant and cautious in preventing community transmission of the virus, especially as new variables are emerging with less understood variants. At this time, we will not be resuming in-person programs at any of our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities. We will continue to monitor the situation locally, and apply three priorities to inform our decisions related to our Health, Fitness, and Aquatics operations: Health and safety of our staff and members Community interest in attending in-person programming Financial viability as a responsible charity Stay active with our Online Programs Our Online Group Fitness Package has expanded and includes more than 40 fitness classes per week, plus a wide range of programs that can be accessed safely from the comfort of your home. Please check the schedules and class descriptions online, and learn how to take part in your first trial class for FREE! Online Personal Training Whether you’re just getting started, looking to get active, or need a mental break, our YMCA-certified Personal Trainers provide a customized plan, supervise your progress and motivate you to succeed. We now offer an Online Personal Training program that can be accessed safely from the comfort of your home. Kid Fit To keep the children in your family active we have converted our popular YMCA Kid Fit program to a live experience. This program is designed for children and youth aged 3 to 12 years. YMCA Kid Fit Online takes the best of all of our previous activity streams and combines them in a 30 or 45 minute class. Each class is action-packed and will include a mix of Cardio, Yoga and GameOn activities. We will continue to apply a staged and informed approach to the resumption of in-person programs and services and we will continue to provide updates as local conditions unfold. Membership Payments We will pause taking future payments from HFA members while we are closed and memberships will be placed on HOLD. Once we reopen, adjustment can be made to accounts. More Virtual Programming We encourage you to participate in our virtual programming during this closure: Please try our free online workouts led by YMCA certified fitness instructors For members living with chronic disease or other health and wellness challenges, please visit our free YHealth portal for virtual health management programs instructed by professionals and YMCA certified fitness instructors For your mental health, we offer a variety of free seminars from mental health professionals Watch out for a variety of new child and youth virtual program offering (available in January) Child Care All YMCA of Niagara Child Care programs are currently operating.

Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches will be designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health.

We know people may be wondering if this means we will be reopening our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities to in-person visits on March 1. While the Red (Control) stage of the framework permits the operation of fitness facilities, there are specific restrictions and limits to attendance that must be in place. Our YMCA leadership team has reviewed these restrictions, and also assessed the messages from Public Health requesting people remain vigilant and cautious in preventing community transmission of the virus, especially as new variables are emerging with less understood variants. At this time, we will not be resuming in-person programs at any of our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities. We will continue to monitor the situation locally, and apply three priorities to inform our decisions related to our Health, Fitness, and Aquatics operations: Health and safety of our staff and members Community interest in attending in-person programming Financial viability as a responsible charity Stay active with our Online Programs Our Online Group Fitness Package has expanded and includes more than 40 fitness classes per week, plus a wide range of programs that can be accessed safely from the comfort of your home.

Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches will be designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health. Niagara Region names 11 clinic sites to vaccinate 80-plus population News sources: Niagara This Week St. Catharines Standard Niagara Falls Review Welland Tribune Niagara Region moving back to Red Zone What this means for the YMCA of Niagara On February 26, the Premier announced the transition of Niagara Region from the Grey (Lockdown) status to the Red (Control) status, effective March 1. We know people may be wondering if this means we will be reopening our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities to in-person visits on March 1. While the Red (Control) stage of the framework permits the operation of fitness facilities, there are specific restrictions and limits to attendance that must be in place. Our YMCA leadership team has reviewed these restrictions, and also assessed the messages from Public Health requesting people remain vigilant and cautious in preventing community transmission of the virus, especially as new variables are emerging with less understood variants. At this time, we will not be resuming in-person programs at any of our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities. We will continue to monitor the situation locally, and apply three priorities to inform our decisions related to our Health, Fitness, and Aquatics operations: Health and safety of our staff and members Community interest in attending in-person programming Financial viability as a responsible charity Stay active with our Online Programs Our Online Group Fitness Package has expanded and includes more than 40 fitness classes per week, plus a wide range of programs that can be accessed safely from the comfort of your home.

We continue to offer a variety of other virtual programs including online fitness classes, personal training, EarlyON programs, Kid Fit, Youth Action, Employment Services, Immigrant Services and more. Our YMCA leadership team is constantly assessing the messages from Public Health requesting people remain vigilant and cautious in preventing community transmission of the virus, especially as new variables are emerging with less understood variants. At this time, we will not be resuming in-person programs at any of our YMCA of Niagara fitness facilities. We will continue to monitor the situation locally, and apply three priorities to inform our decisions related to our Health, Fitness, and Aquatics operations: Health and safety of our staff and members Community interest in attending in-person programming Financial viability as a responsible charity Stay active with our Online Programs Our Online Group Fitness Package has expanded and includes more than 40 fitness classes per week, plus a wide range of programs that can be accessed safely from the comfort of your home.

Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches are designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health. News sources: Niagara This Week St. Catharines Standard Niagara Falls Review Welland Tribune A Message from CEO Steven Chuang As you may be aware the province has announced that Ontario will move to Stage Three of the reactivation framework effective Friday, July 16, 2021, see Ontario Provincial Framework. Over the past several months our YMCA has been actively delivering in-person Preschool and Toddler Licensed Child Care, along with a range of virtual programs for children, youth and families including EarlyON, Health and Fitness and Employment and Immigrant Services Programs, as well as, a variety of Community Outreach Programs. These were featured in our last edition of our Healthier Together Newsletter. We have also resumed in person programming this summer including: Summer Day Camp, Outdoor Fitness Programs and Kid Fit. All of these activities are in full-swing and we are delighted to apply high standards in health and safety guidelines as we have started to bring people back to our YMCA in-person! Our Health and Fitness branches continue to proudly host vaccination clinics in Port Colborne, Welland and Grimsby. We remain in close contact with our partners at Niagara Region Public Health to monitor their ongoing needs for the use of our spaces. We are carefully reviewing the regulations and restrictions of the recent Stage Three of reactivation in Ontario announcement to determine what additional programs and services may be possible to expand later this month. I want to assure you that our YMCA has been carefully preparing for the expansion of in-person programs and activities that may be permitted in Stage Three for some time. There will be a continuation of important health and safety protocols for any in-person gatherings. We also are evaluating the site-specific attendance or capacity restrictions that we will need to follow. We will continue to apply a staged approach to program reactivation this summer as we must ensure that our program reactivation is compatible with our vaccine clinics, summer day camp and outdoor fitness programming. We consistently apply the same three principles to each reactivation decision: The health and safety of all, community interest and demand for specific program options and responsible financial management to scale our program delivery to meet the needs of our members. Please stay tuned to our website and social media channels for more information about the site-specific programs we will offer as Stage Three unfolds. More information will follow over the next two weeks.

Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches are designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health. News sources: Niagara This Week St. Catharines Standard Niagara Falls Review Welland Tribune A Message from CEO Steven Chuang As you may be aware the province has announced that Ontario will move to Stage Three of the reactivation framework effective Friday, July 16, 2021, see Ontario Provincial Framework. Over the past several months our YMCA has been actively delivering in-person Preschool and Toddler Licensed Child Care, along with a range of virtual programs for children, youth and families including EarlyON, Health and Fitness and Employment and Immigrant Services Programs, as well as, a variety of Community Outreach Programs. These were featured in our last edition of our Healthier Together Newsletter. We have also resumed in person programming this summer including: Summer Day Camp, Outdoor Fitness Programs and Kid Fit. All of these activities are in full-swing and we are delighted to apply high standards in health and safety guidelines as we have started to bring people back to our YMCA in-person! Our Health and Fitness branches continue to proudly host vaccination clinics in Port Colborne, Welland and Grimsby. We remain in close contact with our partners at Niagara Region Public Health to monitor their ongoing needs for the use of our spaces. We are carefully reviewing the regulations and restrictions of the recent Stage Three of reactivation in Ontario announcement to determine what additional programs and services may be possible to expand later this month. I want to assure you that our YMCA has been carefully preparing for the expansion of in-person programs and activities that may be permitted in Stage Three for some time. There will be a continuation of important health and safety protocols for any in-person gatherings. We also are evaluating the site-specific attendance or capacity restrictions that we will need to follow. We will continue to apply a staged approach to program reactivation this summer as we must ensure that our program reactivation is compatible with our vaccine clinics, summer day camp and outdoor fitness programming. We consistently apply the same three principles to each reactivation decision: The health and safety of all, community interest and demand for specific program options and responsible financial management to scale our program delivery to meet the needs of our members. Please stay tuned to our website and social media channels for more information about the site-specific programs we will offer as Stage Three unfolds. More information will follow over the next two weeks.

What this means for the YMCA of Niagara As previously announced, our YMCA of Niagara is proudly hosting large vaccination clinics in our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre (Welland) locations and these clinics are expected to continue to operate this summer. We are now operating Summer Day Camp and Outdoor Fitness programming at most of our locations; so, we want to let you know that we will not be resuming indoor, in-person Health, Fitness and Aquatics programming in Port Colborne, Niagara West, Walker, or Welland at this time. Historically, summer in Niagara is a time people like to be active outside, and we are focused on providing a wide range of in-person, outdoor health and wellness programs for all ages across the Region. These programs currently include: Personal Training (in-person and online) Outdoor Group Fitness Kid Fit Backyard Swim Summer Camp We look forward to adding more indoor program options as more people prepare to come back inside and return to indoor activities later this summer and fall. If you prefer to participate from the comfort of your home, check out our full slate of online fitness programs: click here to view schedules; you may also be eligible for a free trial class. We also continue to offer a variety of other virtual programs, including EarlyON, Community Initiatives, Employment Services, Immigrant Services and more. We will continue to apply a staged approach to the reactivation of in-person programming at the YMCA. While the vaccination clinics operate this summer, we will work with Niagara Region Public Health to identify additional YMCA Programs and Services we can resume that are compatible with the important activity of these clinics. Please stay tuned to our website for more information as Stage 3 unfolds. × As vaccinations ramp up, the YMCA of Niagara is proud to announce that all three of our Health, Fitness and Aquatics (HFA) facilities are in use as vaccination sites. Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches are designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health.

Over the past several months our YMCA has been actively delivering in-person Infant, Preschool and Toddler Licensed Child Care, along with a range of virtual programs for infant, children, youth and families including EarlyON, Health and Fitness and Employment and Immigrant Services Programs, as well as, a variety of Community Outreach Programs. These were featured in our last edition of our Healthier Together Newsletter. We have also resumed in person programming this summer including: Summer Day Camp, Adventure Club, Outdoor Group Fitness Programs and Kid Fit. All of these activities are in full-swing and we are delighted to apply high standards in health and safety guidelines as we have started to bring people back to our YMCA in-person! Our Health and Fitness branches continue to proudly host vaccination clinics in Port Colborne, Welland and Grimsby. We remain in close contact with our partners at Niagara Region Public Health to monitor their ongoing needs for the use of our spaces. We are carefully reviewing the regulations and restrictions of the recent Stage Three of reactivation in Ontario announcement to determine what additional programs and services may be possible to expand later this month. We will continue to apply a staged approach to program reactivation this summer as we must ensure that our program reactivation is compatible with our vaccine clinics, summer day camp and outdoor fitness programming. We consistently apply the same three principles to each reactivation decision: the health and safety of all, community interest and demand for specific program options and responsible financial management to scale our program delivery to meet the needs of our members.

What this means for the YMCA of Niagara As previously announced, our YMCA of Niagara is proudly hosting large vaccination clinics in our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre (Welland) locations and these clinics are expected to continue to operate this summer. We are now operating Summer Day Camp and Outdoor Fitness programming at most of our locations; so, we want to let you know that we will not be resuming indoor, in-person Health, Fitness and Aquatics programming in Port Colborne, Niagara West, Walker, or Welland at this time. Historically, summer in Niagara is a time people like to be active outside, and we are focused on providing a wide range of in-person, outdoor health and wellness programs for all ages across the Region. These programs currently include: Personal Training (in-person and online) Outdoor Group Fitness Kid Fit Backyard Swim Summer Camp We look forward to adding more indoor program options as more people prepare to come back inside and return to indoor activities later this summer and fall. If you prefer to participate from the comfort of your home, check out our full slate of online fitness programs: click here to view schedules; you may also be eligible for a free trial class. We also continue to offer a variety of other virtual programs, including EarlyON, Community Initiatives, Employment Services, Immigrant Services and more. We will continue to apply a staged approach to the reactivation of in-person programming at the YMCA. While the vaccination clinics operate this summer, we will work with Niagara Region Public Health to identify additional YMCA Programs and Services we can resume that are compatible with the important activity of these clinics. Please stay tuned to our website for more information as Stage 3 unfolds. × As vaccinations ramp up, the YMCA of Niagara is proud to announce that all three of our Health, Fitness and Aquatics (HFA) facilities are in use as vaccination sites. Our Port Colborne, Niagara West and Niagara Centre YMCA HFA branches are designated vaccination sites in partnership with Niagara Region Public Health We believe this is an important way for us to advance community health and assist in with local vaccination. Questions related to these operations should be directed to Niagara Region Public Health. News sources: Niagara This Week St. Catharines Standard Niagara Falls Review Welland Tribune A Message from CEO Steven Chuang (click here) As you may be aware the province has announced that Ontario will move to Stage 3 of the reactivation framework effective Friday, July 16. Over the past several months our YMCA has been actively delivering in-person Infant, Preschool and Toddler Licensed Child Care, along with a range of virtual programs for infant, children, youth and families including EarlyON, Health and Fitness and Employment and Immigrant Services Programs, as well as, a variety of Community Outreach Programs. These were featured in our last edition of our Healthier Together Newsletter. We have also resumed in person programming this summer including: Summer Day Camp, Adventure Club, Outdoor Group Fitness Programs and Kid Fit. All of these activities are in full-swing and we are delighted to apply high standards in health and safety guidelines as we have started to bring people back to our YMCA in-person! Our Health and Fitness branches continue to proudly host vaccination clinics in Port Colborne, Welland and Grimsby. We remain in close contact with our partners at Niagara Region Public Health to monitor their ongoing needs for the use of our spaces. We are carefully reviewing the regulations and restrictions of the recent Stage Three of reactivation in Ontario announcement to determine what additional programs and services may be possible to expand later this month. We will continue to apply a staged approach to program reactivation this summer as we must ensure that our program reactivation is compatible with our vaccine clinics, summer day camp and outdoor fitness programming. We consistently apply the same three principles to each reactivation decision: the health and safety of all, community interest and demand for specific program options and responsible financial management to scale our program delivery to meet the needs of our members. Please stay tuned to our website and social media channels for more information about the site-specific programs we will offer as Stage Three unfolds. More information will follow. Membership Payments We will pause taking future payments from Health, Fitness and Aquatics members while we are closed and memberships will be placed on HOLD. Once we reopen, adjustment can be made to accounts. Child Care Thank you for your ongoing efforts to adhere to public health measures to ensure schools remain a safe place for students and Educators. Our school age before and after school programs plan to reopen on Tuesday, September 7 for the school year. There is no impact to our YMCA of Niagara infant/toddler/preschool child care programs.
