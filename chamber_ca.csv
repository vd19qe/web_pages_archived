Senior Director of International Trade, Mark Agnew, issued the following statement today on the United States’ re-imposition of tariffs on Canadian aluminum exports. “Canadian exports of aluminum pose absolutely no national security threat to the United States. Canadian aluminum forms a critical part of the U.S. defence industrial base and consequently plays a vital role in our shared defence and security objectives. Tariffs were the wrong instrument when they were first imposed in 2018, and they remain the wrong instrument now. At a time when our economies are struggling with the economic fallout of COVID-19, these tariffs will only exacerbate disruptions to North American supply chains. Instead of being caught in these distractions, our governments should be working collaboratively through the G7, G20, OECD and WTO to address the root issue of distortive industrial subsidies. As focus now shifts to Canada’s response, we call on the Deputy Prime Minister to urgently undertake consultations with the business community on the government’s retaliatory response to ensure adverse consequences for Canadian businesses are minimized in this fragile economic context.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country. We do this by influencing government policy, by providing essential business services and by connecting businesses to information they can use, to opportunities for growth and to a network of local chambers, businesses, decision-makers and peers from across the country, in every sector of the economy and at all levels of government, as well as internationally.

warns Canadian Chamber Harrison Ruess – 26/08/2020 – 0 OTTAWA – August 26, 2020 – More than 60 per cent of Canada’s restaurants risk having to close their doors permanently by November, according to government data. The Canadian Survey on Business Conditions (CSBC), produced by Statistics Canada with support from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, found that 29% of accommodation and food service businesses cannot operate at all with social distancing measures in effect. A further 31% will only able to remain operational for up to 90 days with distancing measures in effect. In other words, up to 60% of the industry could fail within three months. These figures are even more troubling when you consider the jobs already lost. When COVID hit, 83% of businesses in the accommodation and food services industries temporarily closed and two-thirds were forced to lay off some staff, including almost a quarter that were forced to lay off all their staff. According to Restaurants Canada, the food service industry lost 800,000 jobs. While the economy is now slowly beginning to recover, to date the federal government has not offered help tailored to the needs of the hardest hit industries like food services, which will take a long time to recover. That’s why the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and 15 food service businesses, representing more than 60 brands, is today launching the ‘Our Restaurants’ campaign. “We need to act now. Across Canada, our restaurants are where we meet for business or pleasure, where we got our first job and where our families spend a night out. Simply put, our restaurants are cornerstones in our communities,” said Hon. Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “The ‘Our Restaurants’ campaign underscores the urgent need for Canadians – both the public and our governments – to come together to support these businesses in their time of need.” The campaign puts a spotlight on the current situation faced by Canada’s restaurants amidst COVID-19: high costs, fewer customers, and government programs ill-equipped for the unique, long-term challenges faced by the industry. Our Restaurants is a campaign led by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and supported by: • Arterra Wines Canada • Benny & Co. • Boston Pizza • CWB Franchise Finance • Firkin Group of Pubs • Foodtastic • Gordon Food Service • Molson Coors Beverage Company • Northland Restaurant Group • Paramount Fine Foods • Pizza Pizza • Restaurants Canada • Service Inspired Restaurants (SIR Corp) • St. Louis Bar and Grill Restaurants • Sysco Canada Together these companies represent more than 60 of the best known restaurant brands across Canada and the whole of the food services industry. “We can all make a difference. Canadians need to observe safety measures while also starting to resume our normal lives, including being able to go out for a meal. Everyone also needs to remind their elected representatives of the importance of our restaurants in our lives,” concluded Beatty. The campaign is national, bilingual, includes paid advertising, and the launch of the website OurRestaurants.ca (NosRestaurants.ca in French). It is highlighted by this advertisement. Additional Quotes: “Through the ‘Our Restaurants’ campaign Boston Pizza stands with our fellow competitors big and small in highlighting the critical and urgent support needed to sustain the restaurant industry and the many Canadians it employs through the debilitating impacts of the pandemic.” - Jim Treliving Chairman and Founder Boston Pizza “The Firkin Group of Pubs stands in solidarity with restaurants across the country, in supporting the ‘Our Restaurants‘ campaign, in bringing awareness to the plight of our suffering industry, and the continued call for sustained government support, to ensure our survival, which is crucial to the overall Canadian economy.” - Larry Isaacs President The Firkin Group of Pubs “As co-chair of the Chamber's national committee on foodservice, we have come together to raise our voice concerning the looming threat of widespread restaurant closures. This would not only have disastrous impacts on employment, but on all sectors supporting restaurant operations, including food and beverage distributors and other businesses within the supply chain, right through to Canadian farmers. We welcome the additional voice of the Chamber to encourage Canadians to support their local restaurants so that foodservice businesses can continue contributing to Canada’s recovery.” - David Lefebvre Vice President, Federal and Quebec Restaurants Canada “We are proud to be a part of the ‘Our Restaurants’ campaign. We strive each and every day to provide the safest possible environment for our guests and our team members. Operating at 50% capacity in a business that has very low profit margins at the best of times is extremely difficult if not impossible. We need support from all levels of government to help us through these difficult times particularly in regards to occupancy costs. We ask for your support to lobby our government representatives to get immediate action. We want to be here in the future to serve you.” - Paul J. Bognar President and Chief Operating Officer Service Inspired Restaurants About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

While Deputy Prime Minister Freeland’s comments that this legislation is potentially coming next week are promising, businesses are growing more concerned with each passing day. Rent is due in nine days time, and businesses need certainty that funds will flow in time to make ends meet. The Canadian Chamber noted on October 9 that introducing legislation needs to be the top priority of government, and we are stressing this urgency once again today. Businesses – particularly those in the hardest hit sectors like food services, hospitality, tourism and travel – are desperately awaiting these programs. These sectors saw revenue declines of 70% or more during the first lockdown. Evidence points to similar declines during this second wave as temperatures chill and outdoor spaces such as patios are no longer realistic sources of revenue for restaurants. Timing is critical, and every day that passes without these funds flowing means more evictions, layoffs, and permanent closures. The October 9 announcement showed that government has been listening to businesses and are updating these programs to reflect the realities of a second wave. However, these programs are not perfect and conversations have been ongoing with government to ensure that further updates are made in time for legislation to be tabled as soon as possible. These updates must include: Updating the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy program so it can be fairly accessed by all struggling businesses. This means ensuring that businesses with one location and those with several locations are able to access equitable subsidy rates – similar to the structure of the CEWS program – with no restrictive caps. Franchisees and corporate entities should not be unfairly punished or have to lay off staff because of this program oversight. Ensuring CEWS supports provided to businesses during this second lockdown are consistent with those provided during the first (subsidy rate increased to 75% and the qualifying remuneration based on pre-crisis pay with no requirement to top-up). With significant parts of Quebec and Ontario in lockdown, and many businesses unable to operate due to restrictions, time is of the essence. We need to get these programs right, and we need to roll them out immediately. These programs are a lifeline for businesses, and they cannot survive further delay.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

The Act, which came into force on October 17, 2018, requires that the Minister of Health initiate a review of the Act three years following the legalization of recreational cannabis for adult use. The Working Group will begin its work immediately in order to provide comprehensive input into the federal government’s review of the Act, which must be launched no later than October 17, 2021. The industry’s review of the Act will be led by Eric Foster, Partner and Leader of the Dentons Canada cannabis practice.

Our economy did not contract as much as expected during the first wave but, with the second wave in full effect, our economic recovery will take much longer than initially anticipated, particularly for the hardest hit sectors. We have a long road ahead of us. Today’s Monetary Policy Report shows us that we will not return to the pre-pandemic size of the economy until 2022 and interest rates will remain low even longer. Another baseline for our economic health was released by Statistics Canada today showing Canada lost over 100,000 active businesses at the peak of the pandemic, primarily in food services, accommodation, arts and entertainment. We have been able to claw back some of these losses through reopening and the summer season, but the latest numbers still show that Canada has lost about 10% of its economic engine – its active businesses. We are now also at risk of increased business closures once again and, this time, more closures might be permanent. Achieving the economic trajectory outlined by the Bank of Canada will require recouping these business closures through both re-opening and new business creation. Any true recovery must, and inevitably will, be business-led. Just as every downturn is first felt on Main Street when the lights begin to go out, every recovery starts when the open signs begin reappearing. Over the past two days over 900 business leaders came together at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s AGM to determine what this economic recovery plan should look like. They focused on reinvigorating investment, building industrial capacity, health innovation and research, accelerating the rollout of national broadband, ensuring supply chain resiliency and getting Canadians back to work. In short, addressing the myriad ways in which the pandemic has affected our economy. Canada needs a growth-focused plan for businesses focused on these issues to fuel and, hopefully, accelerate this recovery.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

While Deputy Prime Minister Freeland’s comments that this legislation is potentially coming next week are promising, businesses are growing more concerned with each passing day. Rent is due in nine days time, and businesses need certainty that funds will flow in time to make ends meet. The Canadian Chamber noted on October 9 that introducing legislation needs to be the top priority of government, and we are stressing this urgency once again today. Businesses – particularly those in the hardest hit sectors like food services, hospitality, tourism and travel – are desperately awaiting these programs. These sectors saw revenue declines of 70% or more during the first lockdown. Evidence points to similar declines during this second wave as temperatures chill and outdoor spaces such as patios are no longer realistic sources of revenue for restaurants. Timing is critical, and every day that passes without these funds flowing means more evictions, layoffs, and permanent closures. The October 9 announcement showed that government has been listening to businesses and are updating these programs to reflect the realities of a second wave. However, these programs are not perfect and conversations have been ongoing with government to ensure that further updates are made in time for legislation to be tabled as soon as possible. These updates must include: Updating the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy program so it can be fairly accessed by all struggling businesses. This means ensuring that businesses with one location and those with several locations are able to access equitable subsidy rates – similar to the structure of the CEWS program – with no restrictive caps. Franchisees and corporate entities should not be unfairly punished or have to lay off staff because of this program oversight. Ensuring CEWS supports provided to businesses during this second lockdown are consistent with those provided during the first (subsidy rate increased to 75% and the qualifying remuneration based on pre-crisis pay with no requirement to top-up). With significant parts of Quebec and Ontario in lockdown, and many businesses unable to operate due to restrictions, time is of the essence. We need to get these programs right, and we need to roll them out immediately. These programs are a lifeline for businesses, and they cannot survive further delay.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

Recent legislation to support many of these businesses through rent and wage subsidies will be instrumental in recuperating some of the job losses in the hardest hit sectors. However, today’s numbers also demonstrate that there are more prolonged effects to our labour force as long-term unemployment – individuals unemployed for 27 weeks or longer – has seen the sharpest increase in recorded history. For all the uncertainty about what to do, we know one thing for sure: the true measure of every recovery is job growth, and everyone recovers when business recovers. Achieving this will require widespread business openings and re-openings as the latest data shows that we are still down 50,000 active businesses from pre-pandemic levels. It will also require governments to create significant reskilling and upskilling programs for those long-term unemployed Canadians who do not have jobs to go back to. To support career pivots, local and sector level labour market data will be important to determine new, high-demand and sustained employment and skills.

Worryingly, this places restaurants and hotels 15 points worse-off than any other industry. Looking forward, 22.5% of businesses in accommodation and food services also expect to decrease their staffing levels over the next three months, which is more than double the national average (10.4%). While these businesses reported they had applied for a number of government supports, less than a quarter (23%) were approved for CECRA, the previous commercial rent support program. This underscores that Canadian jobs and livelihoods depend on successful support programs being in place to keep businesses afloat. “This new data unfortunately paints a bleak and desperate picture for those food service and accommodation businesses that somehow made it through until now. Even for these survivors, it’s crunch time. The need for governments to switch from broad-based support programs to targeted supports is now clear,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “ The latest CSBC data was collected from Canadian businesses, supported by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, from mid-September through mid-October, which confirms the food service and accommodation industry is among the hardest hit. “It’s concerning to consider that this data, stark as it is, was collected at a time before much of the country was faced with the full force of a second wave of COVID-19. This data is also collected from businesses that, by definition, are the survivors from the first wave,” added Beatty. “Now that we are facing a second wave, winter coming, and depleted business reserves, it is crucial for the government to urgently provide targeted supports to businesses that depend on personal interactions to survive. This includes restaurants, hotels, travel, tourism, and hospitality businesses primarily. Canadian livelihoods depend on it.” For more data on how the food services industry has been impacted by COVID-19, click here.

The news is quite grim for 40% of Canada’s businesses looking forward, particularly for those businesses operating in sectors at the bottom of a K-shaped recovery. We now know that our economy will not recover until at least 2022, the most optimistic scenario assuming widespread vaccine deployment by then. The reality is we are in this for the long haul, and we need to start thinking long-term. With finite public resources available, we need to look carefully at the return on investment of government spending. Some programs are more beneficial than others. Some policies will contribute more to economic growth. Let’s make sure federal spending is focused on quality over quantity. Policy makers must be laser-focused on the nature of fiscal spending, and those programs must focus on addressing issues in specific sectors. The one-size-fits-all approach to support programs is not sustainable through 2022, and it may not be particularly useful at this stage of the pandemic. Consider the following data points: Close to three-fifths (57.0%) of businesses in the accommodation and food services sector reported that they were unable to take on more debt Approximately one-third of businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation (29.4%) and accommodation and food services (29.2%) sectors reported that they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than six months before considering further staffing actions, closure or bankruptcy Over half of the businesses in the accommodation and food services (55.6%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (54.9%) sectors did not expect their revenues to be higher over the next three months than over the previous three months Over one-quarter of businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector (28.9%) and almost one-quarter of businesses in the accommodation and food services sector (22.5%) expected to reduce their number of employees over the next three months, the highest proportions among all sectors With the second wave of the virus now in full force, keeping our fiscal powder dry for the longer run and tailoring supports for the most severely affected individuals and businesses should characterize the second wave of support programs.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

The UK is Canada’s third-largest export market and second-largest destination for investment abroad, in addition to accounting for nearly 40 percent of our exports to the European Union. In simple terms, if our trade agreement with the EU matters, then so does securing continuity in our trade with the UK. Today’s announcement also provides a solid foundation for us to expand trade and investment opportunities in discussions on an enhanced bilateral agreement. As Canadian businesses continue to deal with the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, the certainty provided by the Canadian and British governments in agreeing to a bilateral trade deal is critical. This agreement provides a critical step to help ensure companies will not see tariffs re-imposed on January 1, 2021 and that important discussions will be able to progress on regulatory barriers affecting Canadian exporters. We call on the Canadian and British government to publish details of the agreement so that businesses can understand all the practical details. We also call on the government and parliamentarians to work together in ensuring a prompt passage of the necessary implementing legislation to provide certainty for Canadian businesses at the earliest possible opportunity.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

Worryingly, this places restaurants and hotels 15 points worse-off than any other industry. Looking forward, 22.5% of businesses in accommodation and food services also expect to decrease their staffing levels over the next three months, which is more than double the national average (10.4%). While these businesses reported they had applied for a number of government supports, less than a quarter (23%) were approved for CECRA, the previous commercial rent support program. This underscores that Canadian jobs and livelihoods depend on successful support programs being in place to keep businesses afloat. “This new data unfortunately paints a bleak and desperate picture for those food service and accommodation businesses that somehow made it through until now. Even for these survivors, it’s crunch time. The need for governments to switch from broad-based support programs to targeted supports is now clear,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “ The latest CSBC data was collected from Canadian businesses, supported by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, from mid-September through mid-October, which confirms the food service and accommodation industry is among the hardest hit. “It’s concerning to consider that this data, stark as it is, was collected at a time before much of the country was faced with the full force of a second wave of COVID-19. This data is also collected from businesses that, by definition, are the survivors from the first wave,” added Beatty. “Now that we are facing a second wave, winter coming, and depleted business reserves, it is crucial for the government to urgently provide targeted supports to businesses that depend on personal interactions to survive. This includes restaurants, hotels, travel, tourism, and hospitality businesses primarily. Canadian livelihoods depend on it.” For more data on how the food services industry has been impacted by COVID-19, click here.

The statement provided needed supports for businesses and Canadians to build a foundation for growth, though many questions remain about the government’s economic recovery plan. For example, the economic statement presents a plan to create a plan for childcare and longer-term recovery. The economic statement outlined continued and new spending to help Canadians and businesses weather the economic impacts of the pandemic. Businesses pressed for a targeted approach to support programs, focusing resources on sectors most at risk of permanent closures during a second wave. While further measures will be required to assist the travel, tourism, food services, hotel, cultural, and energy sectors, today’s focused support for the hardest hit industries will help many of businesses survive the second wave and be there to propel our economic recovery. The rate at which women are being forced to leave the workforce because of childcare gaps continues to undermine Canada’s economic recovery and requires emergency funding. While today’s announcement is a first step towards addressing the broader issue of childcare, the Canadian Chamber has pressed for immediate assistance to flow directly to parents and childcare providers. The wage subsidy program or tax policies are two levers the government already has at its disposal to provide immediate relief. While the emergency supports announced today will help many Canadians and businesses through a challenging winter, the government’s plans to manage the pandemic and restore economic growth remain unclear. We hope to see these detailed plans in a budget early next year. To carry us from now until a significant majority of Canadians have been immunized, we need to move to actively managing the disease instead of just responding to it. Unfortunately, Canadians are still waiting for a plan that clearly sets out how we can curb the spread of the disease, protect the most vulnerable and speed up Canadians’ ability to return to more normal lives. Similarly, we also require an economic strategy with a clear fiscal anchor to help us move from subsidies to a private sector-led recovery where both individuals and businesses can be self-sufficient again. All Canadians understand the need for one-time, emergency spending to support people and businesses through the crisis, but now is not the time to add permanent new spending programs that will mortgage our children’s future. With the right policies today, we can hasten the day when Canadians will be able to reclaim their normal lives and enjoy an economy that is growing once again.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

Today it revealed the early results. “Reforming Canada’s tax system can help the economy recover, and our tax panel experts have provided some initial steps that can be taken right now. Canadians and the businesses employing them need our government to build a competitive and growth-focused tax system, because any true recovery must, and inevitably will, be led by business,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO, Canadian Chamber of Commerce. After consultations with a broad mix of Canadians, businesses and tax practitioners on how to harness Canada’s tax system to foster job retention and growth, the Canadian Chamber is sharing what its panel heard is needed now. While a more comprehensive report to be published early next year will set out ideas for long-term structural reform, the Canadian Chamber is releasing 30 specific recommendations for the government to enact now to help Canada recover from the pandemic’s impact. “There are many small, simple actions the federal government can take right now that together will go a long way to helping Canadians and businesses cope with the pandemic’s economic fallout,” said Patrick Gill, Senior Director of Tax and Financial Policy for the Canadian Chamber. “There’s no reason the government can’t use tax policy as a lever to create better business conditions today to spur a faster recovery tomorrow. While it may be still too early to move forward with more far-reaching structural tax reform, Canada can’t afford to let its tax system keep falling behind its G7 competitors.” The Chamber’s simple tax reform suggestions to help Canadians and businesses include: Support Canadians by: Automating filing for simple returns Enhancing the deduction for childcare Simplifying the work-space-in-the-home deduction Improving the use of electronic communications, includingthe broader use of email and permitting documents to be electronically attached to filings. Support small employers by: Introducing a temporary GST/HST holiday to spur local purchases Demonstrating continued leniency with small business audits during the pandemic Simplifying rules around income-splitting with children Removing tax disincentives that arise on the sale of a small business to family members. Support large employers by: Processing work-space-in-the-home deductions without a T2200 form Deferring the CRA’s right to collect disputed tax amounts Increasing deductibility on capital expenditures in the year incurred Accelerating the ability to turn tax losses into cash. “As political leaders consider their next steps to foster recovery and prosperity post COVID-19, they would be well advised to consider the aggregate voices of everyday Canadians, tax experts and business leaders captured in the Canadian Chamber’s independent review,” said Dr. Trevin Stratton, Chief Economist and VP of Policy for the Canadian Chamber. To review all 30 recommendations, click here. The roundtables were conducted between August and November 2020, with over 450 participants. A panel of leading tax and business experts helped inform The Canadian Chamber’s tax review process.

With COVID-19 cases increasing at an alarming rate, our leaders face a difficult balancing act. The challenge for us all is to chart a path forward that protects Canadians’ health – on COVID, mental health and other aspects – as well as their economic well-being. However, it is neither socially nor economically sustainable to rely heavily on rotating lockdowns while we wait for an effective vaccine to be widely administered next year. Between now and the time when the pandemic is brought fully under control it will be important for Canada to manage the disease by controlling its spread and severity, while allowing Canadians to regain more of their ordinary lives. Public health must be the highest priority, and a well-designed strategy to manage COVID-19 will save lives and reduce the pandemic’s social and economic damage. However, to achieve these results, we must move from simply reacting to the disease to actively controlling it. A coherent national strategy must include all three levels of government working together as partners, collaboratively addressing these six key components: data-driven, science-based policies to limit the spread of the virus significant, widespread rapid testing and contact tracing open, transparent communications and consistent messaging tailored support for the hardest hit economically a well-designed, well-organised and well-communicated plan for vaccine administration a holistic approach to evaluating the costs and benefits of actions to control the disease Today, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and Retail Council of Canada, are together launching the Pan-Canadian Strategy to Manage COVID-19. This document provides the framework for our governments to finally begin to get ahead of the pandemic. The strategy has been sent directly to the Prime Minister, Canada’s 13 Premiers, and Canada’s Mayors (via the Federation of Canadian Municipalities). It is our hope that they will quickly move to incorporate the strategy’s principles into their daily activities. Additionally, the four groups are asking all Canadians to show their support for this effort by signing a petition, which calls on our governments to implement the Pan-Canadian Strategy to Manage COVID-19. The full strategic plan framework and petition for Canadians can be found at NationalStrategy.ca. Additional quotes “While there is optimism that a vaccine may be widely administered across Canada sometime by middle or late 2021, we cannot lose sight of the real harm that is taking place each day now. Equally, we cannot afford to continue with the daily, reactionary status quo and rotating lockdowns until vaccine administration is widespread. The business community stands ready to provide leadership and assist our governments as they urgently undertake the critical work to implement a strategy to begin to manage this ongoing crisis.” – Hon. Perrin Beatty President and CEO Canadian Chamber of Commerce “Making the shift to evidence-based policymaking is essential. Policy decisions, particularly at a provincial and municipal level, are often being issued without supporting data or a coherent rationale, the worst being the disparate “shot in the dark” approaches to lockdowns. Retailers will support measures that properly target the spread of infection and strive to contain economic damage to the extent possible. We cannot support policy experiments with tenuous connection to better health outcomes and devastating economic side-effects.” – Diane J. Brisebois President and CEO Retail Council of Canada “Indigenous businesses continue to face significant historical and institutional barriers to business development, growth, and expansion and the pandemic has only served to exacerbate those inequalities. The second wave of the pandemic is having devastating effects on Indigenous communities. Now is the time to come together with a strategy to ensure an equitable recovery from this difficult period.” – Tabatha Bull President and CEO Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business “Not only have blanket lockdowns been devastating for small businesses, but the patchwork quilt of approaches by various government can harm public and business confidence in the measures we are being asked to adopt. As well, far too many businesses have slipped through the cracks of both federal and provincial support programs. Nine months into the pandemic, we should be in a much better position to respond to both the health and economic challenges COVID-19 has created.” – Dan Kelly President and CEO Canadian Federation of Independent Business About our organizations The Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

Buy American restrictions remain a perennial problem for Canadian businesses seeking to access government contracts with our largest trading partner. The rules have progressively tightened over the years, and today’s announcement represents another unhelpful step to make it more difficult for Canadian businesses to secure contracts in the U.S. In this deeply uncertain period, Canada and the U.S. should find ways to deepen opportunities for businesses to strengthen their cross border supply chains. Canadian components play a critical role in the economic and national security of the U.S. Although the full impact of today’s announcement will take time to cascade to different parts of the U.S. government, its chilling effect on business will be acutely felt north of the border. Additionally, we are concerned by the suggestion that trade rule modernization could become an exercise to loosen obligations and encourage further buy local policies. We call on the Canadian government to ensure market access commitments made by our trading partners are not rolled back.

Despite the temptation to keep vaccines within a country’s borders, the world economy will only emerge from this pandemic once there is widespread distribution of the vaccine across all continents. “We are deeply concerned with the Commission’s decision to introduce a vaccine authorization scheme for export of COVID-19 vaccines and its inputs. Given the concentrated nature of vaccine production, this regime creates significant uncertainty for vaccine manufacturers, logistic companies, citizens, and businesses globally. “Although we welcome the assurances provided to the Government of Canada, Canadians remain exposed to potential delays and cutbacks, given the Commission’s intention to assess export authorizations on the basis of impacts on the EU’s advance purchase agreements. The authorization scheme also contradicts the spirit of the Ottawa Group Trade and Health Initiative and the Commission’s longstanding policies opposing measures that impede global supply chains, as well as risking encouraging other countries to implement similar actions that disrupt the manufacturing and flow of vaccines. “We call upon the Commission at a minimum to commit to granting export authorizations for all applications.

Canadian Chamber of Commerce By Dr. Aaron Henry, Senior Director of Natural Resources and Sustainable Growth, Canadian Chamber of Commerce One of the most compelling and least reported elements of the federal government’s recently announced plan to meet its ambitious 2030 climate targets is the commitment to pursue greater collaboration with Canada’s trading partners and allies on climate policy. In its Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy plan, the government signalled it will seek partners “to drive common objectives including green recovery, net-zero goals, carbon market alignment, and harmonization of regulatory frameworks for climate action.” This could be the start of significant reshaping of global trade relations. Commentators have consistently remarked that COVID-19 is transformative in part because of its role as an accelerator of dynamics that were already in play. The taken-for-granted nature of globalization, for example, has become increasingly fragile in recent years, especially in the wake of the Trump administration and Brexit. There is a plausible and highly possible scenario where COVID accelerates a move away from global trade structures like the European Union (EU) common market, the World Trade Organization and North American free trade. The new reality may be a form of bilateralism or smaller regional markets in which Canada will be expected to compete, particularly when it comes to climate policy. It is unlikely that America-first policies will disappear after Donald Trump’s time in the White House. The politics of personal protective equipment (PPE), vaccine availability and fragile supply chains could be harbingers of an aggressive return to domestic production and manufacturing. Canada might find itself seeking collaboration on its climate policy ambitions in the midst of a world that is transitioning away from western-led globalization toward a precarious and fragmented international environment. It is possible that in this environment, international climate policy will not be brokered through international institutions and global trade agreements, which together shaped the global order from Bretton Woods to post-Washington consensus following the global recession of 2008, but in far more localized “climate trade regimes.” New terms like this should always be subject to suspicion, so I will try to provide a definition. A climate trade regime would look like a system of trade among two or more nations where a group of policies such as shared carbon pricing systems, harmonization of emission standards and shared carbon border adjustment regimes (CBAs) shapes trade relations. CBA is a relatively new concept that is picking up traction in the European Union and the United States. Put simply, CBA is a tariff system where exporters of carbon-intensive products like fossil fuels from jurisdictions without carbon pricing are charged by the importing nation. CBA is designed to level the economic playing field to ensure that countries like Canada that have stronger environmental regulations and carbon pricing regimes are not undersold by nations without these provisions. These carbon pricing regimes would also see commodities from some nations flow more easily than others. Ultimately what a nation imports would become aligned with the management of its national carbon budget; in other words, the amount of carbon emissions the nation allows itself. By offering climate-forward countries an opportunity to remain competitive, the momentum for these regimes is growing. CBAs will also bring into focus how the imports from other nations feed into a country’s emissions, an angle that has not really been a matter of direct policy. This means that to successfully implement CBAs, they will likely need to be supported by and connected to the robust digital accounting systems that are being proposed as a means to create common links to each nation’s climate targets. Nations will not only be sure to slap higher fees on carbon-intensive goods, but it is also possible they will seek opportunities to pick less carbon-intensive products of the same type of commodity. There is, after all, a significant difference between steel produced on a power-grid run by coal than steel produced on power grids like Canada’s, where renewable power is predominant. As copper, steel, lithium and other rare and critical minerals play a key role in the carbon intensity of products like electric vehicles, we might not just see nations charge higher fees on carbon-intensive commodities. Imports might eventually be managed for the purposes of balancing national carbon budgets. While resource products such as fossil fuels are obvious examples, the next frontier might be data, especially if nations move to digital currencies (think Bitcoin) relying on blockchain technology, which can be energy-intensive. All this could lead to highly specialized and very sticky trade relations. If the imports of primary commodities, especially energy, slowly become considerations of how nations manage their national emission inventories, it is possible that import strategies will start to favour products based on the regulatory environments that shape how primary commodities are extracted. The free flow of goods may become narrow and sensitive to considerations such as the equivalency of carbon pricing regimes between trading nations, emission controls and other related climate standards. Given that climate policy regimes are highly contextual and complex, and that globalization may continue to recede, it is plausible that climate trade regimes will not become global in structure. Instead, arrangements might be highly regionalized or even configured solely in bilateral trade relationships. In this world, resource-producing countries like Canada that export minerals, metals, oil, gas, forestry and agricultural products will need to set these commodities apart from those from other jurisdictions. The need to do so will intensify as CBAs and carbon pricing regimes include cost of production and carbon intensity in their price. Climate policy could fast become climate trade, as trade deals will be made not based on if they create reciprocal or fair balance of payments, but instead on whether they help keep a nation’s carbon emissions low. What do we need to know? Trade between nations could become longstanding but rigid. This will benefit nations that secure these arrangements but could leave many nations without access to foreign markets for their products. This could create significant economic pressures for nations that produce more primary resources than they consume but find themselves crowded out of climate trade regimes where carbon intensity and life-cycle emissions of imports are carefully scrutinized. Furthermore, if we are headed for a protectionist world where countries aggressively shield their domestic industries, CBAs and national carbon accounting could be at the epicentre of this shift. Global climate policy remains a double-edged sword for resource nations like Canada. On the one hand, if we do see global climate policy mature into climate trade regimes, Canada has an opportunity to benefit from the policies it has put in place to regulate, effectively cost, and reduce its emissions. It is possible that our early move on climate policy, which has created significant pressures for the resource sector, will secure long-term trade relations and keep Canadian products flowing through the CBA regimes of other nations. This will depend on the extent to which we can differentiate our products based on these environmental standards and practices. While environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards for socially conscious investors are an early phase of this differentiation, specific and highly detailed environmental data on products will be key to a 21st-century custom duty stamp. On the other hand, this is contingent on other nations and importers recognizing the differentiation of Canadian products compared to others. To date, there is mixed success on this front. The EU, for instance, is willing to import fossil fuels from Russia and Nigeria while actively divesting from Canada’s oil and gas sector, despite the fact that Canada’s climate policy regime is far more stringent than both nations. It is highly possible that without appropriate steps, Canadian resource companies could differentiate their products but still find they lose market share to other products for reasons unrelated to environmental metrics. Much will depend on how climate policy unfolds in other jurisdictions and the extent to which politics, not climate concerns, shapes the DNA of CBA methodology and how it measures and quantifies emissions. Canada, in its current economic structure, cannot succeed without either an incredible domestic market of offsets, or access to robust international offset markets. If climate policy becomes climate trade, Canada will have to change its current economic structure. Even as Canadian producers across the resource sector continue to reduce the emission intensity of their products, the baseline of our climate target is 30 per cent below 2005 emission levels and then net-zero by 2050. If the objective is to produce highly differentiated products that gain market share based on their reduced emission intensity, Canada’s commitment to reducing emissions below 2005 levels means there is only so much global market share Canada can displace before its absolute emissions surpass its Paris target. The extent to which exports of carbon-intensive resource products can grow beyond 2005 levels will depend on how effectively Canada achieves the “net” of net-zero. Arguably, the Paris Agreement’s stipulation of voluntary international co-operation to help governments achieve climate targets belongs to a liberal international order, and not a protectionist global order. An exchange of offsets amongst national governments looks unlikely, even with the heft of U.S. leadership back at the negotiating table. Instead, a robust voluntary private offset market accessible to private companies will probably emerge long before a protocol to exchange offsets amongst nations is inked and may well be achievable at the next United Nations climate change conference (UNFCCC COP 26) later in 2021. The price of these offsets relative to the price of Canadian resource commodities may become ever more important if other nations start to select import strategies tied to national carbon budgets. Though largely unanswered in the federal government’s climate plan, if climate policy becomes climate trade, Canada’s economic footing will depend on how the offset question is settled.

Today’s data speaks to the stark year-over-year comparisons for the sector, revealing a precipitous drop in sales between December 2019 and December 2020: Total food service sales are down over 35% ($6.5b vs $4.2b) Full service restaurant sales are down over 50% ($2.9b vs $1.4b) Drinking place sales are down over 64% ($221m vs $78m) “Restaurants were some of the very first businesses to be hit by the pandemic and broad-based business restrictions last March. As this new data shows, the food services sector continues to be severely weakened,” commented Alla Drigola, Director of Parliamentary Affairs and SME Policy. “Canada’s restaurants are predominantly small businesses that have limited cash reserves and are at their debt limits. The need for targeted supports to help them weather the storm is urgent.” An example of a targeted support includes providing a temporary and targeted consumption tax holiday to boost consumer spending for this and other hard hit sectors. Patrick Gill, Senior Director of Tax and Financial Policy, adds: “At the very minimum, government policies right now must do no further harm to this sector. Ottawa’s looming alcohol excise tax increase, currently scheduled for April 1, would only exacerbate the challenges these businesses are facing.

The Roadmap announced today by Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden is a welcome reprieve from the past four years, and the business community is eager to usher in the next phase of the relationship between the two countries. The intent of the plan announced today signals a positive outlook for workers and businesses on both sides of the border, but its success hinges on the ability of both countries to deliver on the details. As Canada looks to return to more normalized relations with the US, there are opportunities for both countries to help each other build a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery. Since we know that every recovery is a business-led recovery, Canadian businesses need certainty on three critical trade-related issues: Given how integrated and interdependent our supply chains are, there should be a carve out for Canadian companies on Buy American rules. Both countries should coordinate approaches to carbon border adjustments to reduce unnecessary costs associated with regulatory overlap for businesses on both sides of the border. The approach should recognize the realities of our integrated supply chains and existing price on carbon. Business also needs a forward-looking plan that provides predictability for the eventual unwinding of border restrictions, which includes clear milestones and consultations with industry on the new normal. It will be critical to ensure these issues are addressed in the Roadmap’s delivery given their broad impacts on both Canadian and US businesses.

We have been urging the government to publish the details on what support rates will look like past March 13, and today’s announcement from the Prime Minister answered those calls. Businesses can now plan with certainty this spring, knowing what level of support they will receive from these critical support programs through June of this year. The Canadian Chamber has also been advocating for these programs to keep 2019 as the reference period from which businesses can determine the level of decline in their revenue, rather than the year-over-year calculations currently used. This change is critical to ensure businesses and employees continue to receive the support they need by measuring revenue declines against the pre-pandemic period. We are very pleased to see this direct recommendation implemented to provide certainty and support for businesses. We must avoid phasing out these programs too quickly for businesses in the sectors that have been hardest hit and will take longer to recover. These sectors include tourism, travel, food services, accommodations, and the events sector, among others. This means extending CEWS and CERS past June, and until such a time that these businesses are able to recover.

While Canada’s 5.4% contraction is the steepest annual decline on record, today’s numbers also tell a tale of a diverging, two-track economy. Today’s number are promising on the whole, but show a challenging situation for those businesses stuck on the southbound track. While goods-producing industries saw growth at the end of last year, the services-producing industry edged down once again in December. Many businesses in the hardest hit sectors, such as accommodation, food services, retail, travel and tourism, are still struggling as they rely on physical presence. The uneven economic impact on these businesses has been more pronounced in Canada due to the trade-off between restrictions and economic activity for these sectors. There are likely brighter days ahead as pent-up demand, household savings, and consumption are released and our economy reopens as Canada achieves widespread vaccination this year. This pent-up demand will hopefully benefit the hardest hit sectors the most as they have experienced the steepest decline in demand. In the medium term, however, the hardest hit businesses will enter the recovery period suffering under a debt load that is fast becoming unsustainable and will have to be repaid if there is no further debt relief. Due to their debt loads, these small businesses will also be the most vulnerable to any increases in interest rates as our economy recovers. Targeted support for these companies should be an integral piece of any economic recovery plan. While the public sector continues to grow, housing investment continues to rise and consumption is expected to rebound, business investment slackened and is not projected to fully recover until the end of next year according to the Bank of Canada. Many businesses on the northbound track will be looking to invest and governments should be exploring unlocking this private capital to manage historically high debt and deficits and mitigate upside risks. Canada’s investment environment was falling behind our competitors well before the pandemic and, if we want to attract and retain capital in Canada, the business community will need policy measures that encourage investment, job creation and productivity growth in the federal budget. As the business community looks forward, it is crystal clear Canada’s economic recovery will be business-led. The quickest and most cost-effective path to economic recovery is through the job creation and investments from businesses on Main Streets across the country.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

With a whopping 51 per cent reporting they did not know how long they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures before considering closure or bankruptcy, the coping ability of businesses to weather the pandemic is quickly dwindling. Forty per cent stated they cannot take on more debt, with the burden even higher for small businesses. Only 38.4% of businesses expect they’ll be able to operate for 12 months or longer at current revenue levels. 51.3% of all business do not know how long they’ll be able to continue to operate at current revenue levels, with smaller businesses facing higher unknowns (52.2% for 1-4 employees; 50.9% for 5-19 employees; 49.3% for 20-99 employees; 44.2% for 100 or more employees). Nearly half (46.4%) of businesses did not know how long they could continue to operate at current levels before considering laying off staff. Close to one-third (29.6%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expect a reduction in their number of employees over the next three months. More small businesses are at their debt limit: 41.8% of businesses with 1-4 and 5-19 employees are unable to take on more debt; 29.0% for 20-99 employees; 17.1% for 100 or more employees. Following 2020’s GDP numbers released earlier this week, today’s CSBC data offers the first glimpse of what Canada’s businesses and our economy is facing in the first quarter of 2021. These numbers point to a compounding effect of previous lockdowns. With each new wave businesses are stretched thinner, and a third round of lockdowns could be the breaking point for many. Looking forward, Canada must find new answers to manage the pandemic until vaccination rates increase. We simply cannot afford to take the same approach we’ve seen used over the past year. We need a viable reopening plan that takes a holistic approach with a focus on tools like rapid-testing and robust contact tracing. The survival of our businesses depends on it.

Abacus Data completed the polling for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce by Abacus Data. Today, slightly more than 1 in 2 Canadians (51 per cent) are still going into the workplace most of the time, with another 12 per cent splitting their time between the workplace and working from home. Only 36 per cent are working from home full time. Asked when they thought their workplace would return to normal, nearly half of Canadians (45 per cent) did not believe that would occur until 2022. “It’s clear that Canadians and their employers have been adapting to work and life during the COVID-19 pandemic, doing their part to keep us safe and carrying the Canadian economy on their shoulders. Their pessimism about the return to normal may speak to broader concerns about our country’s slow pace at vaccinating and the need for a concrete plan for what comes next. While they see what good planning looks like in workplaces, they also hope to see our political leaders set a clear pathway out of this pandemic,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Canada’s largest business association. The poll also showed half of Canadians had never worked from home before the pandemic. The pandemic’s shift to remote work may not be as extensive as originally thought, with the data showing a rise from 23% to 36% for those Canadians working mostly from home. While 27% of Canadians said they were working from home some of the time before the pandemic, now only 12% say they are splitting their time between the workplace and home. For those Canadians going into the workplace, 4 out of 5 feel safe doing so. Conversely, only 1 in 2 of those working from home most or part of the time feel safe about the prospect of returning to their workplaces. The data suggests the majority of Canadians already going into the workplace most of the time are seeing the right safety precautions to keep them feeling safe. Regardless of where they worked, the key concerns for returning to a workplace full-time were exposure to customers coming into the office and using public transit for the work commute. Not surprisingly, the data shows these concerns are most apparent for those working in small retail/food service businesses dependent on a physical presence. The Canadian Chamber and our members are working hard to support vaccination, rapid screening, and PPE programs across the country to lower the risk of infection from in-person interactions. Today’s data also helps narrow down where smaller businesses should invest in PPE and new processes to help protect their employees and make them more comfortable. “As vaccines begin to roll out, more and more Canadians are asking what is the bridge between now and completion of mass vaccination? Part of that question is what a return to the physical workplace looks like. Helping employers address their concerns and plan more carefully will help make the transition, whenever it comes, smoother for everyone. The sooner our governments can provide a roadmap, the better,” said Trevin Stratton, Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, Policy. The Canadian Chamber and Abacus will next examine what makes Canadians feel safe or unsafe about their current workplace or their return to a physical workplace.

Methodology The survey was conducted with 2,000 Canadian adults of which 1,056 were currently employed either full-time or part-time from March 25 to 30, 2021. A random sample of panelists were invited to complete the survey from a set of partner panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. These partners are typically double opt-in survey panels, blended to manage out potential skews in the data from a single source. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 2,000 Canadians is +/- 2.19%, 19 times out of 20. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 1,056 employed Canadians is +/- 3.1%, 19 times out of 20. The base sample were weighted according to census data to ensure that the sample matched Canada’s population according to age, gender, educational attainment, and region. Totals may not add up to 100 due to rounding.

Media Releases Apr 09, 2021 Carbon tax ruling provides policy certainty, but concerns remain about the competitiveness of Canadian businesses – Canadian Chamber of Commerce However, the issue is divisive for many Canadians. Understanding that the federal carbon tax and its incremental increases on the price on carbon over the following decades are here to stay is one thing. Ensuring businesses are able to successfully navigate a carbon price with confidence is quite another. To succeed, businesses will need sustainable finance and public policy supports. Canadian businesses have already taken impressive steps to bring all of us closer to Canada’s ambitious net-zero target, but further progress will require close collaboration between government and industry.

As employers and providers of goods and services to the general public, businesses have a critical role to play in getting Canadians vaccinated, which will ultimately create the conditions for the relaxation of public health restrictions currently in place. Given the overwhelming volume of information available on vaccines, this resource hub provides companies of all sizes with a single focal point for the information they need to know as employers and the resources they can use to reassure and encourage their employees to get vaccinated. Vaccine 101 Vaccine Distribution Business Tips Talking to Your Employees Knowing the facts about vaccines is critical, which is not always easy given the breadth of resources out there. Vaccines have been robustly tested in clinical trials around the world to confirm their safety and efficacy. There are a number of resources that can provide businesses the facts on vaccines, which will ultimately equip owners and operators to engage their employees. COVID-19 vaccines authorized in Canada is the Government of Canada’s primary resource page for up-to-date information about the vaccines authorized in Canada. Vaccine development and approval in Canada is a resource that explains the rigorous scientific process involved in developing a new vaccine and conducting clinical trials as well as the process Health Canada follows to review and approve vaccines. There is also a video available on vaccine development and approval. Below are Health Canada’s resources for each authorized vaccine, including how the vaccine works, how it is administered, possible side effects and vaccine safety after authorization: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine Some provincial jurisdictions are supporting the ability of companies to act as vaccine distribution hubs for the general public and their employees. Other jurisdictions are providing multiple avenues for the general population, particularly those in essential sectors — such as food processing and distribution or construction — to receive a vaccination before the general public. Vaccines and treatments for COVID-19: Vaccine rollout describes the vaccine deliveries to provinces and where vaccines have been distributed to date. Each province or territory has a detailed vaccine rollout plan and booking system: Alberta British Columbia (find your local BC public health unit) Manitoba New Brunswick Newfoundland and Labrador Northwest Territories Nova Scotia Nunavut Ontario (find your local Ontario public health unit) For Businesses: the Ontario Chamber of Commerce’s Vaccination Support Council is a resource for companies to assist in vaccine distribution through supporting public health units or offering a workplace as a site for vaccination Prince Edward Island (PEI vaccine rollout updates can be found here) Quebec For Businesses: Quebec’s Vaccination Enterprise site is available for companies to participate in setting up a vaccination site for their employees or by meeting human and material resource needs Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan’s vaccine plan updates can be found here) Yukon Vaccines are very safe, but as with all medicines, there is the potential for side effects after administration. Possible side effects for COVID-19 vaccines are very minor and may include redness, soreness or swelling on the arm that received the shot, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and mild fever. Read more about vaccine safety and possible side effects. There are active ways employers can help their workforce get vaccinated since it is ultimately the collection of individual and company-level decisions that make a difference. Depending on your company’s financial capacity, there are several practical things your company can do to help your employees get vaccinated: Offer paid time off to any employee to get vaccinated. Potentially as much as four to six hours depending where vaccine clinics are located. Provide a transportation voucher (i.e. Uber/Lyft gift card, bus pass) to help cover your employees’ transportation costs to and from a vaccine site. Reimburse the employees’ childcare expenses during their vaccine appointments up to a certain amount. Offer internet access or language support services to help employees schedule their appointment when it becomes available. Provide information to your employees on the local public health or provincial vaccine timelines via email or printouts on a staff board in a common area. Offer paid leave of one to two days if needed after vaccination. Companies should also start thinking about how to appropriately collect vaccine KPIs amongst their workforce while respecting the privacy of their employees. One option could be undertaking voluntary surveys to understand whether their workforce has received one or two doses of the vaccine, if they intend to receive the vaccine or if they prefer to not disclose. It is also critical to manage expectations for those who get vaccinated with their first or second dose. You should ensure your employees can expect public health guidance to continue to focus on handwashing, masks and physical distancing. This will help manage expectations and reduce any issues with workplace tension between those who are vaccinated and those who are not. Whether by staff meetings, emails or casual 1:1 conversations, employers have countless touchpoints every day to speak with their employees about vaccines. The choice to get vaccinated is ultimately with the individual, but the conversations you have will affect not only your employees but also the information they share with their friends and family about vaccines. These are the top tips for talking to your employees, which have been adapted from the Health Action Alliance: Listening Is Key: You need to have a conversation with your staff rather than a debate. Their decision to get vaccinated is theirs to make, which should always be acknowledged. Focus on being inviting and respectful and encourage them to look at information from respected sources. Lead with Empathy: It is important to acknowledge people’s concerns given it has been a difficult time for Canadians during the pandemic. It is okay for people — even you — to have questions about vaccines given the rate at which news changes and the wide number of voices in media and social media. Do not be condescending. Instead, support your staff taking time off for their vaccination or helping their family members. Facts about Safety Matter: Speak in plain language with people. Provide facts from reputable sources but don’t make up what you don’t know or use information from unreputable sources, particularly on social media. You also cannot provide medical advice to people’s unique health circumstances. Be Authentic: Share why you have decided to get vaccinated and why it is important for you and your family.

National Reopening Government Regulation Tracker In order to operate, businesses must abide by all national, provincial/territorial and local codes issued by our governments. This includes when and which businesses are allowed to open, an array of health and safety measures, social distancing standards, occupancy limits and more. The new rules will inform how your operations and health and safety standards must be adapted to the current situation. Due to ongoing changes in the regulatory landscape, please find current information on this dedicated regulation tracking page. Personal Protective Equipment Workplace Layout and Operations Workplace Screening and Rapid Testing Communications amidst Reopening Financial, HR, and Pay Considerations Childcare and Social Services Legal and Liability Additional Resources and Guides Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Reopening the economy — and keeping it open — hinges on our collective ability to maintain the health and safety for our staff and customers. If we are unable to succeed in this objective, governments will continue to be in the cycle of ordering business closures. Measures surrounding the use of PPE — including what types are required, when it is needed, how to use it — should be included in your health and safety plan. Business operators should build a culture of safety, and that begins with ensuring all leaders and employees are using the proper PPE for your setting. The types of PPE your business requires will depend on a variety of situations (e.g., office, storefront, manufacturing, indoor vs. outdoor conditions). Information on PPE is available from the federal government (general information | authorized PPE products). Workplace Layout and Operations Introducing a new workplace layout is one of the most important considerations a business must make before reopening. It is important to keep track of any changing requirements between different phases or zones of lockdowns. When arranging your new layout, there are several things to consider. Space out workers: Ensure there is at least six feet between workstations or stagger desks where possible. Consider adding screens or cubicle walls between desks to help prevent the spread of the virus. If your business is responsible for washroom areas, consider closing every other stall and taping off every other sink to maintain distancing. Physical barriers: If distancing is not physically possible, ensure you have stringent screening measures in place, increased handwashing procedures and signage and additional PPE where possible. Room capacities: Each room should have a capacity limit sign on the door that states the maximum capacity, limited to the number of people who can be in the room seated two metres apart. Distancing markers: Ensure there are stand markers at least six feet apart indicating where customers can stand or where employees must wait. This is important for high-traffic areas such as entrances, lobbies, check-out areas, delivery zones, office common areas (kitchen, boardroom, washroom), etc. Consider adding additional space for seating areas, particularly if customers or workers will be eating in this space with their masks off. Operating Tactics: Eating at Work Lunchrooms: Any time you are with other people in close proximity without wearing a mask is considered high risk. Space out tables two feet from each other. Have everyone face in one direction. If you have communal tables, remove chairs so people are separated and place a moveable partition between people. Partitions can be Plexiglas, or as simple as clear flexible plastic or even cardboard. The height and length should cover the exhale area. Buffet cafeterias: Convert any buffet service to pre-packed meal service. Have people move in one direction. Timing: Stagger arrival times, departure times and lunch times. Smoking areas: An often-overlooked high-transmission area. Space out ashbins, add distance markers and remind staff of the risk. Ventilation HVAC updates: Consider setting the HVAC unit to “always on” instead of “automatic” to ensure continuous air circulation during work hours. This will only increase your utility bill a few dollars a day or around 5%, based on “always on” for 16 hours a day. Filters: Check your HVAC filters and ensure you have at least MERV Level 10 or up to Level 13 installed, depending on the strength of your HVAC unit. This is a cost-effective measure, with filters for as little as $13 per unit. Duct cleaning: Get your air ducts professionally cleaned. COVID-19 particles are more likely to linger when they are covered in dust. Rest areas: For staff rest areas where workers cannot wear masks (e.g., eating), consider installing portable HEPA air filters near the doors and away from seating areas. Circulation: Opening windows is always a natural way to help improve air circulation in any space. Hygiene Increase sanitization of high-touch areas: Ensure high-touch areas like doorknobs, credit/debit terminals, keyboards, cupboards, drawers, windows, light switches, elevator buttons and others are regularly sanitized. Additional cleaning services: Consider investing in increased professional cleaning services to help provide an additional layer of protection. Provide hand sanitizer: Ensure there is an ample amount of hand sanitizer available. Considerations for customer-facing environments Masks: Enforce mask wearing for all customers and ensure you have extra masks on hand. Point of sale: Make sure your debit/credit terminal machines are facing towards the customer, additional screens/barriers are installed between customers and staff and that employees are sanitizing the space and any touched products between each customer. Debit/credit terminals can be wrapped with clear thick plastic to allow for disinfecting without damaging the equipment. Sanitization: Ensure frequent sanitization for high-touch areas including shopping baskets, door handles, credit/debit terminals, credit/debit terminals, etc. Distancing: Ensure at least six feet of distance between seating areas and either remove or block off extra seating areas to help preserve the distance. In addition, consider screens or barriers between tables or booths in eating areas for additional protection when the customer is not wearing a mask. Stand markers: Ensure there are clearly indicated stand markers for areas where line-ups occur. Restrooms: If your business has public restrooms, consider closing every other stall and taping off every other sink to maintain distancing. Capacity limits: There are several apps available now to help enable counting customers upon entry and exit, such as Customer Counter or Count Me In. Personal service businesses can manage headcount by appointment only. Dealing with anti-maskers Despite broad adoption of masks, there are still anti-maskers who approach businesses to make a statement. They cause a disturbance and sometimes film the incident to post on social media. From the initial interactions, anti-maskers are easily differentiated from those who are unable to wear a mask for health reasons. Operators are in their full right to protect their employees and customers on their private property. Employees should politely remind the customer that masks are required in the workplace/store and offer free single-use masks; point the customer to online shopping or take out; or offer to complete the shopping for the person while they wait outside. If all options are rejected, firmly establish that legally, requiring mask wearing is not a violation of human rights. Operators are in their full right to protect their employees and customers on their private property and call always call the police. Employees who refuse to wear a mask at work should face disciplinary action. Wearing a mask is now considered a mandatory personal protective equipment and, thus, treated with the same enforcement as other PPE such as steel-toed shoes and hard hats. Workplace Screening and Rapid Testing As rapid test kits become more widely available, businesses should consider what an appropriate deployment looks like in their physical environment. Several resources exist on how to source and implement full-scale rapid testing in your workplace, including “how-to” guides for testing from the Creative Destruction Lab Rapid Screening Consortium and the Communitech StaySafeTM at work toolkit. What to do when a positive case occurs? Despite best efforts, positive cases do occur in the workplace. It is important to have a response plan that includes communications protocols with employees and, if applicable, the public. Section V of our toolkit discusses how to respond. For the full scope of our workplace screening and rapid testing recommendations, please view Section IV and V of our Workplace Recovery Toolkit, here. Communications amidst Reopening Communications is always important to ensure your staff, customers, suppliers and the general public understand the situation, what your business has to offer and what to expect from your business. This is especially true during times of crisis when there is a great deal of uncertainty. This section of the toolkit provides guidance, examples and access to ready-made posters and graphics as well as a template you can customize for your own needs. This advice contained in this section will likely need to be customized for your specific operation. A Communications Guide The goals of your communications activities are: To ensure your staff, customers and suppliers have a clear understanding of the situation and rules that are in place. To explain the roles, responsibilities and procedures your staff, customers and suppliers must abide by. To provide confidence that your business is being safely operated. Your audiences for these communications are: Your staff, including volunteers and family members lending a hand. Your customers. Your suppliers, including couriers and other delivery services. Depending on the nature of your business, you likely have numerous communications channels at your disposal to convey the required information, including: A staff email list and phone numbers. A customer email list or newsletter. A supplier email list and phone numbers. Direct mail or unaddressed ad mail. Social media. Traditional paid advertising (billboards, newspaper, TV, radio, etc.) Space inside or around your business for signage. For internal communications with your staff, consider sending an email outlining: The procedures they will need to follow. How they can respond to questions from customers and suppliers. How they can address customers and suppliers who may not be following the health and safety procedures. How they can participate in ensuring a safe environment for staff, customers and suppliers alike. In addition to the email, it may also be advisable to conduct a teleconference or video conference with staff prior to their arrival on site in order to provide additional re-orientation and address any questions or concerns they may have, including about proper PPE usage. When onsite, conduct a walk-through with staff and highlight any changes from previous operations. Finally, signage/posters in staff areas of your business can provide guidance and reminders related to proper hygiene, social distancing and PPE usage. Template and ready-made posters are provided below. For external communications with customers and suppliers, much of the same health and safety information and procedural instructions must be conveyed. In your communications with customers, consider being proactive in an email or newsletter and on your website and social media ahead of your reopening. Tell customers and suppliers: When you will be reopening. Your hours of operation. The rules they will need to follow and any impacts this may have on your services. Providing clear expectations and practical instructions ahead of time will help ensure everyone is on the same page, avoid disappointment if there are some service disruptions and help enable smooth operations. Additional signage/posters in your business are also important to ensure everyone onsite has important information readily available about procedures (for example, where to form socially distant lines at the checkout counter) and health and safety protections (such as the use of PPE, hand sanitizer stations and social distancing). Remember that not everyone visiting your operation will have seen your proactive communications. If you have the budget and/or capacity, consider also including this information in any flyers or print advertising your business is using. As the pandemic continues and the rules in place change, follow-up communications with staff, customers and suppliers will likely be required through the same channels outlined above. Additionally, it may be helpful to provide a Q&A or Frequently Asked Questions document, if you find you or your staff are regularly being asked similar questions as the situation carries on. Above all, work to ensure your staff, customers and suppliers are informed about what is going on and how they can contribute to a successful outcome. It is important for everyone to be aware that we are all in this together. Template and Ready-made Signage Making use of clear, highly visible signage within your business to promote good health and safety practices is important to providing a safe environment for your staff, your customers, your suppliers and yourself. It is likely appropriate to post signage in both staff and public areas to ensure everyone onsite is aware of important health and safety information in all areas of your facility. Signage may also be used to help explain procedures that are in place to allow your business to operate amid COVID-19, including basic information such as the location of hand sanitizer stations, where to form lines and reminders to respect social distancing measures. In posting signage, it is good to remember to ensure signs: Provide clear information using straightforward language. Are easily legible. Balance the need to provide sufficient information with the need to avoid a jumble. Health and Safety Signage from the Government of Canada (PDFs): Poster: About coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Infographic: Know the facts about COVID-19 Poster: Help reduce the spread of COVID-19 Poster: Cleaning and disinfecting public spaces during COVID-19 Infographic: Wash your hands Poster: Physical distancing Infographic (three pages): Preventing COVID-19 in the workplace Additional health and safety awareness graphics and information from the Government of Canada are available here. Financial, HR and Pay Considerations When implementing an array of new procedures, protocols and guidelines, it is important to ensure your staff is aware and that any relevant human resource protocols are implemented. Onboarding new hires during a pandemic Ensure any onboarding and training materials include COVID-19 safety measures. This includes any mandatory procedures upon arrival (e.g., screening, temperature check and hand sanitizing), expectations of the employee to report any symptoms of COVID-19, mandatory masks in the workplace, how to handle interactions with customers). You may also consider implementing a new rapid screening requirement on the new hire’s first day. Employee training on COVID-19 protocols Once you have undertaken the work to develop new procedures, ensure you have adequate training for your employees. This training can be in several forms, and businesses are encouraged to undertake several methods of communication and training. Options include: Virtual training sessions Socially distanced in-person training sessions Walkthroughs of new procedures on first day of reopening Memos sent via email outlining new procedures, obligations and operating plans New procedures for interacting with clients or customers Ensuring a physical copy of the new rules are available in the workplace, in addition to signage around the workplace reminding employees of the new policies. Laminated versions will make cleaning easier. Ensuring all employees have access to the latest official information and what to do if they test positive Provincial workers’ compensation boards Ensure you review your local province or territory’s worker compensation board policies to understand what your obligations are under various scenarios. For example, Ontario requires employers to submit an Employer’s Report of Injury/Illness (Form 7) to the WSIB in certain cases of exposure or potential exposure. Check with your local workers’ compensation board for the most relevant information in your jurisdiction at the following link: https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/information/wcb_canada.html Pay protection While the federal government has introduced a number of support programs, including paid sick leave, it is important to review your company’s existing benefits and communicate these to employees. Consider implementing additional, temporary support measures for employees who are confirmed positive, who live in a household with someone who has confirmed positive or who have been exposed and are awaiting test results.

Ontario: Support for businesses Prince Edward Island: Supports and Services Quebec: Financial assistance Saskatchewan: Support for Businesses Yukon: Support for businesses Childcare and Social Services As most economic reopening plans across Canada involve several stages, a challenge to overcome is the inconsistent availability of childcare and other social services as employees return to the workplace. This is particularly the case when faced with school or daycare shutdowns. This unprecedented situation necessitates flexibility by all involved to ensure children and other dependents can be cared for at the same time as businesses reopen. This means some staff may need to work from home or work part-time while some may not be immediately available to return to the workplace. Information throughout the pandemic has indicated that women have been predominantly affected by this scenario, with a disproportionate number being forced out of the labour market as a result. Information on the availability of childcare and social services is provided for each province/territory below.

The legal landscape is still evolving as the legal community tries to figure out how to balance competing rights. It is important for companies to keep aware of legal developments, which will become particularly important as public health restrictions are loosened, including, eventually, when wearing masks is not mandatory. Customers and Safety Protocols Businesses will unfortunately face situations where customers refuse to follow safety protocols. Businesses should not hesitate to politely remind customers of the need to follow local regulations. Lax adherence to protocols not only creates unsafe work environments but also risks the imposition of fines from local bylaw officers. It will also be important to check your local region’s rules to confirm whether your business, the customer or both will receive the fine for non-compliance and ensure you are following all proper procedures accordingly. Employees and Employers Employers should expect hesitancy from some employees on returning to physical workspaces, particularly for those who have had prolonged work from home situations since the start of the pandemic. Having a robust set of protection measures and training in place will help build employee confidence. There are also likely limitations on the ability of companies to compel their employees to undergo rapid testing in the workplace, if the company decides to go down that route. Vaccines Despite vaccine deployment still ramping up, it is important to start to think now about how you may want to account for vaccination rates within your workforce. Our vaccine resource hub has more information. For the full scope of ourguidance surrounding vaccines, please view Section VIII of our Workplace Recovery Toolkit, here.

Canada needs a new plan, and businesses, no longer able to wait, are taking the lead and building the roadmap themselves,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO, Canadian Chamber of Commerce. In order to be ready for the eventual reopening, the Canadian Chamber has mapped out what a return to the physical workplace looks like. According to new Abacus Data polling done for the Canadian Chamber, Canadians have indicated the measures that would make them feel comfortable going into the workplace. Among those surveyed, 79% indicated vaccination would be a critical factor, 77% said everyone must wear masks, and 69% identified rapid screening. Helping employers address the concerns of employees and plan more carefully will help make the transition, whenever it comes, smoother for everyone. With that goal in mind, the Canadian Chamber today released the first wave of its business-led recovery plan, including new tools for small businesses and outlining the conditions needed to protect employees and customers. To enable this to be our last lockdown, the Canadian Chamber released today two critical items for businesses. A Vaccine Resource Hub to provide businesses with a one-stop shop to help them play their role in building vaccine confidence amongst their workforce. A workplace recovery toolkit provides the latest information and best practice for businesses to operate safely. Since re-opening success also relies on a partnerships with governments at all levels, the Canadian Chamber has also set out a number of areas where we need governments to act quickly to accelerate the business-led recovery, including: Governments need to improve public health frameworks, including outlining what variants of concern mean for business operations, providing a clear approach on business transparency for reporting positive cases to level the playing field, and stepping up our game on contact tracing. Businesses also need governments to step up to the plate on rapid testing, including standardizing training and enabling more lay people to increase accessibility. Businesses also need to be able to stay open if they are executing a rapid screening surveillance program as part of a multi-layered approach that includes masks and physical distancing. Governments also need to up their game on vaccine deployment. This includes a focus on essential workers in line with the National Advisory Committee on Immunization’s recommendations, publishing guidance on what vaccinated Canadians can and cannot do, and leveraging the private sector’s expertise for vaccine clinic logistics. “We’ve learned some very hard lessons from the past two lockdowns, and the cost has been measured in tens of thousands of closed businesses on Main Streets across the country. We simply cannot repeat the mistakes of the past, and in the absence of a plan from our governments, businesses are outlining, in crystal clear terms, what they need to make sure this is the last lockdown. Will governments heed their call and help us lead Canada back to economic health?” added Beatty. For more information about this: Abacus Date poll, click here. Vaccine Resource Hub, click here.

Methodology The survey was conducted with 2,000 Canadian adults of which 1,056 were currently employed either full-time or part-time from March 25 to 30, 2021. A random sample of panelists were invited to complete the survey from a set of partner panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. These partners are typically double opt-in survey panels, blended to manage out potential skews in the data from a single source. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 2,000 Canadians is +/- 2.19%, 19 times out of 20. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 1,056 employed Canadians is +/- 3.1%, 19 times out of 20. The base sample were weighted according to census data to ensure that the sample matched Canada’s population according to age, gender, educational attainment, and region. Totals may not add up to 100 due to rounding.

562915,20210416,chamber.ca,https://chamber.ca/campaign/our-trading-future/,text/html,text/html,en,"Our Trading Future - Canadian Chamber of Commerce LOGIN ABOUT fr Advocacy Programs & Services Resources Publications Events News Membership About fr Login ADVOCACY / CAMPAIGNS / Our Trading Future Renewing the Canada-U.S. Relationship Amid a global pandemic and economic uncertainty, Canada and the United States each face a time of transition given we are each other’s most important trading partner. This period of transition in turn creates additional uncertainty – and opportunity – for businesses on both sides of the border. In this time, a renewed focus on building trade security and resiliency are of vital interest for Canadians and Americans alike. In the U.S., despite a change in Administration, the protectionism remains. As America’s international relationships are rebooted with a new Administration, the importance of trade to businesses, consumers and decision makers in Canada and the U.S. is critical, as is the importance of renewed collaboration on shared global challenges. Unfortunately protectionism remains economically harmful, and yet is popular for many American politicians on both sides of the aisle. For the Canadian government, there is a long list of bilateral issues that are taken up with the Americans, and it is critical that economic matters remain a priority. Given both countries reliance on trade and maintaining as agile a border as possible, business needs to ensure they have a voice and this has taken on a new imperative in the context of our economic recovery from COVID-19. This is a critical year to ensure the foundations of the commercial relationships are strong to deliver business-friendly and citizen-friendly outcomes. Our Canada-U.S. trading future depends on getting this right. Key Focus Areas In order to renew the Canada-U.S. relationship, promote growth, and improve our shared security and resiliency, there are several key areas that demand attention. They are: Regulatory Cooperation Buy American Defence and Security Energy and Environment Canada-U.S. Border Reinvigorating regulatory dialogues to move forward priority areas of benefit to business communities on both sides of the border. Closer cooperation with an eye to eliminating duplication of processes will reduce red tape for business and help people access products consistently and with less delay. The Canada-U.S. economic relationship is one of, if not the most, integrated relationships on the planet. Buy American policies that include critical Canadian supply chains therefore produce negative results for Americans and Canadians alike. It is in the best interests of ordinary people on both sides of the border to ensure a strong, integrated partnership continues. Similar to the Canada-U.S. economic relationship, the defence and security relationship is extensive and mutually beneficial. Both countries are also working to ensure resiliency, industrial development, and mutual security. As with other areas of U.S. economic protectionism, defence protectionism endangers American resiliency and security. Both countries share the goal of creating sustainable, environmentally-friendly solutions to our challenges. To that end, it is therefore natural to produce binational approaches to energy security, COP 26, and other issues. Enhancing work on critical minerals to accelerate current discussions to respond to supply chain risks would also help support the transition to a lower carbon economy. The COVID-19 Pandemic has provided a stark reminder of the importance of the Canada-U.S. relationship, including the critical nature of an open border between the two countries. As the pandemic moves towards a conclusion, establishing clear and predictable rules that will enable a resumption of business and leisure travel is critical to provide predictability for businesses and citizens alike.

Abacus Data completed the polling for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce by Abacus Data. Today, slightly more than 1 in 2 Canadians (51 per cent) are still going into the workplace most of the time, with another 12 per cent splitting their time between the workplace and working from home. Only 36 per cent are working from home full time. Asked when they thought their workplace would return to normal, nearly half of Canadians (45 per cent) did not believe that would occur until 2022. “It’s clear that Canadians and their employers have been adapting to work and life during the COVID-19 pandemic, doing their part to keep us safe and carrying the Canadian economy on their shoulders. Their pessimism about the return to normal may speak to broader concerns about our country’s slow pace at vaccinating and the need for a concrete plan for what comes next. While they see what good planning looks like in workplaces, they also hope to see our political leaders set a clear pathway out of this pandemic,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Canada’s largest business association. The poll also showed half of Canadians had never worked from home before the pandemic. The pandemic’s shift to remote work may not be as extensive as originally thought, with the data showing a rise from 23% to 36% for those Canadians working mostly from home. While 27% of Canadians said they were working from home some of the time before the pandemic, now only 12% say they are splitting their time between the workplace and home. For those Canadians going into the workplace, 4 out of 5 feel safe doing so. Conversely, only 1 in 2 of those working from home most or part of the time feel safe about the prospect of returning to their workplaces. The data suggests the majority of Canadians already going into the workplace most of the time are seeing the right safety precautions to keep them feeling safe. Regardless of where they worked, the key concerns for returning to a workplace full-time were exposure to customers coming into the office and using public transit for the work commute. Not surprisingly, the data shows these concerns are most apparent for those working in small retail/food service businesses dependent on a physical presence. The Canadian Chamber and our members are working hard to support vaccination, rapid screening, and PPE programs across the country to lower the risk of infection from in-person interactions. Today’s data also helps narrow down where smaller businesses should invest in PPE and new processes to help protect their employees and make them more comfortable. “As vaccines begin to roll out, more and more Canadians are asking what is the bridge between now and completion of mass vaccination? Part of that question is what a return to the physical workplace looks like. Helping employers address their concerns and plan more carefully will help make the transition, whenever it comes, smoother for everyone. The sooner our governments can provide a roadmap, the better,” said Trevin Stratton, Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, Policy. The Canadian Chamber and Abacus will next examine what makes Canadians feel safe or unsafe about their current workplace or their return to a physical workplace. For more information about the poll, click here. Methodology The survey was conducted with 2,000 Canadian adults of which 1,056 were currently employed either full-time or part-time from March 25 to 30, 2021. A random sample of panelists were invited to complete the survey from a set of partner panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. These partners are typically double opt-in survey panels, blended to manage out potential skews in the data from a single source. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 2,000 Canadians is +/- 2.19%, 19 times out of 20. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 1,056 employed Canadians is +/- 3.1%, 19 times out of 20. The base sample were weighted according to census data to ensure that the sample matched Canada’s population according to age, gender, educational attainment, and region. Totals may not add up to 100 due to rounding.

This is when economic slack will be absorbed and Canada might be looking at an increase in interest rates. Today’s Monetary Policy Report states that after a strong consumption-led recovery in 2021, growth is projected to ease over 2022 and 2023 and become ‘self-sustaining.’ This creates two challenges for policy makers. First, how to avoid growth easing back to our mediocre pre-pandemic levels. And, second, how public investment can best provide value for money in terms of growth if it is already projected to be self-sustaining. The key factor will be focusing on Canada’s flagging investment levels. Recessions lead to declining investment spending and the pandemic downturn is no different. Our leading growth drivers this year are projected to be consumption, housing, and government spending, in that order, with business fixed investment bringing up the rear. Given Canada’s disappointing investment levels prior to pandemic, we cannot go back to the status quo ante after our initial economic rebound. Less capital investment today means lower levels of economic production in the future. What remains uncertain is our ability to engineer longer-term growth and recovery. Even mild recessions can lead to long-lasting damage to the situations of individuals and businesses, as well as economic fundamentals more broadly. This is known as economic scarring. The consequences of high unemployment, falling incomes, and reduced economic activity can have lingering effects even after an initial rebound that can last for years. This week’s federal budget addressed some economic scars, such as the focus on lasting effects in the labour market. However, it will also be important that we address any long-term investment scars. To do so, our growth drivers will need to shift from public spending to private investment to propel recovery and help get our finances under control. According to today’s economic outlook, our business investment is projected to remain relatively flat during recovery, contributing 0.5 percentage points to growth this year and 0.7 percentage points in 2022 and 2023. The exceptionally high growth rates we will see when the pandemic subsides later this year will be something for all of us to celebrate, but we should also be concerned about forward looking business investment levels. While economies often see rapid growth during an initial rebound as unused capacity is returned to work, the drag due to the long-term damage can still prevent the recovery from reaching its full potential. The economic impact on investment will linger long after we are able to put the pandemic itself in the rear view mirror. Canada’s recovery plan should focus on healing these investment wounds so our pandemic scars don’t limit our future prosperity.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

As employers and providers of goods and services to the general public, businesses have a critical role to play in getting Canadians vaccinated, which will ultimately create the conditions for the relaxation of public health restrictions currently in place. Given the overwhelming volume of information available on vaccines, this resource hub provides companies of all sizes with a single focal point for the information they need to know as employers and the resources they can use to reassure and encourage their employees to get vaccinated. Vaccine 101 Vaccine Distribution Business Tips Talking to Your Employees Knowing the facts about vaccines is critical, which is not always easy given the breadth of resources out there. Vaccines have been robustly tested in clinical trials around the world to confirm their safety and efficacy. There are a number of resources that can provide businesses the facts on vaccines, which will ultimately equip owners and operators to engage their employees. COVID-19 vaccines authorized in Canada is the Government of Canada’s primary resource page for up-to-date information about the vaccines authorized in Canada. Vaccine development and approval in Canada is a resource that explains the rigorous scientific process involved in developing a new vaccine and conducting clinical trials as well as the process Health Canada follows to review and approve vaccines. There is also a video available on vaccine development and approval. Below are Health Canada’s resources for each authorized vaccine, including how the vaccine works, how it is administered, possible side effects and vaccine safety after authorization: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine Some provincial jurisdictions are supporting the ability of companies to act as vaccine distribution hubs for the general public and their employees. Other jurisdictions are providing multiple avenues for the general population, particularly those in essential sectors — such as food processing and distribution or construction — to receive a vaccination before the general public. Vaccines and treatments for COVID-19: Vaccine rollout describes the vaccine deliveries to provinces and where vaccines have been distributed to date. Each province or territory has a detailed vaccine rollout plan and booking system: Alberta British Columbia (find your local BC public health unit) Manitoba New Brunswick Newfoundland and Labrador Northwest Territories Nova Scotia Nunavut Ontario (find your local Ontario public health unit) For Businesses: the Ontario Chamber of Commerce’s Vaccination Support Council is a resource for companies to assist in vaccine distribution through supporting public health units or offering a workplace as a site for vaccination Prince Edward Island (PEI vaccine rollout updates can be found here) Quebec For Businesses: Quebec’s Vaccination Enterprise site is available for companies to participate in setting up a vaccination site for their employees or by meeting human and material resource needs Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan’s vaccine plan updates can be found here) Yukon Vaccines are very safe, but as with all medicines, there is the potential for side effects after administration. Possible side effects for COVID-19 vaccines are very minor and may include redness, soreness or swelling on the arm that received the shot, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and mild fever. Read more about vaccine safety and possible side effects. There are active ways employers can help their workforce get vaccinated since it is ultimately the collection of individual and company-level decisions that make a difference. Depending on your company’s financial capacity, there are several practical things your company can do to help your employees get vaccinated: Offer paid time off to any employee to get vaccinated. Potentially as much as four to six hours depending where vaccine clinics are located. Provide a transportation voucher (i.e. Uber/Lyft gift card, bus pass) to help cover your employees’ transportation costs to and from a vaccine site. Reimburse the employees’ childcare expenses during their vaccine appointments up to a certain amount. Offer internet access or language support services to help employees schedule their appointment when it becomes available. Provide information to your employees on the local public health or provincial vaccine timelines via email or printouts on a staff board in a common area. Offer paid leave of one to two days if needed after vaccination. Companies should also start thinking about how to appropriately collect vaccine KPIs amongst their workforce while respecting the privacy of their employees. One option could be undertaking voluntary surveys to understand whether their workforce has received one or two doses of the vaccine, if they intend to receive the vaccine or if they prefer to not disclose. It is also critical to manage expectations for those who get vaccinated with their first or second dose. You should ensure your employees can expect public health guidance to continue to focus on handwashing, masks and physical distancing. This will help manage expectations and reduce any issues with workplace tension between those who are vaccinated and those who are not. Whether by staff meetings, emails or casual 1:1 conversations, employers have countless touchpoints every day to speak with their employees about vaccines. The choice to get vaccinated is ultimately with the individual, but the conversations you have will affect not only your employees but also the information they share with their friends and family about vaccines. These are the top tips for talking to your employees, which have been adapted from the Health Action Alliance: Listening Is Key: You need to have a conversation with your staff rather than a debate. Their decision to get vaccinated is theirs to make, which should always be acknowledged. Focus on being inviting and respectful and encourage them to look at information from respected sources. Lead with Empathy: It is important to acknowledge people’s concerns given it has been a difficult time for Canadians during the pandemic. It is okay for people — even you — to have questions about vaccines given the rate at which news changes and the wide number of voices in media and social media. Do not be condescending. Instead, support your staff taking time off for their vaccination or helping their family members. Facts about Safety Matter: Speak in plain language with people. Provide facts from reputable sources but don’t make up what you don’t know or use information from unreputable sources, particularly on social media. You also cannot provide medical advice to people’s unique health circumstances. Be Authentic: Share why you have decided to get vaccinated and why it is important for you and your family.

National Reopening Government Regulation Tracker In order to operate, businesses must abide by all national, provincial/territorial and local codes issued by our governments. This includes when and which businesses are allowed to open, an array of health and safety measures, social distancing standards, occupancy limits and more. The new rules will inform how your operations and health and safety standards must be adapted to the current situation. Due to ongoing changes in the regulatory landscape, please find current information on this dedicated regulation tracking page. Personal Protective Equipment Workplace Layout and Operations Workplace Screening and Rapid Testing Communications amidst Reopening Financial, HR, and Pay Considerations Childcare and Social Services Legal and Liability Additional Resources and Guides Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Reopening the economy — and keeping it open — hinges on our collective ability to maintain the health and safety for our staff and customers. If we are unable to succeed in this objective, governments will continue to be in the cycle of ordering business closures. Measures surrounding the use of PPE — including what types are required, when it is needed, how to use it — should be included in your health and safety plan. Business operators should build a culture of safety, and that begins with ensuring all leaders and employees are using the proper PPE for your setting. The types of PPE your business requires will depend on a variety of situations (e.g., office, storefront, manufacturing, indoor vs. outdoor conditions). Information on PPE is available from the federal government (general information | authorized PPE products). Workplace Layout and Operations Introducing a new workplace layout is one of the most important considerations a business must make before reopening. It is important to keep track of any changing requirements between different phases or zones of lockdowns. When arranging your new layout, there are several things to consider. Space out workers: Ensure there is at least six feet between workstations or stagger desks where possible. Consider adding screens or cubicle walls between desks to help prevent the spread of the virus. If your business is responsible for washroom areas, consider closing every other stall and taping off every other sink to maintain distancing. Physical barriers: If distancing is not physically possible, ensure you have stringent screening measures in place, increased handwashing procedures and signage and additional PPE where possible. Room capacities: Each room should have a capacity limit sign on the door that states the maximum capacity, limited to the number of people who can be in the room seated two metres apart. Distancing markers: Ensure there are stand markers at least six feet apart indicating where customers can stand or where employees must wait. This is important for high-traffic areas such as entrances, lobbies, check-out areas, delivery zones, office common areas (kitchen, boardroom, washroom), etc. Consider adding additional space for seating areas, particularly if customers or workers will be eating in this space with their masks off. Operating Tactics: Eating at Work Lunchrooms: Any time you are with other people in close proximity without wearing a mask is considered high risk. Space out tables two feet from each other. Have everyone face in one direction. If you have communal tables, remove chairs so people are separated and place a moveable partition between people. Partitions can be Plexiglas, or as simple as clear flexible plastic or even cardboard. The height and length should cover the exhale area. Buffet cafeterias: Convert any buffet service to pre-packed meal service. Have people move in one direction. Timing: Stagger arrival times, departure times and lunch times. Smoking areas: An often-overlooked high-transmission area. Space out ashbins, add distance markers and remind staff of the risk. Ventilation HVAC updates: Consider setting the HVAC unit to “always on” instead of “automatic” to ensure continuous air circulation during work hours. This will only increase your utility bill a few dollars a day or around 5%, based on “always on” for 16 hours a day. Filters: Check your HVAC filters and ensure you have at least MERV Level 10 or up to Level 13 installed, depending on the strength of your HVAC unit. This is a cost-effective measure, with filters for as little as $13 per unit. Duct cleaning: Get your air ducts professionally cleaned. COVID-19 particles are more likely to linger when they are covered in dust. Rest areas: For staff rest areas where workers cannot wear masks (e.g., eating), consider installing portable HEPA air filters near the doors and away from seating areas. Circulation: Opening windows is always a natural way to help improve air circulation in any space. Hygiene Increase sanitization of high-touch areas: Ensure high-touch areas like doorknobs, credit/debit terminals, keyboards, cupboards, drawers, windows, light switches, elevator buttons and others are regularly sanitized. Additional cleaning services: Consider investing in increased professional cleaning services to help provide an additional layer of protection. Provide hand sanitizer: Ensure there is an ample amount of hand sanitizer available. Considerations for customer-facing environments Masks: Enforce mask wearing for all customers and ensure you have extra masks on hand. Point of sale: Make sure your debit/credit terminal machines are facing towards the customer, additional screens/barriers are installed between customers and staff and that employees are sanitizing the space and any touched products between each customer. Debit/credit terminals can be wrapped with clear thick plastic to allow for disinfecting without damaging the equipment. Sanitization: Ensure frequent sanitization for high-touch areas including shopping baskets, door handles, credit/debit terminals, credit/debit terminals, etc. Distancing: Ensure at least six feet of distance between seating areas and either remove or block off extra seating areas to help preserve the distance. In addition, consider screens or barriers between tables or booths in eating areas for additional protection when the customer is not wearing a mask. Stand markers: Ensure there are clearly indicated stand markers for areas where line-ups occur. Restrooms: If your business has public restrooms, consider closing every other stall and taping off every other sink to maintain distancing. Capacity limits: There are several apps available now to help enable counting customers upon entry and exit, such as Customer Counter or Count Me In. Personal service businesses can manage headcount by appointment only. Dealing with anti-maskers Despite broad adoption of masks, there are still anti-maskers who approach businesses to make a statement. They cause a disturbance and sometimes film the incident to post on social media. From the initial interactions, anti-maskers are easily differentiated from those who are unable to wear a mask for health reasons. Operators are in their full right to protect their employees and customers on their private property. Employees should politely remind the customer that masks are required in the workplace/store and offer free single-use masks; point the customer to online shopping or take out; or offer to complete the shopping for the person while they wait outside. If all options are rejected, firmly establish that legally, requiring mask wearing is not a violation of human rights. Operators are in their full right to protect their employees and customers on their private property and call always call the police. Employees who refuse to wear a mask at work should face disciplinary action. Wearing a mask is now considered a mandatory personal protective equipment and, thus, treated with the same enforcement as other PPE such as steel-toed shoes and hard hats. Workplace Screening and Rapid Testing As rapid test kits become more widely available, businesses should consider what an appropriate deployment looks like in their physical environment. Several resources exist on how to source and implement full-scale rapid testing in your workplace, including “how-to” guides for testing from the Creative Destruction Lab Rapid Screening Consortium and the Communitech StaySafeTM at work toolkit. What to do when a positive case occurs? Despite best efforts, positive cases do occur in the workplace. It is important to have a response plan that includes communications protocols with employees and, if applicable, the public. Section V of our toolkit discusses how to respond. For the full scope of our workplace screening and rapid testing recommendations, please view Section IV and V of our Workplace Recovery Toolkit, here. Communications amidst Reopening Communications is always important to ensure your staff, customers, suppliers and the general public understand the situation, what your business has to offer and what to expect from your business. This is especially true during times of crisis when there is a great deal of uncertainty. This section of the toolkit provides guidance, examples and access to ready-made posters and graphics as well as a template you can customize for your own needs. This advice contained in this section will likely need to be customized for your specific operation. A Communications Guide The goals of your communications activities are: To ensure your staff, customers and suppliers have a clear understanding of the situation and rules that are in place. To explain the roles, responsibilities and procedures your staff, customers and suppliers must abide by. To provide confidence that your business is being safely operated. Your audiences for these communications are: Your staff, including volunteers and family members lending a hand. Your customers. Your suppliers, including couriers and other delivery services. Depending on the nature of your business, you likely have numerous communications channels at your disposal to convey the required information, including: A staff email list and phone numbers. A customer email list or newsletter. A supplier email list and phone numbers. Direct mail or unaddressed ad mail. Social media. Traditional paid advertising (billboards, newspaper, TV, radio, etc.) Space inside or around your business for signage. For internal communications with your staff, consider sending an email outlining: The procedures they will need to follow. How they can respond to questions from customers and suppliers. How they can address customers and suppliers who may not be following the health and safety procedures. How they can participate in ensuring a safe environment for staff, customers and suppliers alike. In addition to the email, it may also be advisable to conduct a teleconference or video conference with staff prior to their arrival on site in order to provide additional re-orientation and address any questions or concerns they may have, including about proper PPE usage. When onsite, conduct a walk-through with staff and highlight any changes from previous operations. Finally, signage/posters in staff areas of your business can provide guidance and reminders related to proper hygiene, social distancing and PPE usage. Template and ready-made posters are provided below. For external communications with customers and suppliers, much of the same health and safety information and procedural instructions must be conveyed. In your communications with customers, consider being proactive in an email or newsletter and on your website and social media ahead of your reopening. Tell customers and suppliers: When you will be reopening. Your hours of operation. The rules they will need to follow and any impacts this may have on your services. Providing clear expectations and practical instructions ahead of time will help ensure everyone is on the same page, avoid disappointment if there are some service disruptions and help enable smooth operations. Additional signage/posters in your business are also important to ensure everyone onsite has important information readily available about procedures (for example, where to form socially distant lines at the checkout counter) and health and safety protections (such as the use of PPE, hand sanitizer stations and social distancing). Remember that not everyone visiting your operation will have seen your proactive communications. If you have the budget and/or capacity, consider also including this information in any flyers or print advertising your business is using. As the pandemic continues and the rules in place change, follow-up communications with staff, customers and suppliers will likely be required through the same channels outlined above. Additionally, it may be helpful to provide a Q&A or Frequently Asked Questions document, if you find you or your staff are regularly being asked similar questions as the situation carries on. Above all, work to ensure your staff, customers and suppliers are informed about what is going on and how they can contribute to a successful outcome. It is important for everyone to be aware that we are all in this together. Template and Ready-made Signage Making use of clear, highly visible signage within your business to promote good health and safety practices is important to providing a safe environment for your staff, your customers, your suppliers and yourself. It is likely appropriate to post signage in both staff and public areas to ensure everyone onsite is aware of important health and safety information in all areas of your facility. Signage may also be used to help explain procedures that are in place to allow your business to operate amid COVID-19, including basic information such as the location of hand sanitizer stations, where to form lines and reminders to respect social distancing measures. In posting signage, it is good to remember to ensure signs: Provide clear information using straightforward language. Are easily legible. Balance the need to provide sufficient information with the need to avoid a jumble. Health and Safety Signage from the Government of Canada (PDFs): Poster: About coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Infographic: Know the facts about COVID-19 Poster: Help reduce the spread of COVID-19 Poster: Cleaning and disinfecting public spaces during COVID-19 Infographic: Wash your hands Poster: Physical distancing Infographic (three pages): Preventing COVID-19 in the workplace Additional health and safety awareness graphics and information from the Government of Canada are available here. Financial, HR and Pay Considerations When implementing an array of new procedures, protocols and guidelines, it is important to ensure your staff is aware and that any relevant human resource protocols are implemented. Onboarding new hires during a pandemic Ensure any onboarding and training materials include COVID-19 safety measures. This includes any mandatory procedures upon arrival (e.g., screening, temperature check and hand sanitizing), expectations of the employee to report any symptoms of COVID-19, mandatory masks in the workplace, how to handle interactions with customers). You may also consider implementing a new rapid screening requirement on the new hire’s first day. Employee training on COVID-19 protocols Once you have undertaken the work to develop new procedures, ensure you have adequate training for your employees. This training can be in several forms, and businesses are encouraged to undertake several methods of communication and training. Options include: Virtual training sessions Socially distanced in-person training sessions Walkthroughs of new procedures on first day of reopening Memos sent via email outlining new procedures, obligations and operating plans New procedures for interacting with clients or customers Ensuring a physical copy of the new rules are available in the workplace, in addition to signage around the workplace reminding employees of the new policies. Laminated versions will make cleaning easier. Ensuring all employees have access to the latest official information and what to do if they test positive Provincial workers’ compensation boards Ensure you review your local province or territory’s worker compensation board policies to understand what your obligations are under various scenarios. For example, Ontario requires employers to submit an Employer’s Report of Injury/Illness (Form 7) to the WSIB in certain cases of exposure or potential exposure. Check with your local workers’ compensation board for the most relevant information in your jurisdiction at the following link: https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/information/wcb_canada.html Pay protection While the federal government has introduced a number of support programs, including paid sick leave, it is important to review your company’s existing benefits and communicate these to employees. Consider implementing additional, temporary support measures for employees who are confirmed positive, who live in a household with someone who has confirmed positive or who have been exposed and are awaiting test results.

This is particularly the case when faced with school or daycare shutdowns. This unprecedented situation necessitates flexibility by all involved to ensure children and other dependents can be cared for at the same time as businesses reopen. This means some staff may need to work from home or work part-time while some may not be immediately available to return to the workplace. Information throughout the pandemic has indicated that women have been predominantly affected by this scenario, with a disproportionate number being forced out of the labour market as a result. Information on the availability of childcare and social services is provided for each province/territory below.

The legal landscape is still evolving as the legal community tries to figure out how to balance competing rights. It is important for companies to keep aware of legal developments, which will become particularly important as public health restrictions are loosened, including, eventually, when wearing masks is not mandatory. Customers and Safety Protocols Businesses will unfortunately face situations where customers refuse to follow safety protocols. Businesses should not hesitate to politely remind customers of the need to follow local regulations. Lax adherence to protocols not only creates unsafe work environments but also risks the imposition of fines from local bylaw officers. It will also be important to check your local region’s rules to confirm whether your business, the customer or both will receive the fine for non-compliance and ensure you are following all proper procedures accordingly. Employees and Employers Employers should expect hesitancy from some employees on returning to physical workspaces, particularly for those who have had prolonged work from home situations since the start of the pandemic. Having a robust set of protection measures and training in place will help build employee confidence. There are also likely limitations on the ability of companies to compel their employees to undergo rapid testing in the workplace, if the company decides to go down that route. Vaccines Despite vaccine deployment still ramping up, it is important to start to think now about how you may want to account for vaccination rates within your workforce.

Canada needs a new plan, and businesses, no longer able to wait, are taking the lead and building the roadmap themselves,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO, Canadian Chamber of Commerce. In order to be ready for the eventual reopening, the Canadian Chamber has mapped out what a return to the physical workplace looks like. According to new Abacus Data polling done for the Canadian Chamber, Canadians have indicated the measures that would make them feel comfortable going into the workplace. Among those surveyed, 79% indicated vaccination would be a critical factor, 77% said everyone must wear masks, and 69% identified rapid screening. Helping employers address the concerns of employees and plan more carefully will help make the transition, whenever it comes, smoother for everyone. With that goal in mind, the Canadian Chamber today released the first wave of its business-led recovery plan, including new tools for small businesses and outlining the conditions needed to protect employees and customers. To enable this to be our last lockdown, the Canadian Chamber released today two critical items for businesses. A Vaccine Resource Hub to provide businesses with a one-stop shop to help them play their role in building vaccine confidence amongst their workforce. A workplace recovery toolkit provides the latest information and best practice for businesses to operate safely. Since re-opening success also relies on a partnerships with governments at all levels, the Canadian Chamber has also set out a number of areas where we need governments to act quickly to accelerate the business-led recovery, including: Governments need to improve public health frameworks, including outlining what variants of concern mean for business operations, providing a clear approach on business transparency for reporting positive cases to level the playing field, and stepping up our game on contact tracing. Businesses also need governments to step up to the plate on rapid testing, including standardizing training and enabling more lay people to increase accessibility. Businesses also need to be able to stay open if they are executing a rapid screening surveillance program as part of a multi-layered approach that includes masks and physical distancing. Governments also need to up their game on vaccine deployment. This includes a focus on essential workers in line with the National Advisory Committee on Immunization’s recommendations, publishing guidance on what vaccinated Canadians can and cannot do, and leveraging the private sector’s expertise for vaccine clinic logistics. “We’ve learned some very hard lessons from the past two lockdowns, and the cost has been measured in tens of thousands of closed businesses on Main Streets across the country. We simply cannot repeat the mistakes of the past, and in the absence of a plan from our governments, businesses are outlining, in crystal clear terms, what they need to make sure this is the last lockdown. Will governments heed their call and help us lead Canada back to economic health?” added Beatty. For more information about this: Abacus Date poll, click here. Vaccine Resource Hub, click here.

Methodology The survey was conducted with 2,000 Canadian adults of which 1,056 were currently employed either full-time or part-time from March 25 to 30, 2021. A random sample of panelists were invited to complete the survey from a set of partner panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. These partners are typically double opt-in survey panels, blended to manage out potential skews in the data from a single source. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 2,000 Canadians is +/- 2.19%, 19 times out of 20. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of 1,056 employed Canadians is +/- 3.1%, 19 times out of 20. The base sample were weighted according to census data to ensure that the sample matched Canada’s population according to age, gender, educational attainment, and region. Totals may not add up to 100 due to rounding.

This is when economic slack will be absorbed and Canada might be looking at an increase in interest rates. Today’s Monetary Policy Report states that after a strong consumption-led recovery in 2021, growth is projected to ease over 2022 and 2023 and become ‘self-sustaining.’ This creates two challenges for policy makers. First, how to avoid growth easing back to our mediocre pre-pandemic levels. And, second, how public investment can best provide value for money in terms of growth if it is already projected to be self-sustaining. The key factor will be focusing on Canada’s flagging investment levels. Recessions lead to declining investment spending and the pandemic downturn is no different. Our leading growth drivers this year are projected to be consumption, housing, and government spending, in that order, with business fixed investment bringing up the rear. Given Canada’s disappointing investment levels prior to pandemic, we cannot go back to the status quo ante after our initial economic rebound. Less capital investment today means lower levels of economic production in the future. What remains uncertain is our ability to engineer longer-term growth and recovery. Even mild recessions can lead to long-lasting damage to the situations of individuals and businesses, as well as economic fundamentals more broadly. This is known as economic scarring. The consequences of high unemployment, falling incomes, and reduced economic activity can have lingering effects even after an initial rebound that can last for years. This week’s federal budget addressed some economic scars, such as the focus on lasting effects in the labour market. However, it will also be important that we address any long-term investment scars. To do so, our growth drivers will need to shift from public spending to private investment to propel recovery and help get our finances under control. According to today’s economic outlook, our business investment is projected to remain relatively flat during recovery, contributing 0.5 percentage points to growth this year and 0.7 percentage points in 2022 and 2023. The exceptionally high growth rates we will see when the pandemic subsides later this year will be something for all of us to celebrate, but we should also be concerned about forward looking business investment levels. While economies often see rapid growth during an initial rebound as unused capacity is returned to work, the drag due to the long-term damage can still prevent the recovery from reaching its full potential. The economic impact on investment will linger long after we are able to put the pandemic itself in the rear view mirror. Canada’s recovery plan should focus on healing these investment wounds so our pandemic scars don’t limit our future prosperity.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

Connecting Canadians and goods to growth opportunities and making participation in large events safe again is critical for Canadians to live more normal lives. Although large events and widespread travel may not yet be possible, we need to be ready for the first day of reopening and not still be preparing guidelines months after they are needed,” added Beatty. The Canadian Chamber outlined key elements that need to be included in any strategy, including clear metrics for targeted travel restrictions, coherent rules across all modes of transportation, and replacing broad quarantine measures with regulations based on a combination of testing, vaccination and other measures to protect public health. The Canadian Chamber noted that the world is adopting new systems to document travelers’ health status, including digital vaccination certification. Canada needs to accelerate its efforts to catch up and to enable a speedy and safe resumption of economic activity. “As hundreds of thousands of jobs have hung in the balance, travel restrictions have created serious problems for professionals and businesses since the start of the pandemic.

The one-day event on June 23, 2021 will focus on ensuring an inclusive economic recovery is a reality. We are over a year into the pandemic, and women continue to be disproportionately affected by its effects as both employers and employees. From over-representation in some of the hardest-hit sectors, like travel, tourism, and food services and accommodation, to juggling childcare and work responsibilities, women are leaving the workforce or dropping in productivity. “This isn’t a women’s issue; it’s an economic issue,” says Leah Nord, Senior Director of Workforce Strategies and Inclusive Growth at the Canadian Chamber. “Ensuring women have opportunities to fully participate in the recovery is essential for widespread job creation and sustained economic growth. That’s what this Summit is all about. It’s about the entire business community – not only women – taking the lead to share, inspire, and generate real solutions.” By bringing together influencers, business and community leaders, the Women in Business Summit aims to mobilize the business community to take immediate action to keep women in the workforce and build their success as entrepreneurs through the pandemic’s recovery. From stories of resilience to conversations about upskilling and reskilling, creating more opportunities for underrepresented groups and the importance of addressing mental health issues, the insights gleaned through this Summit will also help provide chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and businesses across the country with practical tools and strategies. “While we want to celebrate the incredible achievements of women in our business community, the goal of this Summit is also rooted in real-world outcomes,” adds Nord. “This isn’t about buzzwords or trends — it’s about learning how we can help equip our network and businesses so they can make the necessary changes to support women and open up the full potential of the Canadian economy.” To register and learn more, visit the Women in Business Summit: Empowering an Inclusive Recovery, here.

The one-day event on June 23, 2021 will focus on ensuring an inclusive economic recovery is a reality. We are over a year into the pandemic, and women continue to be disproportionately affected by its effects as both employers and employees. From over-representation in some of the hardest-hit sectors, like travel, tourism, and food services and accommodation, to juggling childcare and work responsibilities, women are leaving the workforce or dropping in productivity. “This isn’t a women’s issue; it’s an economic issue,” says Leah Nord, Senior Director of Workforce Strategies and Inclusive Growth at the Canadian Chamber. “Ensuring women have opportunities to fully participate in the recovery is essential for widespread job creation and sustained economic growth. That’s what this Summit is all about. It’s about the entire business community – not only women – taking the lead to share, inspire, and generate real solutions.” By bringing together influencers, business and community leaders, the Women in Business Summit aims to mobilize the business community to take immediate action to keep women in the workforce and build their success as entrepreneurs through the pandemic’s recovery. From stories of resilience to conversations about upskilling and reskilling, creating more opportunities for underrepresented groups and the importance of addressing mental health issues, the insights gleaned through this Summit will also help provide chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and businesses across the country with practical tools and strategies. “While we want to celebrate the incredible achievements of women in our business community, the goal of this Summit is also rooted in real-world outcomes,” adds Nord. “This isn’t about buzzwords or trends — it’s about learning how we can help equip our network and businesses so they can make the necessary changes to support women and open up the full potential of the Canadian economy.” To register and learn more, visit the Women in Business Summit: Empowering an Inclusive Recovery, here.

Historically speaking, the odds are not in our favor because Canada’s rate of business investment has consistently been among the lowest in the OECD. Similarly, Canadian businesses had some of the largest private debt loads among G20 countries prior to the pandemic. As we look forward to a time after COVID-19, the ability of businesses to use debt to spur investment seems increasingly tenuous. Last quarter, Statistics Canada’s Canadian Survey on Business Conditions (CSBC) found 40% of Canadian businesses could not take on additional debt and 26% of Canadian businesses were unsure about their ability to take on additional debt. In other words, two thirds of Canada’s businesses had no debt options for investment. While 15% of business this quarter reported they could not take on more debt, there is still uncertainty around future revenues and how long businesses can survive. According to today’s CSBC results for the second quarter, the odds for a business investment boom look even worse. The data shows that lack of confidence, uncertainty in future sales, cash flow and expectations of being turned down are the three biggest barriers to businesses for fueling business investment when the economy reopens. Canada must collectively become growth-minded when the pandemic ends – avoiding its historic 2% growth trap. While 2% growth reduces the federal deficit, it allows the federal debt to grow and constrains economic opportunity for all Canadians. To counter the debt load hurdle and unlock business investment for growth, three things are required: Reopening the economy and avoiding further lockdowns by leveraging public health infrastructure, such as vaccines and rapid tests. Simply put, opening leads to growth, consumer spending and business confidence in future sales. Jurisdictions that leveraged public health infrastructure to remain more open, such as Australia, are showing good performance in the areas of consumer spending and business confidence. Being more ambitious in fixing Canada’s costly and burdensome regulatory environment. According to Statistics Canada’s Survey of Regulatory Compliance Costs, 2 times the number of businesses said the amount and complexity of mandatory government paperwork had increased versus stayed the same last decade. Improving Canada’s regulatory environment would reduce business costs, support cash flow and unlock new productive investments. Addressing Canada’s uncompetitive tax rates on capital. For instance, while the recent federal budget moves forward with accelerating capital cost allowance (CCA) deductions for Canadian-controlled private corporations on a temporary basis, the measure should be extended to publicly traded firms, as is typical under the CCA system.

We are very worried about a wave of business closures through 2022 as they face a tipping point of continued revenue loss and maximum indebtedness. The situation is untenable with the current one-size-fits-all approach to government support programs,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO, Canadian Chamber of Commerce. These travel, hospitality, and tourism industry sectors will remain unable to reach their full activity for many quarters. Several factors are converging to limit their recovery, including the likely uneven rollback of travel restrictions; public health regulations that limit capacity in venues; and the need to build customer confidence after a long campaign by governments to encourage Canadians to stay home and avoid large gatherings. The runway to recovery is much longer for businesses in these sectors that for others that no longer need government support. In the March 2021 the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, half of businesses in the hardest hit sectors reported they are unable to take on any more debt, compared to 34% of businesses from across all sectors. The most recent Canadian Survey on Business Conditions found that employers in the accommodation and food services sector were three times as likely to lay off staff over the next year due to depressed consumer demand. “It would be tragic to have businesses manage to survive up until now, only to have to close their doors just before they reach the goal line. It would also be a waste of the government supports they’ve received. Focusing on these few sectors that need continuing help is not only the right thing to do, but also smart policy to help millions of Canadians return to their jobs,” added Beatty. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce provided a 12-point plan to help policymakers tailor their supports for these sectors, including: The Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS) should be maintained at their current respective 75% and 65% maximum rates through to Fall 2021. CERS also needs to be expanded to work better for medium-sized businesses and for those with locations in high-cost-of-living areas. From September 2021 onwards, the CEWS and CERS programs should be retooled so they continue for the hardest hit sectors through to Spring 2022, while winding down for businesses in sectors that have recovered. Interest payments on all government-backed loans for businesses in the hardest hit sectors under the CEBA and HASCAP programs should be forgiven. Introduce a point of sale HST rebate for hospitality and entertainment activities for 2021-2023. Federal and provincial governments should make available free rapid test kits to consumer-facing businesses until they are no longer needed to protect public health. The federal government should lead in developing a national standard for provinces to implement health credentials that include vaccination status and test results, including what businesses can ask of their customers about vaccination status. The federal government should enhance the COVID-19 Alert App by ensuring all positive cases are loaded into the COVID Alert App by provincial and territorial governments, and private clinics. For more information on the Canadian Chamber’s 12-point plan, click here. The recommendations were developed with advice from the Canadian Chamber’s COVID-19 Recovery Leadership Council, a group of CEOs and senior executives from leading companies contributing their entrepreneurial skills and experience in delivering projects at scale. The goal of the council is to advise on practical solutions to reduce and ultimately eliminate COVID-19 in Canada and pave the way for a business-led economic recovery.

The nature of work has changed significantly in the last 18 months however, and our workplaces need to adapt quickly. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce today released a 21-point plan to provide guidance for businesses and policy recommendations for governments on four key areas for the re-opening of the economy: health/safety, teleworking, skills/training and the future of customer engagement. “While getting through the immediate phase of the pandemic is top of mind for businesses and government, it is critical to start to plan now for the return to the workplace. Planning now will mean employers and employees are better placed to accelerate a return to operations under the new normal, which puts us one step closer to economic recovery. The faster we get there, together, the better, and that’s why the decisions we make today matter,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. Health and Safety There are numerous considerations for employers to think through now to be able to react quickly, particularly the need to manage a workforce that may not be entirely vaccinated. Although vaccination and herd immunity will be the long-term solutions to the pandemic, a suite of complementary measures will need to be used by businesses to rebuild trust that the workplace is safe to return to. These include rapid screening, ventilation upgrades and monitoring, as well as masking and monitoring protocols. In order to do so successfully, the government must provide clarity on what employers can ask of their employees’ vaccination status, harmonize vaccine credential systems, provide clear guidance on workplace infection prevention and consistent criteria for safe re-opening of businesses. Telework The world of work has changed. Social distancing and health and safety protocols imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic forced firms to introduce telework on a large scale. Once the pandemic is over, many of these changes are anticipated to remain in the form of a hybrid work cycle for most businesses. There are several actions businesses can take to build a “new normal” workplace that aims to incorporate the positive aspects of teleworking and limits the risks, including synchronizing the physical and remote workplace, reframing the office as a hub for engagement and improving cybersecurity. To facilitate this shift, governments must improve Canada’s digital infrastructure, provide fiscal incentives to support remote work and establish national cybersecurity standards. Workforce Skills Developing enduring workforce skills and talent pipelines is critical to building the resilience of companies and workers in order to grow in the post-pandemic economy. Although this has always been important for businesses, it takes on an added importance given the pandemic has accelerated digital adoption, automation and other technologies. There are key actions companies should implement to improve workforce upskilling and reskilling, build a culture of lifelong learning and better utilize their existing workforce. Employers also need a closer alignment of business needs, the labour market and education programming to inform both education policy and appropriate fiscal incentives. Customer Experience Consumer spending habits changed drastically during the pandemic, resulting in a considerable increase in e-commerce and curbside pickup. Although many consumers will want to revert to in-person experiences, more activity is likely to structurally shift to remain online.

The next few months could also be unsurprising as a sharp rebound in employment is widely expected as these provincial economies begin to gradually reopen. Turning our attention to getting Canadians back to work will be a welcome reprieve. But let us be clear, the coming rebound in jobs is not a recovery in jobs. The rate of unemployment as a result of COVID is roughly 70% greater than that of the Great Recession where it took more than 10 years for the labour market to fully recover. It’s more than likely a labour market recovery from the pandemic could take years if not decades. We are nowhere near out of the woods. What’s different this time is the precipitous permanent closing of businesses. As the COVID-19 crisis continues, more employer–employee bonds break, amplifying the economic and societal damage. With more than 100,000 businesses now permanently closed, the ability to add new jobs is exponentially supressed. What we’re seeing right now is masking a devastating cumulative impact that will play out over the next decade. The number of long-term unemployed holds steady, with compounding impact on personal or household debt loads while they struggle with likely reduced income potential. Similarly, women who have left the workforce entirely because of domestic responsibilities will be adversely affected when, and indeed if, they choose to return to the workforce. They too will face lower income potential over the course of a lifetime and we are losing a generation of women who are potential board directors and c-suite leaders of the future. The economic scarring that will determine the nature and length of the gap between rebound and recovery is coming into focus, and its initial shape is K. There has, and will continue to be employment disruption and displacement as the k-shaped crisis continues. We need to get those on the bottom slope into sectors/jobs on the upward slope. In order to do that effectively, Canada needs more labour market assessments to figure out what the looming skills mismatch is and how we can best address it. The bottom line is: we won’t fix this long-term scarring with policies that made sense pre-COVID. Like so much of our lives and the world around us, our labour market is irreparably disrupted. We need a new plan that creates a much closer alignment between business needs, the labour market, and education and training. We’ll also need to look at the use of financial incentives to provide flexible learning options that meet market demand while allowing workers to re-skill or upskill. Some of us will be lucky enough to celebrate the rebound in jobs in the coming months but for far too many, the economic scars from COVID-19 will last a lifetime. They deserve a national strategy that recognizes their scars and gives them hope.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

We are very worried about a wave of business closures through 2022 as they face a tipping point of continued revenue loss and maximum indebtedness. The situation is untenable with the current one-size-fits-all approach to government support programs,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO, Canadian Chamber of Commerce. These travel, hospitality, and tourism industry sectors will remain unable to reach their full activity for many quarters. Several factors are converging to limit their recovery, including the likely uneven rollback of travel restrictions; public health regulations that limit capacity in venues; and the need to build customer confidence after a long campaign by governments to encourage Canadians to stay home and avoid large gatherings. The runway to recovery is much longer for businesses in these sectors that for others that no longer need government support. In the March 2021 the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, half of businesses in the hardest hit sectors reported they are unable to take on any more debt, compared to 34% of businesses from across all sectors. The most recent Canadian Survey on Business Conditions found that employers in the accommodation and food services sector were three times as likely to lay off staff over the next year due to depressed consumer demand. “It would be tragic to have businesses manage to survive up until now, only to have to close their doors just before they reach the goal line. It would also be a waste of the government supports they’ve received. Focusing on these few sectors that need continuing help is not only the right thing to do, but also smart policy to help millions of Canadians return to their jobs,” added Beatty. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce provided a 12-point plan to help policymakers tailor their supports for these sectors, including: The Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS) should be maintained at their current respective 75% and 65% maximum rates through to Fall 2021. CERS also needs to be expanded to work better for medium-sized businesses and for those with locations in high-cost-of-living areas. From September 2021 onwards, the CEWS and CERS programs should be retooled so they continue for the hardest hit sectors through to Spring 2022, while winding down for businesses in sectors that have recovered. Interest payments on all government-backed loans for businesses in the hardest hit sectors under the CEBA and HASCAP programs should be forgiven. Introduce a point of sale HST rebate for hospitality and entertainment activities for 2021-2023. Federal and provincial governments should make available free rapid test kits to consumer-facing businesses until they are no longer needed to protect public health. The federal government should lead in developing a national standard for provinces to implement health credentials that include vaccination status and test results, including what businesses can ask of their customers about vaccination status. The federal government should enhance the COVID-19 Alert App by ensuring all positive cases are loaded into the COVID Alert App by provincial and territorial governments, and private clinics.

The nature of work has changed significantly in the last 18 months however, and our workplaces need to adapt quickly. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce today released a 21-point plan to provide guidance for businesses and policy recommendations for governments on four key areas for the re-opening of the economy: health/safety, teleworking, skills/training and the future of customer engagement. “While getting through the immediate phase of the pandemic is top of mind for businesses and government, it is critical to start to plan now for the return to the workplace. Planning now will mean employers and employees are better placed to accelerate a return to operations under the new normal, which puts us one step closer to economic recovery. The faster we get there, together, the better, and that’s why the decisions we make today matter,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. Health and Safety There are numerous considerations for employers to think through now to be able to react quickly, particularly the need to manage a workforce that may not be entirely vaccinated. Although vaccination and herd immunity will be the long-term solutions to the pandemic, a suite of complementary measures will need to be used by businesses to rebuild trust that the workplace is safe to return to. These include rapid screening, ventilation upgrades and monitoring, as well as masking and monitoring protocols. In order to do so successfully, the government must provide clarity on what employers can ask of their employees’ vaccination status, harmonize vaccine credential systems, provide clear guidance on workplace infection prevention and consistent criteria for safe re-opening of businesses. Telework The world of work has changed. Social distancing and health and safety protocols imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic forced firms to introduce telework on a large scale. Once the pandemic is over, many of these changes are anticipated to remain in the form of a hybrid work cycle for most businesses. There are several actions businesses can take to build a “new normal” workplace that aims to incorporate the positive aspects of teleworking and limits the risks, including synchronizing the physical and remote workplace, reframing the office as a hub for engagement and improving cybersecurity. To facilitate this shift, governments must improve Canada’s digital infrastructure, provide fiscal incentives to support remote work and establish national cybersecurity standards. Workforce Skills Developing enduring workforce skills and talent pipelines is critical to building the resilience of companies and workers in order to grow in the post-pandemic economy. Although this has always been important for businesses, it takes on an added importance given the pandemic has accelerated digital adoption, automation and other technologies. There are key actions companies should implement to improve workforce upskilling and reskilling, build a culture of lifelong learning and better utilize their existing workforce. Employers also need a closer alignment of business needs, the labour market and education programming to inform both education policy and appropriate fiscal incentives. Customer Experience Consumer spending habits changed drastically during the pandemic, resulting in a considerable increase in e-commerce and curbside pickup. Although many consumers will want to revert to in-person experiences, more activity is likely to structurally shift to remain online. The pandemic has also not abated the increasing consumer desire to purchase products that have been responsibly sourced. Businesses should keep a close eye on emerging environment, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. Governments can help businesses make these transitions to the new digitized environment by updating Canada’s privacy rules to protect customer data.

The Government of Canada’s Expert Panel laid out a comprehensive and science-based plan for how to safely reopen borders. This includes the elimination of quarantine hotels and moving travel measures to be administered on the basis of a traveller’s vaccination instead of their nationality. A federal government multi-step plan to reopen the border on the basis of the Expert Panel report is long overdue. COVID-19 does not recognize a traveller’s citizenship, and maintaining differentiated rules for Canadian residents versus others will stunt our recovery from the pandemic. As the government knows a quarter of businesses have reported travel restrictions to be a barrier for their business. Today’s announcement will helpfully make it easier for Canadians who travel abroad for business purposes, but continues to prevent visitors who want to come to Canada. Canadian communities whose jobs and livelihoods rely on tourism and companies that need to bring staff into the country for critical business functions will continue to feel the impact of these excessive restrictions. The fact that it is easier for vaccinated Canadians to fly to Paris than it is to drive to Buffalo demonstrates how illogical the present policy is.

And time is of the essence. Recent data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions shows that 1 in 5 Canadian organizations experienced cybersecurity incidents in 2020. This includes 6.6% that experienced more cybersecurity incidents in 2020 compared to 2019. Further, 1 in 4 organizations reported that adopting technologies was “somewhat” or “extremely” challenging. Canadians are concerned too. According to the 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer, 65% of Canadians are worried about falling victim to a cyber-attack. This is the second highest worry, behind only a fear of job loss (75%). Cyber-attack is an even bigger worry than COVID (60%) and climate change (63%). This concern extends to business leaders as well: PwC Canada reports that 80% of Canadian CEOs say they are concerned about cybersecurity as a threat to growth. “Canada’s digital expansion has been accelerated by COVID at a pace unimaginable before the pandemic. There is a very significant opportunity to seize the moment of soaring global demand and solidify Canada’s position as a global cybersecurity leader. Canada’s diminished fiscal health means we simply cannot afford to miss this economic opportunity. Businesses are ready to do their part, but they need government to make it easier for them do get the job done,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. The OECD has also raised a red flag regarding Canada’s lagging science and technology progress. While the majority of the OECD is increasing R&D investment – being led by the United States, Japan, Germany and Korea – Canada is one of only a few countries where R&D investment in science and technology is “stagnant”. With orders of magnitude more investments being made by Canada’s competitors, we are now at risk of being left behind. “There are three key areas Canada must improve upon,” explained Ulrike Bahr-Gedalia, Senior Director, Digital Economy, Technology & Innovation Policy at the Canadian Chamber. “First, investment in innovation; second, workforce and talent pipeline expansion and diversification; and third, Canada’s global competitiveness. The remote work fuelled by COVID means Canada will be competing with every country in the world for these highly sought-after skills and technologies, and we need to be much better prepared for these challenges. The time to do this is now!” To help address these challenges, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is today launching the Cyber. Right. Now. campaign, a concerted effort, led by the Canadian Chamber and supported by a broad range of 28 leading tech organizations of all sizes from across Canada. Together they are set to raise awareness and propose solutions to government to empower Canada to lead the global cybersecurity future.

Leading the Global Cybersecurity Future In an increasingly interconnected and digital world, accelerated by the pandemic, cybersecurity is an ever more vital topic for Canadians, government, and businesses alike. Investment in cybersecurity is essential to boosting the productivity and efficiency of the Canadian economy. With privacy and data protection critical in our modern economy where Canadians are frequently accessing digital services, the risks are meanwhile at an all-time high. Canadians deserve strong protections to ensure their personal data is safe. Canadians should be proud that our country has a strong cybersecurity foundation in place, with a number of significant global companies calling Canada home. While the recently released 2021 federal budget did dedicate significant investments in cybersecurity to secure government IT infrastructure, it made no specific commitment to help Canadian businesses boost their cybersecurity measures. At the same time our most direct competitors in the U.S., Israel, and UK are investing billions. The OECD has also raised a red flag: while the majority of the OECD is increasing R&D investment – being led by the United States, Japan, Germany and Korea – Canada is one of only a few countries where R&D investment is “stagnant”. With far less investment in Canadian cybersecurity, Canada now finds itself at risk of being left behind. Small and mid-sized organizations in particular are in need of greater cybersecurity threat awareness, protection, and training to utilize the full suite of tools at their disposal to keep Canadians safe from bad actors. Cybersecurity expertise should be supported to provide the necessary protection and training. Cybersecurity is part of a vast digital ecosystem that connects communities across Canada and around the world. In 2018, Canada’s 340 cybersecurity companies contributed $2.3 billion to Canada’s GDP and 22,000 high-skilled, well-paying jobs. Continuing to sustain innovation and build trust in this digital world demands continued growth of cybersecurity capacity. Digital expansion, hastened by COVID-19, has created significant opportunity right now to create high-skilled, well-paying jobs, increase exports, and contribute to Canada’s economic recovery. This moment might never come again. Canada is well-positioned on cybersecurity, but our global competitors are moving fast.

Leading the Global Cybersecurity Future In an increasingly interconnected and digital world, accelerated by the pandemic, cybersecurity is an ever more vital topic for Canadians, government, and businesses alike. Investment in cybersecurity is essential to boosting the productivity and efficiency of the Canadian economy. With privacy and data protection critical in our modern economy where Canadians are frequently accessing digital services, the risks are meanwhile at an all-time high. Canadians deserve strong protections to ensure their personal data is safe. Canadians should be proud that our country has a strong cybersecurity foundation in place, with a number of significant global companies calling Canada home. While the recently released 2021 federal budget did dedicate significant investments in cybersecurity to secure government IT infrastructure, it made no specific commitment to help Canadian businesses boost their cybersecurity measures. At the same time our most direct competitors in the U.S., Israel, and UK are investing billions. The OECD has also raised a red flag: while the majority of the OECD is increasing R&D investment – being led by the United States, Japan, Germany and Korea – Canada is one of only a few countries where R&D investment is “stagnant”. With far less investment in Canadian cybersecurity, Canada now finds itself at risk of being left behind. Small and mid-sized organizations in particular are in need of greater cybersecurity threat awareness, protection, and training to utilize the full suite of tools at their disposal to keep Canadians safe from bad actors. Cybersecurity expertise should be supported to provide the necessary protection and training. Cybersecurity is part of a vast digital ecosystem that connects communities across Canada and around the world. In 2018, Canada’s 340 cybersecurity companies contributed $2.3 billion to Canada’s GDP and 22,000 high-skilled, well-paying jobs. Continuing to sustain innovation and build trust in this digital world demands continued growth of cybersecurity capacity. Digital expansion, hastened by COVID-19, has created significant opportunity right now to create high-skilled, well-paying jobs, increase exports, and contribute to Canada’s economic recovery. This moment might never come again. Canada is well-positioned on cybersecurity, but our global competitors are moving fast.

And time is of the essence. Recent data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions shows that 1 in 5 Canadian organizations experienced cybersecurity incidents in 2020. This includes 6.6% that experienced more cybersecurity incidents in 2020 compared to 2019. Further, 1 in 4 organizations reported that adopting technologies was “somewhat” or “extremely” challenging. Canadians are concerned too. According to the 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer, 65% of Canadians are worried about falling victim to a cyber-attack. This is the second highest worry, behind only a fear of job loss (75%). Cyber-attack is an even bigger worry than COVID (60%) and climate change (63%). This concern extends to business leaders as well: PwC Canada reports that 80% of Canadian CEOs say they are concerned about cybersecurity as a threat to growth. “Canada’s digital expansion has been accelerated by COVID at a pace unimaginable before the pandemic. There is a very significant opportunity to seize the moment of soaring global demand and solidify Canada’s position as a global cybersecurity leader. Canada’s diminished fiscal health means we simply cannot afford to miss this economic opportunity. Businesses are ready to do their part, but they need government to make it easier for them do get the job done,” said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. The OECD has also raised a red flag regarding Canada’s lagging science and technology progress. While the majority of the OECD is increasing R&D investment – being led by the United States, Japan, Germany and Korea – Canada is one of only a few countries where R&D investment in science and technology is “stagnant”. With orders of magnitude more investments being made by Canada’s competitors, we are now at risk of being left behind. “There are three key areas Canada must improve upon,” explained Ulrike Bahr-Gedalia, Senior Director, Digital Economy, Technology & Innovation Policy at the Canadian Chamber. “First, investment in innovation; second, workforce and talent pipeline expansion and diversification; and third, Canada’s global competitiveness. The remote work fuelled by COVID means Canada will be competing with every country in the world for these highly sought-after skills and technologies, and we need to be much better prepared for these challenges. The time to do this is now!” To help address these challenges, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is today launching the Cyber. Right. Now. campaign, a concerted effort, led by the Canadian Chamber and supported by a broad range of 28 leading tech organizations of all sizes from across Canada. Together they are set to raise awareness and propose solutions to government to empower Canada to lead the global cybersecurity future.

To deliver on this mission, we are committed to inclusive growth and enhancing support for members to fill their talent and skills gaps, and in doing so, increase opportunities for underrepresented segments of the Canadian population to participate fully in the economy and ensuring an inclusive recovery. Our prosperity depends on a strong business community that is able to innovate, attract talent and capital and expand into new markets. Ensuring all Canadians—from all sectors, regions and backgrounds— have the opportunity to participate in, and rise up through, the workforce is one way to address this issue. During the recovery from COVID-19, this is truer than ever. Diversity and inclusion in the workplace fosters creative thinking, innovation and problem solving, providing organizations—and the country—a competitive advantage. Research shows the most successful organizations are creating diversified and inclusive workplaces in which individual differences and the contributions of all employees are recognized and valued. Inclusion also makes financial sense. Improved participation rates could add 2.2 million workers to the labour force by 2040, including more women, Indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities. Not to mention grow our economy by $101 billion. Our inclusive growth work builds on our efforts in the area of fostering diverse and inclusive workplaces and will support businesses looking to fill their talent and skills gaps, expanding their workforce base. In doing so, we will enhance opportunities for underrepresented segments of the Canadian population to participate in the economy and foster stronger communities across the country, resulting in a more prosperous Canada that benefits all Canadians. Council for Women’s Advocacy The Council for Women’s Advocacy (CWA) is a cornerstone of the Canadian Chamber’s inclusive growth and recovery efforts. It has been established in order to bring the voice and perspectives of women to national policies, inform the Canadian Chamber’s initiatives in advancing the gender equality agenda, and drive meaningful action to address the identified issues and barriers. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, CWA members agreed to focus on recommendations for a gender-inclusive recovery. Right now, women everywhere in Canada are facing many pandemic-related unknowns about their working lives. How do they keep working if their child is home from school amid an outbreak? How do they afford childcare when many jobs are in a precarious state? For those who are business owners, how do they keep their businesses open? Ensuring women have opportunities to fully participate in the recovery is essential for widespread job creation and sustained economic growth. Canada is entering a period of cautious recovery and employment may not return to pre-crisis levels at any point soon. Available jobs and the skills required will shift. Employers might increasingly look to automation to maintain operations during future crises and reduce risk. Canadians will need reskilling, upskilling and skills training programs to get them back to work. Education and training will also change, including a greater need for online learning and durable skills, with a focus on both work-integrated and lifelong learning. A new normal based on the realities of a potential second wave and long-term impacts to businesses, communities and every aspect of the economy must be considered. Success will not happen in a vacuum; there must be strong efforts and supports from all levels of government and various stakeholders, including male leadership and colleagues. There will be no inclusive recovery – or recovery period – without the participation of women in the workforce. Ensuring women have opportunities to fully participate in the recovery is essential for widespread job creation and sustained economic growth.

Mental Health Awareness Mental health is health. Even at the best of times, mental health is an issue worthy of more attention. Now more than ever, with COVID-19 placing a significant amount of pressure on employees, employers and families, promoting good mental health is crucial to achieving inclusive economic growth. As businesses and organizations across the country adjust to new realities during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to take small breaks during the day to support mental health and well-being. That’s why we have partnered with Workplace Strategies for Mental Health, compliments of Canada Life, to send 270 Break Boxes to businesses and their employees across Canada. These practical resource kits were designed to help support positive mental health at work and at home through a variety of individual and team-based activities. Break Box is a tangible reminder to take a break and focus on your mental health. Taking breaks can help improve things like decision-making, creativity, focus and information retention. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is also pleased to raise awareness of WellCan by Morneau Shepell. The WellCan app is a free collection of digital resources to support the mental health of all Canadians during COVID-19. Canadians with Disabilities More than six million Canadians have a disability of some form, which represents about 17% of the Canadian population. To build a strong economy, particularly as Canada works to recover from COVID-19, these Canadians must be included. Improving accessibility is foundational to fostering inclusive growth. For our part, in 2018 the new Ottawa headquarters for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce received the Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification. The Chamber has a responsibility to lead the way in improving accessibility to the places where we work. We believe in the bottom line benefits of accessibility, diversity and inclusion, and we walk the talk. The certification program measures the level of meaningful access beyond building code, and is based upon the holistic user experience of people with varying disabilities affecting their mobility, vision, and hearing. It also provides a roadmap for the adoption of meaningful access and universal design principles and a way for all levels of governments to work together to improve the built environment. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is additionally a partner of the Canadian Accessibility Network, established by Carleton University to advance accessibility for persons with disabilities though research, design, education, policy, employment, and community engagement. Together we can build a more accessible, inclusive Canada, for the benefit of all Canadians.

Canadian Chamber of Commerce (OTTAWA) – July 9, 2021 – The Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s Senior Director of Tax and Financial Policy, Patrick Gill, issued the following statement regarding the government’s decision to stall the implementation of Bill C-208. “Parliament has spoken and made its desire clear to make the sale of a small business to family members as easy as a sale to an unrelated buyer. Bill C-208 addressed this discriminatory tax policy, only to see the new legislation’s implementation blocked. The decision to shelve the legislation of Bill C-208 is highly unusual and the government should reverse this decision immediately. Small family businesses are not asking for special treatment, they are asking for the same treatment as everyone else. The shelving of Bill C-208 will effectively discriminate against small family businesses by taxing them at higher rates than if they sold to a complete stranger. This unfair tax treatment is hindering many companies from selling or transferring their business to another family member. According to Statistics Canada, of the businesses planning to sell or transfer their operations in the next year, only 10% plan to sell to family members compared to 73% which plan to sell to external parties. This legislation would make it easier for succession planning, but it has now become stuck in a legislative limbo that makes it impossible for small business owners to effectively plan. This issue is so critical to Canadian small businesses that 97% of nearly 450 local chambers of commerce voted to make it a major policy focus. This uncertainty creates an unnecessary layer of confusion and complexity for small businesses after what has been a very difficult and challenging year. Small family-run businesses need clarity, support, and less regulatory burden. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce calls upon the government to immediately allow the legislation of Bill C-208 to come into effect.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country.

In contrast with its commitment, the U.S. decision is uncoordinated with Canada’s announcement on Monday of a border reopening, and it flies in the face of both science and the most recent public health data. It’s hard to see how allowing fully vaccinated Canadians to enter the U.S. poses a public health threat when travel within the U.S. is unrestricted. Vaccination rates in Canada are higher than in the U.S. and infection rates are dramatically lower. Additionally, the U.S. policy applies very different standards to travelers crossing at a land border than those who fly. “Canada’s government must press the U.S. administration to reverse its policy.

To deliver on this mission, we are committed to inclusive growth and enhancing support for members to fill their talent and skills gaps, and in doing so, increase opportunities for underrepresented segments of the Canadian population to participate fully in the economy and ensuring an inclusive recovery. Our prosperity depends on a strong business community that is able to innovate, attract talent and capital and expand into new markets. Ensuring all Canadians—from all sectors, regions and backgrounds— have the opportunity to participate in, and rise up through, the workforce is one way to address this issue. During the recovery from COVID-19, this is truer than ever. Diversity and inclusion in the workplace fosters creative thinking, innovation and problem solving, providing organizations—and the country—a competitive advantage. Research shows the most successful organizations are creating diversified and inclusive workplaces in which individual differences and the contributions of all employees are recognized and valued. Inclusion also makes financial sense. Improved participation rates could add 2.2 million workers to the labour force by 2040, including more women, Indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities. Not to mention grow our economy by $101 billion. Our inclusive growth work builds on our efforts in the area of fostering diverse and inclusive workplaces and will support businesses looking to fill their talent and skills gaps, expanding their workforce base. In doing so, we will enhance opportunities for underrepresented segments of the Canadian population to participate in the economy and foster stronger communities across the country, resulting in a more prosperous Canada that benefits all Canadians. Council for Women’s Advocacy The Council for Women’s Advocacy (CWA) is a cornerstone of the Canadian Chamber’s inclusive growth and recovery efforts. It has been established in order to bring the voice and perspectives of women to national policies, inform the Canadian Chamber’s initiatives in advancing the gender equality agenda, and drive meaningful action to address the identified issues and barriers. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, CWA members agreed to focus on recommendations for a gender-inclusive recovery. Right now, women everywhere in Canada are facing many pandemic-related unknowns about their working lives. How do they keep working if their child is home from school amid an outbreak? How do they afford childcare when many jobs are in a precarious state? For those who are business owners, how do they keep their businesses open? Ensuring women have opportunities to fully participate in the recovery is essential for widespread job creation and sustained economic growth. Canada is entering a period of cautious recovery and employment may not return to pre-crisis levels at any point soon. Available jobs and the skills required will shift. Employers might increasingly look to automation to maintain operations during future crises and reduce risk. Canadians will need reskilling, upskilling and skills training programs to get them back to work. Education and training will also change, including a greater need for online learning and durable skills, with a focus on both work-integrated and lifelong learning. A new normal based on the realities of a potential second wave and long-term impacts to businesses, communities and every aspect of the economy must be considered. Success will not happen in a vacuum; there must be strong efforts and supports from all levels of government and various stakeholders, including male leadership and colleagues. There will be no inclusive recovery – or recovery period – without the participation of women in the workforce. Ensuring women have opportunities to fully participate in the recovery is essential for widespread job creation and sustained economic growth.

Mental Health Awareness Mental health is health. Even at the best of times, mental health is an issue worthy of more attention. Now more than ever, with COVID-19 placing a significant amount of pressure on employees, employers and families, promoting good mental health is crucial to achieving inclusive economic growth. As businesses and organizations across the country adjust to new realities during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to take small breaks during the day to support mental health and well-being. That’s why we have partnered with Workplace Strategies for Mental Health, compliments of Canada Life, to send 270 Break Boxes to businesses and their employees across Canada. These practical resource kits were designed to help support positive mental health at work and at home through a variety of individual and team-based activities. Break Box is a tangible reminder to take a break and focus on your mental health. Taking breaks can help improve things like decision-making, creativity, focus and information retention. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is also pleased to raise awareness of WellCan by Morneau Shepell. The WellCan app is a free collection of digital resources to support the mental health of all Canadians during COVID-19. Canadians with Disabilities More than six million Canadians have a disability of some form, which represents about 17% of the Canadian population. To build a strong economy, particularly as Canada works to recover from COVID-19, these Canadians must be included. Improving accessibility is foundational to fostering inclusive growth. For our part, in 2018 the new Ottawa headquarters for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce received the Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification. The Chamber has a responsibility to lead the way in improving accessibility to the places where we work. We believe in the bottom line benefits of accessibility, diversity and inclusion, and we walk the talk. The certification program measures the level of meaningful access beyond building code, and is based upon the holistic user experience of people with varying disabilities affecting their mobility, vision, and hearing. It also provides a roadmap for the adoption of meaningful access and universal design principles and a way for all levels of governments to work together to improve the built environment. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is additionally a partner of the Canadian Accessibility Network, established by Carleton University to advance accessibility for persons with disabilities though research, design, education, policy, employment, and community engagement. Together we can build a more accessible, inclusive Canada, for the benefit of all Canadians.

In contrast with its commitment, the U.S. decision is uncoordinated with Canada’s announcement on Monday of a border reopening, and it flies in the face of both science and the most recent public health data. It’s hard to see how allowing fully vaccinated Canadians to enter the U.S. poses a public health threat when travel within the U.S. is unrestricted. Vaccination rates in Canada are higher than in the U.S. and infection rates are dramatically lower. Additionally, the U.S. policy applies very different standards to travelers crossing at a land border than those who fly. “Canada’s government must press the U.S. administration to reverse its policy.

Small businesses make up 98% of all companies in Canada. We commend the government of Canada and Parliamentarians from across party lines, including MPs Larry Maguire and Wayne Easter, for not only seeing that C-208 passed through Parliament, but also addressing the issue as soon as possible. As we make our way from economic recovery to growth, it will be important for small businesses to know that they are being supported. Today’s announcement removes the legislative limbo facing small businesses, which will help facilitate succession planning and help contribute to the successful longevity of Canadian companies.

Governments across the country need to recognize that we have already begun a fourth wave and must act urgently to avoid more across-the-board lockdowns. Canada needs a new approach, and we need better leadership from our elected officials. More than 17 months into the pandemic, we now have significantly better tools to help us protect Canadians while avoiding the damaging lockdowns imposed in previous waves. However, these tools will only work if they are used, and too many governments are dragging their feet. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is asking governments to urgently undertake four actions within our grasp to avoid future lockdowns: 1. Digital vaccination certificates – Paper vaccination certificates are unsecure and inefficient. Provide the tools so businesses of all sizes, in every part of Canada, can use digital health credentials to protect employees and customers and mandate their use in clearly defined essential circumstances. Federal and provincial governments must also accelerate efforts to provide global vaccine credentials and secure the rights of fully vaccinated Canadians to travel. 2. Business operations and vaccination status disclosure – Businesses have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees and customers, but the current confused regulations stand in their way. We need governments to immediately provide labour law and Charter clarity on what business operators can require of employees and customers regarding vaccination status. Governments should lead by example and ensure public-facing officials are vaccinated. They must enable employers to require vaccinations for positions where it is necessary to protect their workforces and their customers. 3. Rapid testing – Make available, and encourage the use of, rapid testing as part of a multi-layered approach to protect employees and customers. In instances where people may not be able to be vaccinated for medical or religious reasons, rapid screening may provide a workable alternative. 4. Vaccine uptake – Promote vaccination across Canada with incentives, including secure vaccination credentials and relaxed travel rules for fully vaccinated travellers. Businesses, Canadians and governments have all worked hard to bring us close to the finish line. Another lockdown will be the final nail in the coffin for thousands of small businesses, especially in the hardest-hit sectors. We must make use of every option we have to protect these businesses and the Canadians they employ. Waiting to act until it is too late will cost lives, freedoms and businesses.” About the Canadian Chamber of Commerce – Because Business Matters The Canadian Chamber of Commerce helps build the businesses that support our families, our communities and our country. We do this by influencing government policy, by providing essential business services and by connecting businesses to information they can use, to opportunities for growth and to a network of local chambers, businesses, decision-makers and peers from across the country, in every sector of the economy and at all levels of government, as well as internationally.

While they can expect many spending announcements, lofty promises of jobs and boutique tax cuts during this election, what they’re looking for has been missing so far. Conspicuously absent in the election to date is a serious, sustainable and bold plan to grow our economy, despite the fact the economy is the number one concern for Canadians. The need for strong, sustained economic growth is now beyond debate. Canada’s credit cards have been maxed with pandemic debt, and the cost of dealing with climate change and confronting other urgent issues will only increase for everyday Canadians and businesses. A serious, bold strategy to grow our economy is Canada’s only way forward, and Canadians have the right to know where the parties stand before they go to the polls. We have outlined our recommendations for what it takes to grow an economy and challenge all parties to adopt them. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is Canada’s largest business association representing 450 local chambers of commerce and boards of trade, accounting for more than 200,000 member businesses from every Main Street in the country. These recommendations reflect the economic realities of Canada’s job creators and growth generators. A message from our President & CEO After over a year-and-a-half of lockdowns and sacrifice, Canadians are seeing the benefits of their efforts to stop COVID-19. The pandemic is not over, but we can now look beyond COVID to plan for our future. As we do, each Canadian must ask these important questions during this election about the priorities for the next Parliament. How can we put the economic damage of COVID behind us? How can we overcome Canada’s longstanding economic challenges? And how do we create 21st century opportunities for Canadians? In other words, are the parties proposing to do what it will take to grow the Canadian economy? The choices in this election are critical. When the campaign buses have been parked for the final time and all the speeches have been made, our decision will not only determine how quickly we can resume more normal lives, but also whether future generations will enjoy more opportunities. Reaching this point in the fight against COVID came at an enormous cost in lives, in time with our families and friends, and in the thousands of businesses that have closed permanently. But the fact that we can now plan for the future is also the result of Canadians’ willingness to do what was needed, from wearing protective equipment and physically distancing to getting vaccinated at record levels. Canada’s business community also did its part. Factories and workshops retooled to provide critically-needed equipment and supplies, restaurants and retail stores reinvented business models to serve their customers in completely new ways, we introduced new processes and equipment to protect staff and customers and we collaborated with government and public health authorities to promote vaccinations. Having joined forces to overcome the deadly threat of COVID, we all must now work together to repair the damage it has inflicted on our economy. The pandemic saddled governments and businesses with a debt burden that would have been unimaginable just two years ago. The government projects that Canada’s national debt will rise to $1.4 trillion over the next five years. In addition, while economic activity has still not recovered in many sectors, countless Canadian companies — particularly our small businesses — have acquired a debt load that still threatens their very survival. They will require continued assistance to recover. Canada’s next Parliament must also fix longstanding fundamental problems that hold us back. We cannot borrow our way to prosperity. Nor should we confuse government spending with actual economic growth. Above all, we must not try to go back to where we were before COVID when Canada lagged its competitors in investment and growth. Compared with other leading economies, Canada’s pre-COVID economic performance was weak and getting weaker. Canada’s international competitors are working to improve their performance and create good jobs for their citizens. To succeed in the face of fierce competition, Canada must generate sustained business investment, jobs and growth here — not just in the short term, but for many years. All of our other goals for Canadian society depend on our ability to sustain a growing economy. Canadians must collectively decide which party offers a plan that has what it takes to grow: Finishing the fight against COVID. Getting the fundamentals right. Creating 21st century opportunities. While the Canadian Chamber of Commerce will remain strictly non-partisan throughout the election, this document provides a perspective from the Canadian business community on how we can build a brighter future for all Canadians. I hope it will help you as you consider the important choices ahead. Hon. Perrin Beatty President and CEO Canadian Chamber of Commerce Finishing the fight against COVID Getting the fundamentals right Creating 21st century opportunities JOB ONE: Finishing the fight against COVID The sacrifices each of us has made have brought us a long way in our efforts to beat the pandemic. Now that the hope of more normal lives is finally in sight, we need to make sure everyone makes it safely to the shore. Offering an extra hand for the hardest-hit Many small enterprises and businesses in the hardest-hit sectors, including tourism, travel and hospitality, will not recover until public health restrictions are lifted and economic activity returns to normal. Until that time comes, these fellow Canadians require ongoing support. To help the hardest-hit return to growth: Create a replacement program for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS). This should be exclusively available for businesses that are still hurt by pandemic-related public health restrictions. This program should cover the period from October 2021 until spring 2022. The revamped version must retain at least the 75% (CEWS) and 65% (CERS) subsidy rates, in line with what businesses in other sectors had access to until they were permitted to recover. Introduce debt relief by forgiving interest payments on COVID-related government backed loans for SMEs in the hardest-hit sectors. This measure should apply to the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA), the Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP) and the Highly Affected Sectors Credit Availability Program (HASCAP). Making every dollar count Sustained growth requires private sector investment to replace the government stimulus measures designed for crisis management. Over the past year, Canadians, businesses and our governments have added debt to help manage through the crisis. These difficult decisions were necessary to protect our resources and livelihoods. Borrowing capacity is significantly more limited today. To protect our government finances and sustain public services, we need to get maximum mileage for every dollar spent. It is essential to restore a solid fiscal anchor. To protect Canada’s finances: Return to pre-pandemic deficit-to-GDP ratio levels within five years. Ensure GDP growth exceeds pre-pandemic levels by a substantial margin and public spending is focused on generating economic growth. JOB TWO: Getting the fundamentals right As Canada emerges from COVID, we must not mistake spending for economic growth. Even before COVID, Canada spent significantly but lagged in economic growth, in attracting investment and in creating good jobs for Canadians. COVID-era recovery programs, while important, were not designed to address the fundamental problems plaguing Canada on infrastructure investment, regulatory burdens, taxation, SME competitiveness and internal trade barriers. Canada must get its house in order to fuel real growth that creates jobs for its citizens. Supporting our SMEs Canadians are hardworking and innovative, so it is no surprise SMEs are Canada’s biggest employers. The next Parliament must ensure an environment that helps Canada’s entrepreneurs grow and create jobs. To support Canadian entrepreneurship: Increase the revenue threshold for GST/HST registration. Increasing the threshold will support small business creation and promote the commercialization of existing Canadian innovation. Modernize the tax system so it works for SMEs. Form a Government of Canada Tax Working Group to further simplify Canada’s tax system, particularly for small businesses. Develop a Small Business Net-Zero Strategy. This strategy will provide Main Street SMEs with incentives and opportunities to participate in Canada’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions. Continue facilitating the secure digitalization of SMEs. The government can enhance growth by making cybersecurity part of the recently launched Canada Digital Adoption Program and by championing the development of cybersecurity standards across the country. Building our infrastructure Businesses will only reach new customers if they can get their products to market. Getting there requires high-quality infrastructure with sufficient capacity to carry goods across different modes of transportation. To build Canada’s growth-supporting infrastructure: Finance the National Trade Corridors Fund with $5 billion per year in total. This measure will enable more provinces, territories and municipalities to receive infrastructure funding to move goods domestically and abroad. Growing our workforce If business drives job creation and growth, people are the engine. To create sustained growth, Canadian businesses need the capital and capacity to fill labour needs. To enable Canada to prosper once again, government policies must support the conditions for businesses to be inclusive, invest and grow. Growth must be inclusive To achieve economic growth, we must include all Canadians, including those who have been left behind until now. Our shared prosperity depends on a strong business community that can innovate, attract talent and capital and expand into new markets. To create inclusive growth, Canadians from all sectors, regions and backgrounds must be able to participate in the workforce and share in the benefits. To achieve inclusive growth: Speed up the Indigenous reconciliation process. Accelerate land claims settlements and implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action 92. Create new opportunities for diversity-owned business and those with diverse workforces to access federal contracts. Provide enhanced opportunities for diversity-owned businesses to secure public procurement contracts, including metrics and resources targeted at supporting access for women-owned and other diversity-owned businesses and those diversifying their workforces. Remove tax barriers for childcare expenses. Make childcare an eligible business expense for SMEs, remove the requirement for the lower-income spouse to receive the childcare deduction and permit SME owners receiving non-eligible dividend income to claim childcare expenses against that income. Getting Canadians working Particularly given its aging population, Canada needs its workforce to generate economic activity as productively as possible. To build an inclusive, productive workforce: Build closer collaboration among governments, employers and educational institutions. To succeed in the 21st century economy, Canada needs a 21st century workforce, which it can only achieve through better communication and collaboration among the key players. Mandate Statistics Canada to collect comprehensive forward-looking data on labour market needs. This information will inform education (including upskilling and reskilling) policy and improve the navigation of existing education programs and immigration policies. Modernize the Temporary Foreign Worker program. Implement a Trusted Employers Program that includes both an appeals process and better alignment with regions facing chronic labour shortages. Create flexible, accessible, navigable upskilling and reskilling options. Developing a culture of lifelong learning can create talent pipelines through targeted matchmaking programs. This approach will help build resilient employees and businesses alike, reduce risks for all groups and create a more diverse workforce. Realizing the full potential of #TeamCanada Over the past year, Canadians have rallied together as part of #TeamCanada to retool manufacturing, modify supply chains, support remote work and keep each other safe. Now, to grow we need to finally make Canada’s economy truly national. We must end the regulatory patchwork and interprovincial trade barriers that separate Canadians. To reach Canada’s potential: Ensure the Canada Free Trade Agreement covers all sectors of the economy. The agreement’s value is greatly diminished by proliferating exceptions. Require all regulators to assess economic and business impacts in the regulatory process. Understanding the impact of regulations on business is critical to a competitive regulatory process. Modernizing our tax system Canadians need a modern tax system that encourages business investment. Only by using all the tools in our toolbox — including the tax system — will we sustain long-term growth. To have a tax system that meets the challenges of the 21st century: Commit to not introduce new uncompetitive taxes on businesses. New taxes will prevent companies from making job-creating investments. Undertake a comprehensive and independent tax system review. The results will ensure our country remains globally competitive and attractive for investment given the upcoming global tax regime changes being discussed at the OECD. Create an Investment Tax Credit. By responding to the current U.S. competitive advantage on tax credits and deductions for capital investments, we can mobilize private capital, spur investment and create growth. Establish Economic Opportunity Zones in Canada. The U.S. Treasury Department estimates that by deferring, reducing or waiving capital gains taxes on investments in more than 8,700 targeted geographic areas, Opportunity Zones will mobilize $100 billion (USD) in private investment to create jobs and economic development. If Canada adopts a similar system, we can mobilize private capital for economic growth here. JOB THREE: Creating 21st century opportunities The Canadian brand is strong. We are seen as ethical and rules-based. We are blessed with world-class cities, abundant natural resources and talented, entrepreneurial people. While our country and people have all the ingredients for success, our global competitors are working hard to attract investment that can create the next generation of opportunities elsewhere. Canada must ensure the types of jobs and opportunities people want are being created here. Digitizing our world In a digital world, Canadians are connected like never before. Our educated workforce and advanced digital infrastructure give Canada a strong starting point to be a leader in the global digital future, but our competitors are on the move. Safely connecting Canadians and the world As virtual activities increase, businesses and their customers must be confident that their data is protected. We also must help companies innovate to meet the digital needs of the world. In parallel, Canada needs to ensure it has the talent and skills in place to prepare Canadians through ongoing upskilling and reskilling. To better support Canada’s digital ecosystem: Re-introduce privacy reform legislation in the next Parliament. This legislation will set a single national standard for privacy protection, preventing a patchwork of provincial rules. Expand investments in broadband through the Universal Broadband Fund. Enabling more access to 5G internet in rural and remote communities will support job creation outside urban centres. Step up investments in cybersecurity. Enabling businesses to write off cybersecurity-related investments will encourage investment and improve security. This measure should include software, education, training, certification and equipment in the same year those investments are made. Protecting our environment There is perhaps no greater challenge facing Canadians than protecting our environment for both current and future generations. Equally, the opportunity to realize net-zero has never been greater. By bringing together innovative technologies, common interests and intent, and world-leading standards, Canadian businesses can demonstrate to the world environmental stewardship, economic growth and attracting investment can go hand-in-hand. Achieving our net-zero future We must ensure Canada’s pathway to net-zero allows our businesses to compete successfully, enhances investment, creates jobs for Canadians, promotes innovation and genuinely benefits the environment. How we get there matters. Canada’s business community wants to collaborate with government to develop solutions to our country’s greatest environmental challenges and enable economic opportunities for Canadians. To achieve net-zero emissions and ensure the viability of Canadian businesses: Implement a strategy for low carbon exports. A well-considered strategy will enable businesses to reach new customers who want goods that are less energy intensive. Develop common standards for sustainable finance. These shared standards can ensure Canadian energy companies are recognized for their work to decarbonize their operations and support attracting investment into the Canadian energy sector. Allow carbon offsets purchased in foreign markets to be used to meet Canadian requirements. By working with our trading partners, we will give our companies more tools to meet emissions targets. Canadian agriculture is part of the solution Canadian agriculture and agri-food leads the world in the fight against climate change, and we have an opportunity to be a global leader in food production. From producers to processors, to manufacturers and everywhere in between, each is doing its part to feed the world sustainably. With targeted investment programs and smart regulation, Canada can serve as a model to the world in reaching a net-zero future by unleashing the sector’s potential. To champion Canadian agriculture: Position Canadian agriculture as a global leader in the fight against climate change. By championing Canadian best practices, such as the 4R program, carbon smart farming and nutrient efficiency, we can cut global emissions. Canadian agriculture contributes about 8% to domestic greenhouse gas emissions, compared to the global average of 23%. Pursue balanced economic and environmental objectives. By fulfilling the export-based and economic objectives set out in the Barton Report on Economic Growth, combined with strategic investments in rural broadband and carbon-capture technologies, we can help the agriculture and agri-food sector reach its full potential and support Canadian job creation. Championing our place in the world With trade agreements in place with many of the world’s largest economies, Canadian businesses are in an enviable position to win new customers. The door to world markets has been opened. Now we need to help Canadian businesses get through it. Selling to the world Ensuring Canadian interests are reflected in international trade rules will allow businesses to compete on a level playing field to support growth and create jobs. To expand Canada’s market reach: Renew the Canada-U.S. relationship. Focusing on areas of alignment to ensure Canada is a valued ally, including critical mineral supply chains, a strengthened shared defence industrial base, a renewed and reinvigorated Regulatory Cooperation Council and joint action on climate change in the transition to a lower carbon economy. Increase agricultural exports. Enhancing the ability of agriculture exporters to take advantage of trade agreements will increase the number of potential customers. Focus our multilateral trade efforts on key issues. Resolving the major issues affecting Canadian companies will increase our ability to compete. These issues include digital trade, trade facilitation and trade-distorting industrial subsidies. Fighting for Canadian natural resources The resource sector remains a fundamental driver of Canada’s economic growth. In the first quarter of 2019 alone, the resource sector added $236 billion to Canada’s GDP. Our ability to succeed in a post-COVID world will be shaped by the fortunes of our resource sector. With forward-looking government policies, Canada can unlock growth and meet its climate targets. To allow Canada to sustainably supply the resources of the future: Develop energy and trade corridors to support resource exports. By supporting our natural resource exports and infrastructure development, Canada can better decarbonize industrial activity and our power grids. Additionally, implementing energy and trade corridors as designated sites will help create a simpler and more predictable regulatory process. Improve the regulatory environment to attract capital. By attracting investment capital, Canada will create new energy assets, including a hydrogen industry, and decarbonize current energy-intensive industries. The regulatory improvements include weighing Canadian exports as part of global emissions reductions, ensuring climate risks in financial markets are aligned with the U.S. and creating policy certainty. Execute a critical minerals strategy. This strategy will help build extraction, value-added processing and end-use manufacturing in Canada. Working in close collaboration with allies, Canada will reduce its reliance on unstable markets to ensure consumers have reliable access to vital products, such as battery technology and hi-tech goods, as well as for its national defence. Better protecting Canadians and creating resilient health infrastructure The pandemic has shown the health of Canadians and of our economy are closely linked. Canada must end its inability to make vaccines and other life-saving medicines. We face the dual challenge of an aging population and a weak biomanufacturing capacity to produce vaccines and life-saving drugs domestically. Improving our country’s ability to host vaccine and medical technology supply chains is crucial to Canadians’ health and economic security. It will also improve Canada’s ability to help others around the world. Additionally, we need to modernize how we procure for our healthcare industry to protect the health of Canadians more effectively. To create resilient health infrastructure: Implement a national life sciences strategy. The strategy must execute specific measures that will attract investments from life sciences companies into Canada for domestic production, develop life sciences R&D infrastructure, improve the system of patient access, invest in life sciences talent and ensure Canada is part of global supply chains. Create a strategy for value-based healthcare in Canada. This approach will foster innovation and a more holistic view of healthcare, including better measures to prevent high-cost illnesses by evaluating patient outcomes as part of the procurement process. The strategy should also help provincial and territorial governments implement trials with outcome-based delivery models within their jurisdictions.

Time to get serious about economic growth: Canadian Chamber of Commerce Canadian Chamber of Commerce (OTTAWA) – September 21, 2021 – The Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s President and CEO, Perrin Beatty, issued the following statement today on the actions that Canadians and the business community need to see from our next Parliament. “The clear message from last night’s election is that our politicians need to get back to work on the issues that matter. With an election that lacked a meaningful debate on the economy, it is critical for Parliament and the government to resume the business of governing the country. Canadians want less politics and more leadership from their elected officials. Businesses and the millions of Canadians they employ need action on two critical issues: safely managing the fourth wave of the pandemic without further lockdowns and implementing a strategy to restore economic growth to address our urgent and growing fiscal challenges. The recovery must be led by the private sector. We cannot borrow our way to prosperity, and we cannot confuse government spending with economic growth. We need to get very serious about growth if we are to have any hope of paying for our enormous pandemic debt and dealing with the coming costs of climate change. Parliament should be convened at the earliest possible opportunity with a Speech from the Throne that clearly outlines how we will finish the fight against COVID-19, address the economic fundamentals holding back our economy, and get our country ready for the opportunities of the future. With public finances stretched to the maximum, it is critical we target our investments to achieve private sector-led growth. Growing businesses that hire more Canadians is the only path towards true recovery and sustainable economic growth. The next Parliament needs to prioritize helping businesses of all sizes do exactly that, and they can start by focusing on: extending the wage and rent subsidy programs past to ensure support for the hardest hit sectors; accelerating the deployment of a harmonized system of digital health credentials and providing legal certainty for companies on their rights and obligations; working with business to ensure we have a 21st century workforce; refocusing our efforts with the United States to defend Canada’s trade interests; and creating a genuine partnership with businesses to reach Net Zero 2050. Canadian businesses also want to see progress on other key structural economic issues like interprovincial trade barriers, targeted infrastructure investments, cybersecurity, tax reform, and renewing privacy legislation to avoid creating a patchwork of laws across the country. The Canadian Chamber looks forward to working with all Parliamentarians and government in delivering this agenda.” For more information about the Canadian Chamber’s recommendations on What it Takes to Grow, click here.
