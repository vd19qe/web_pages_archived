Ford announced on Wednesday, March 18 that production at all of its manufacturing facilities in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico would halt after Thursday evening’s shift (March 19), with work currently scheduled to resume on March 30. The company said in a press release that they want to use that time to thoroughly clean their facilities to protect their workforce and boost containment efforts for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). “We’re continuing to work closely with union leaders, especially the United Auto Workers, to find ways to help keep our workforce healthy and safe, even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s president for North America. “In these unprecedented times, we’re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.” Galhotra said the company will work with union leaders on plant restart plans and explore protocols and procedures for helping prevent the spread of the virus. Specifically, he said, they will look for ways to maximize social distancing among plant workers, both during work hours and at shift change, when large numbers of people typically gather at entry and exit points. Galhotra said they will also look at maximizing cleaning times between shift changes. Achieving appropriate social distancing at the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant presents a challenge, as the facility has more than 4,000 employees. The move to temporarily close plants follows Sunday’s news that Ford's leaders are forming a coronavirus task force along with the United Auto Workers Union, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler leaders to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies. On Monday, Ford asked all salaried employees – except those performing business-critical roles that can’t be done offsite – to work remotely until further notice. “Especially in these challenging times, we must continue working together and putting people first,” said Galhotra. Mark Sciberras, president of Unifor Local 707, the union which represents the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant workers, also weighed in on this development on the Unifor website. ""While the announcement of a temporary layoff is never good news, we are hopeful that during this downtime the company will be able to address all of our health and safety concerns and provide a safe environment for our return to production on Monday, March 30,"" he said. ""There is no question that we are in unprecedented times due to the outbreak of COVID-19; rightfully so, many people have been concerned for their health and safety and that of their family."" Sciberras said the union has been in constant communication with the management of the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant since the start of the pandemic on March 12. He noted the health and safety of Unifor's local members is a top priority of the union's leadership, and they want to ensure the virus does not have an opportunity to spread throughout the assembly plant's workforce. ""While we have resolved some issues, despite constant dialogue we were not satisfied with the progress, as many of our concerns were unresolved,"" said Sciberras. The Unifor president said he involved the national union, and they were having high-level meetings with Ford Motor Company of Canada to resolve the union's concerns. He said progress was being made in these discussions when on Wednesday, March 18 it was announced Ford would be shutting down for a week.

Ford announced on Wednesday, March 18 that production at all of its manufacturing facilities in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico would halt after Thursday evening’s shift (March 19), with work currently scheduled to resume on March 30. The company said in a press release that they want to use that time to thoroughly clean their facilities to protect their workforce and boost containment efforts for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). “We’re continuing to work closely with union leaders, especially the United Auto Workers, to find ways to help keep our workforce healthy and safe, even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s president for North America. “In these unprecedented times, we’re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.” Galhotra said the company will work with union leaders on plant restart plans and explore protocols and procedures for helping prevent the spread of the virus. Specifically, he said, they will look for ways to maximize social distancing among plant workers, both during work hours and at shift change, when large numbers of people typically gather at entry and exit points. Galhotra said they will also look at maximizing cleaning times between shift changes. Achieving appropriate social distancing at the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant presents a challenge, as the facility has more than 4,000 employees. The move to temporarily close plants follows Sunday’s news that Ford's leaders are forming a coronavirus task force along with the United Auto Workers Union, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler leaders to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies. On Monday, Ford asked all salaried employees – except those performing business-critical roles that can’t be done offsite – to work remotely until further notice. “Especially in these challenging times, we must continue working together and putting people first,” said Galhotra. Mark Sciberras, president of Unifor Local 707, the union which represents the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant workers, also weighed in on this development on the Unifor website. ""While the announcement of a temporary layoff is never good news, we are hopeful that during this downtime the company will be able to address all of our health and safety concerns and provide a safe environment for our return to production on Monday, March 30,"" he said. ""There is no question that we are in unprecedented times due to the outbreak of COVID-19; rightfully so, many people have been concerned for their health and safety and that of their family."" Sciberras said the union has been in constant communication with the management of the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant since the start of the pandemic on March 12. He noted the health and safety of Unifor's local members is a top priority of the union's leadership, and they want to ensure the virus does not have an opportunity to spread throughout the assembly plant's workforce. ""While we have resolved some issues, despite constant dialogue we were not satisfied with the progress, as many of our concerns were unresolved,"" said Sciberras. The Unifor president said he involved the national union, and they were having high-level meetings with Ford Motor Company of Canada to resolve the union's concerns.

Ford announced on Wednesday, March 18 that production at all of its manufacturing facilities in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico would halt after Thursday evening’s shift (March 19), with work currently scheduled to resume on March 30. The company said in a press release that they want to use that time to thoroughly clean their facilities to protect their workforce and boost containment efforts for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). “We’re continuing to work closely with union leaders, especially the United Auto Workers, to find ways to help keep our workforce healthy and safe, even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s president for North America. “In these unprecedented times, we’re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.” Galhotra said the company will work with union leaders on plant restart plans and explore protocols and procedures for helping prevent the spread of the virus. Specifically, he said, they will look for ways to maximize social distancing among plant workers, both during work hours and at shift change, when large numbers of people typically gather at entry and exit points. Galhotra said they will also look at maximizing cleaning times between shift changes. Achieving appropriate social distancing at the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant presents a challenge, as the facility has more than 4,000 employees. The move to temporarily close plants follows Sunday’s news that Ford's leaders are forming a coronavirus task force along with the United Auto Workers Union, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler leaders to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies. On Monday, Ford asked all salaried employees – except those performing business-critical roles that can’t be done offsite – to work remotely until further notice. “Especially in these challenging times, we must continue working together and putting people first,” said Galhotra. Mark Sciberras, president of Unifor Local 707, the union which represents the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant workers, also weighed in on this development on the Unifor website. ""While the announcement of a temporary layoff is never good news, we are hopeful that during this downtime the company will be able to address all of our health and safety concerns and provide a safe environment for our return to production on Monday, March 30,"" he said. ""There is no question that we are in unprecedented times due to the outbreak of COVID-19; rightfully so, many people have been concerned for their health and safety and that of their family."" Sciberras said the union has been in constant communication with the management of the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant since the start of the pandemic on March 12. He noted the health and safety of Unifor's local members is a top priority of the union's leadership, and they want to ensure the virus does not have an opportunity to spread throughout the assembly plant's workforce. ""While we have resolved some issues, despite constant dialogue we were not satisfied with the progress, as many of our concerns were unresolved,"" said Sciberras. The Unifor president said he involved the national union, and they were having high-level meetings with Ford Motor Company of Canada to resolve the union's concerns. He said progress was being made in these discussions when on Wednesday, March 18 it was announced Ford would be shutting down for a week.

Ford announced on Wednesday, March 18 that production at all of its manufacturing facilities in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico would halt after Thursday evening’s shift (March 19), with work currently scheduled to resume on March 30. The company said in a press release that they want to use that time to thoroughly clean their facilities to protect their workforce and boost containment efforts for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). “We’re continuing to work closely with union leaders, especially the United Auto Workers, to find ways to help keep our workforce healthy and safe, even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s president for North America. “In these unprecedented times, we’re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.” Galhotra said the company will work with union leaders on plant restart plans and explore protocols and procedures for helping prevent the spread of the virus. Specifically, he said, they will look for ways to maximize social distancing among plant workers, both during work hours and at shift change, when large numbers of people typically gather at entry and exit points. Galhotra said they will also look at maximizing cleaning times between shift changes. Achieving appropriate social distancing at the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant presents a challenge, as the facility has more than 4,000 employees. The move to temporarily close plants follows Sunday’s news that Ford's leaders are forming a coronavirus task force along with the United Auto Workers Union, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler leaders to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies. On Monday, Ford asked all salaried employees – except those performing business-critical roles that can’t be done offsite – to work remotely until further notice. “Especially in these challenging times, we must continue working together and putting people first,” said Galhotra. Mark Sciberras, president of Unifor Local 707, the union which represents the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant workers, also weighed in on this development on the Unifor website. ""While the announcement of a temporary layoff is never good news, we are hopeful that during this downtime the company will be able to address all of our health and safety concerns and provide a safe environment for our return to production on Monday, March 30,"" he said. ""There is no question that we are in unprecedented times due to the outbreak of COVID-19; rightfully so, many people have been concerned for their health and safety and that of their family."" Sciberras said the union has been in constant communication with the management of the Oakville Ford Assembly Plant since the start of the pandemic on March 12. He noted the health and safety of Unifor's local members is a top priority of the union's leadership, and they want to ensure the virus does not have an opportunity to spread throughout the assembly plant's workforce.
