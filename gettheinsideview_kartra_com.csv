441425,20210122,gettheinsideview.kartra.com,https://gettheinsideview.kartra.com/page/workshopcheckout,text/html,text/html,en,"Vision Board Workshop LIVE WORKSHOP Virtual Vision Board Workshop Learn how to design the life of your dreams by using the Law of Attraction, growth mindset principles and the power of visualization. Join us on January 23rd from 10am-2pm as we virtually connect & create beautiful vision boards. The workshop will be held on Zoom. 0 0 DAYS 0 0 HOURS 0 0 MINUTES 0 0 SECONDS $147.00 Available for a Limited Time Order Now 100% Privacy. We Will Never Spam You! About this Event: Most of us have ideas of what we want to be, do or have in our lives. But they remain just that: ideas! After all, who has the time to get clear about what we want to create intentionally? Well, everyone from Katy Perry to Denzell Wahington, to Ellen Degeneres to Oprah Winfrey swears that they intentionally created outcomes by using the simple tools: Vision Boards, the Law of Attraction, and the Power of Visualization A Vision Board is a way to sell your ideas to yourself. It anchors your dreams into your mind and allows the magic of manifestation to work in your life. Finally! The Law of Attraction and the Power of Visualization allow you to manifest your vision board into reality! As someone who has made my Vision Boards (and manifested some excellent results!), I've learned it's more than just slapping a picture onto a poster board. My vision board proudly hangs in my office, where I stare at it all day! As we all know, 2020 has been nothing shy of challenging, but still, I managed to accomplish about 40% of my visions on my board! The other 60%... are all still work in progress! Creating a change worthy Vision board cannot be done in a 1-2 hour workshop. I've tried it - it does not work. To create long-lasting, transformative change, a real mind shift, we need to make transformational adjustments to our thinking. We need to get Crystal Clear on our WHY, our WHAT and our HOW. I've been creating Vision boards and practicing the law of attraction and visualization for over 20 years, and if there is one thing I know for sure: If you see it... You believe it... And if you know how to do it... You can achieve it! If you follow me on social media, you know that my 17-year-old son Zorique and I have a ""goal setting"" day every December, and this year is no different! This practice has allowed us to achieve outstanding success as a family. A family that works together on their goals, dreams, and visions is beyond powerful! I encourage you to join us; better yet, bring those in your circle who can be there to support your dream! First, it's about getting Crystal Clear on your authentic life, letting go of your limiting beliefs. My purpose and passion have guided me in leading our 6th annual DESIGN YOUR DREAMS Vision board workshop, virtually! This workshop will give you the space you need to design and define your dreams intentionally. Over the last six years, I've had the opportunity to lead hundreds of participants in vision board workshops. In chatting with many of the participants, they have been able to focus and achieve more than they thought possible because they could tap into the power of visualization and the law of attraction. It's time to take one day to plan the next 365 days of your life! I encourage you to take action and decide to join us this January to Design your Dreams for 2021! HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL WALK AWAY WITH: Clarity on what you want (No more settling for someone else's dreams) And a step by step blueprint on how to get there! Pre-workshop communication, so you are prepared and ready to get working! Time to map out your ideal outcomes in each area of your life Personally and professionally Spiritually, mentally, financially, and physically. Connection with like-minded peers (No Negative Nellies permitted!) A method of losing the limiting beliefs for good! (Time to let go!) All the tools and time to create your own powerful Vision Board (the Pre-workshop material is designed to make sure you are prepared for our live virtual session) Your very own Vision Board that attracts your ideal outcomes in the months and years ahead.

Join us on February 13th from 10am-2pm as we virtually connect & create beautiful vision boards. The workshop will be held on Zoom. 0 0 DAYS 0 0 HOURS 0 0 MINUTES 0 0 SECONDS $147.00 Available for a Limited Time Order Now 100% Privacy. We Will Never Spam You! About this Event: Most of us have ideas of what we want to be, do or have in our lives. But they remain just that: ideas! After all, who has the time to get clear about what we want to create intentionally? Well, everyone from Katy Perry to Denzell Wahington, to Ellen Degeneres to Oprah Winfrey swears that they intentionally created outcomes by using the simple tools: Vision Boards, the Law of Attraction, and the Power of Visualization A Vision Board is a way to sell your ideas to yourself. It anchors your dreams into your mind and allows the magic of manifestation to work in your life. Finally! The Law of Attraction and the Power of Visualization allow you to manifest your vision board into reality! As someone who has made my Vision Boards (and manifested some excellent results!), I've learned it's more than just slapping a picture onto a poster board. My vision board proudly hangs in my office, where I stare at it all day! As we all know, 2020 has been nothing shy of challenging, but still, I managed to accomplish about 40% of my visions on my board! The other 60%... are all still work in progress! Creating a change worthy Vision board cannot be done in a 1-2 hour workshop. I've tried it - it does not work. To create long-lasting, transformative change, a real mind shift, we need to make transformational adjustments to our thinking. We need to get Crystal Clear on our WHY, our WHAT and our HOW. I've been creating Vision boards and practicing the law of attraction and visualization for over 20 years, and if there is one thing I know for sure: If you see it... You believe it... And if you know how to do it... You can achieve it! If you follow me on social media, you know that my 17-year-old son Zorique and I have a ""goal setting"" day every December, and this year is no different! This practice has allowed us to achieve outstanding success as a family. A family that works together on their goals, dreams, and visions is beyond powerful! I encourage you to join us; better yet, bring those in your circle who can be there to support your dream! First, it's about getting Crystal Clear on your authentic life, letting go of your limiting beliefs. My purpose and passion have guided me in leading our 6th annual DESIGN YOUR DREAMS Vision board workshop, virtually! This workshop will give you the space you need to design and define your dreams intentionally. Over the last six years, I've had the opportunity to lead hundreds of participants in vision board workshops. In chatting with many of the participants, they have been able to focus and achieve more than they thought possible because they could tap into the power of visualization and the law of attraction. It's time to take one day to plan the next 365 days of your life! I encourage you to take action and decide to join us this January to Design your Dreams for 2021! HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL WALK AWAY WITH: Clarity on what you want (No more settling for someone else's dreams) And a step by step blueprint on how to get there! Pre-workshop communication, so you are prepared and ready to get working! Time to map out your ideal outcomes in each area of your life Personally and professionally Spiritually, mentally, financially, and physically. Connection with like-minded peers (No Negative Nellies permitted!) A method of losing the limiting beliefs for good! (Time to let go!) All the tools and time to create your own powerful Vision Board (the Pre-workshop material is designed to make sure you are prepared for our live virtual session) Your very own Vision Board that attracts your ideal outcomes in the months and years ahead.
