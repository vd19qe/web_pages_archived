Notwithstanding Council's decision, Interim CAO Sheldon Randall and Lord Mayor Betty Disero, with the support of the Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce, used their delegated authority to make changes to the details of the pilot program. This decision was made in response to comments received by residents and business owners, following the Town's announcement of the temporary closure to vehicular traffic, as approved by Council. Revised Closure Details: Trial Closure Dates: Wednesday, July 1, 2020, and every Saturday and Sunday from Saturday, July 4, 2020, to Sunday, July 19, 2020* Trial Closure Location: Queen Street, east of the Old Town Post Office to King Street Trial Closure Time Frame: 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM each day of the closure *Dates of trial subject to change. Neither the Old Town Post Office nor the Hendriks Valu Mart will be included in the street closure to vehicular traffic. Parking at both establishments will remain for patrons only. Town Staff will provide a report to Council reviewing the success of the closure and will make a recommendation as to whether the weekend and statutory holiday closure of Queen Street should be extended for the rest of July, into August and beyond. Separate from temporary approval of patio expansions, this temporary closure is not intended to allow businesses to encroach out onto the Municipal right of way, rather, to promote and support physical distancing measures among those wishing to visit the Heritage District. Town Council is hopeful that this temporary closure will aid in protecting the health and safety of community members and visitors while assisting businesses during this recovery phase. Tenants and Employees: Alternative parking is being arranged for Queen Street tenants and employees.

Notwithstanding Council's decision, Interim CAO Sheldon Randall and Lord Mayor Betty Disero, with the support of the Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce, used their delegated authority to make changes to the details of the pilot program. This decision was made in response to comments received by residents and business owners, following the Town's announcement of the temporary closure to vehicular traffic, as approved by Council. Revised Closure Details: Trial Closure Dates: Wednesday, July 1, 2020, and every Saturday and Sunday from Saturday, July 4, 2020, to Sunday, July 19, 2020* Trial Closure Location: Queen Street, east of the Old Town Post Office to King Street Trial Closure Time Frame: 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM each day of the closure *Dates of trial subject to change. Neither the Old Town Post Office nor the Hendriks Valu Mart will be included in the street closure to vehicular traffic. Parking at both establishments will remain for patrons only. Town Staff will provide a report to Council reviewing the success of the closure and will make a recommendation as to whether the weekend and statutory holiday closure of Queen Street should be extended for the rest of July, into August and beyond. Separate from temporary approval of patio expansions, this temporary closure is not intended to allow businesses to encroach out onto the Municipal right of way, rather, to promote and support physical distancing measures among those wishing to visit the Heritage District. Town Council is hopeful that this temporary closure will aid in protecting the health and safety of community members and visitors while assisting businesses during this recovery phase. Tenants and Employees: Alternative parking is being arranged for Queen Street tenants and employees.

The program was initially proposed by Council and was voted on and approved at the June 26, 2020, Special Council Meeting. Notwithstanding Council's decision, Interim CAO Sheldon Randall and Lord Mayor Betty Disero, with the support of the Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce, used their delegated authority to make changes to the details of the pilot program on June 29, 2020. Rather than closing the whole of Queen Street from east of the Post Office to King Street, as was done previously, that same area will instead see a widening of the walkway by converting existing parking spaces into pedestrian space, leaving room for vehicle flow. Additionally, a portion of Regent Street, north of Queen Street between the Stage Coach Family Restaurant and Greaves Jam and Marmalades, will be blocked off to create extra leisure and seating space for visitors. Access to the municipal parking lot off of Regent Street will remain accessible. This closure plan will be effective for the next two weekends, beginning Friday and ending Monday. Town Staff will be erecting fencing to identify the extended walkway area. The setup and takedown process may take several hours to complete during which time Staff will assist with traffic control. To execute this change, parking will not be available within this section of Queen Street from early Friday morning to late Monday morning. While these revisions to the pilot program are slated to last two weekends, adjustments may be made as deemed necessary by the Town, in conjunction with the Chamber. Tenants and Employees: Alternative parking is being arranged for Queen Street tenants and employees. For further details, or to obtain a parking permit, please contact the Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce at tourism@niagaraonthelake.com or (905) 468-1950. We welcome your feedback! Whether you're loving this pilot program idea or have some reservations, we'd love to hear your thoughts! Please take a few minutes to join the conversation by completing the survey below and providing your comments regarding this trial closure of Queen Street to vehicular traffic. Survey closes July 31st. *New survey will be posted by noon on Friday, July 18, 2020.* As public feedback is vital to this process, Town Staff will be walking Queen Street over the weekend with iPads, soliciting engagement from the public. The first survey, specific to the original closure plan, closed on July 16, 2020. Responses to the first and second survey will be summarized and provided to Council to assist in comparing options and determining future action as it relates to Queen Street. After two weeks of the Queen Street Pilot Program, which temporarily closed Queen Street to vehicular traffic on weekends and Canada Day, the Town, with support from the Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce, has decided to make further adjustments to the closure to relieve traffic congestion in the surrounding residential areas while still creating additional space for physical distancing measures. The program was initially proposed by Council and was voted on and approved at the June 26, 2020, Special Council Meeting. Notwithstanding Council's decision, Interim CAO Sheldon Randall and Lord Mayor Betty Disero, with the support of the Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce, used their delegated authority to make changes to the details of the pilot program on June 29, 2020. Rather than closing the whole of Queen Street from east of the Post Office to King Street, as was done previously, that same area will instead see a widening of the walkway by converting existing parking spaces into pedestrian space, leaving room for vehicle flow. Additionally, a portion of Regent Street, north of Queen Street between the Stage Coach Family Restaurant and Greaves Jam and Marmalades, will be blocked off to create extra leisure and seating space for visitors. Access to the municipal parking lot off of Regent Street will remain accessible. This closure plan will be effective for the next two weekends, beginning Friday and ending Monday. Town Staff will be erecting fencing to identify the extended walkway area. The setup and takedown process may take several hours to complete during which time Staff will assist with traffic control. To execute this change, parking will not be available within this section of Queen Street from early Friday morning to late Monday morning. While these revisions to the pilot program are slated to last two weekends, adjustments may be made as deemed necessary by the Town, in conjunction with the Chamber. Tenants and Employees: Alternative parking is being arranged for Queen Street tenants and employees.
