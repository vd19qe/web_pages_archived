You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account.

Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Download a fresh copy Firefox Monitor Unlock more from the Firefox suite: Sync, Monitor, Lockwise and more. Start Now Firefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known data breach. See if your information was exposed in a data breach, learn how to take action to better protect your online accounts, and get alerted if your information appears in a new breach. You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account. See also Firefox Lockwise - Alerts for breached websites about alerts in Firefox for saved logins and passwords exposed in known data breaches. Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Download a fresh copy Firefox Monitor Unlock more from the Firefox suite: Sync, Monitor, Lockwise and more. Start Now Firefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known data breach. See if your information was exposed in a data breach, learn how to take action to better protect your online accounts, and get alerted if your information appears in a new breach. You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account. See also Firefox Lockwise - Alerts for breached websites about alerts in Firefox for saved logins and passwords exposed in known data breaches. Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Start Now Firefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known data breach. See if your information was exposed in a data breach, learn how to take action to better protect your online accounts, and get alerted if your information appears in a new breach. You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account. See also Firefox Lockwise - Alerts for breached websites about alerts in Firefox for saved logins and passwords exposed in known data breaches. Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address.

If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Start Now Firefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known data breach. See if your information was exposed in a data breach, learn how to take action to better protect your online accounts, and get alerted if your information appears in a new breach. You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account. See also Firefox Lockwise - Alerts for breached websites about alerts in Firefox for saved logins and passwords exposed in known data breaches. Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Start Now Firefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known data breach. See if your information was exposed in a data breach, learn how to take action to better protect your online accounts, and get alerted if your information appears in a new breach. You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account. See also Firefox Lockwise - Alerts for breached websites about alerts in Firefox for saved logins and passwords exposed in known data breaches. Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Start Now Firefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known data breach. See if your information was exposed in a data breach, learn how to take action to better protect your online accounts, and get alerted if your information appears in a new breach. You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account. See also Firefox Lockwise - Alerts for breached websites about alerts in Firefox for saved logins and passwords exposed in known data breaches. Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

Start Now Firefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known data breach. See if your information was exposed in a data breach, learn how to take action to better protect your online accounts, and get alerted if your information appears in a new breach. You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account. See also Firefox Lockwise - Alerts for breached websites about alerts in Firefox for saved logins and passwords exposed in known data breaches. Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account.

Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account.

Table of Contents 1 See if you've been part of a known breach 2 Monitor your email for future breaches 3 Monitor multiple emails for new breaches 4 Receive desktop browser alerts 5 Frequently asked questions See if you've been part of a known breach To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.

You can enroll multiple email addresses for breach alerts from a single Firefox Account.

Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page. Click Sign in to sign in to your Firefox Account. Click the Breaches tab on the new page. From here, you can browse or search for specific breaches. To see if your online accounts have been exposed in a known data breach, visit https://monitor.firefox.com/ and enter your email address. You can see what personal data was compromised and when. This basic search will surface most data breaches, but not ones that contain sensitive personal information. Monitor your email for future breaches Firefox Monitor can send you breach notifications so you can take actions to protect your account. To sign up for notifications: Click the Firefox Account icon in the toolbar. Click Firefox Monitor to open the Firefox Monitor report page and sign in if you haven't already. Click Manage email addresses in the E-mails section. Add a checkmark next to your desired setting. Send breach alerts to affected email address to send emails to the affected address. Send breach alerts to [email address] to send all alerts to a designated address even if it's not linked to your Firefox Account. If you want to receive Firefox Monitor alerts and your complete breach summary (which may contain breaches with sensitive information), create a Firefox Account: Visit https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Sign up for Alerts and create a password. Check your email for a verification link. This link expires in 24 hours. After verifying your address, you’ll be able to see your complete breach summary on your Firefox Monitor dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if your email address appears in a new data breach. Already have a Firefox Account? Sign in via https://monitor.firefox.com/ to see your summary of past breaches and automatically opt in for breach alerts. Firefox Monitor will send you an email if your information appears in a future data breach. Monitor multiple emails for new breaches In addition to your primary Firefox Account email, you can get breach alert sent to other email addresses. You don't have to link these email addresses to a new Firefox Account. Log in to your Firefox Account via https://monitor.firefox.com/. Select Manage Email Addresses to access your Monitor Preferences. Enter the new email address in the email field. Select Send Verification Link. Check to see if a verification link was sent to that email (this link expires in 24 hours). After verifying your address, you’ll see another breach summary on your dashboard. You’ll receive an alert if this email address appears in a new data breach. Receive desktop browser alerts If you use the desktop version of Firefox and visit websites in our list of breaches, you’ll receive an alert in your browser. This directs you to Firefox Monitor where you can see if your account is at risk. You will not see these alerts more than once per website. When you browse a site with a known data breach, you’ll receive a message similar to this: You can do any of the following from this prompt: Select Check Firefox Monitor to see if your information was exposed when this website was breached. Select Dismiss to ignore the alert. Select the drop-down arrow next to Dismiss and then select Never show Firefox Monitor alerts to dismiss all Firefox Monitor alerts on all sites.
