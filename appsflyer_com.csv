But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links.

Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications.

And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition.

Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Web-to-App Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat.

Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch.

Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more.

App Install Detection for Seamless User Experience OneLink detects whether a user has already installed your app. Using deferred deep linking, this incredibly powerful single link will send new users to the appropriate app store first; then it will direct users to the correct destination after the app is installed.

This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened. For brands selling products or services in their apps, any additional step between users and their intended goal translates into lower conversion rates.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Web-to-App Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links.

Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications.

Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more.

You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more. Trusted by the world’s leading brands OneLink and You’re Covered Acquire. Retain. Engage. Convert.

Whether it’s a link in an email or in a Facebook post, you can count on OneLink to work perfectly every time. App Install Detection for Seamless User Experience OneLink detects whether a user has already installed your app. Using deferred deep linking, this incredibly powerful single link will send new users to the appropriate app store first; then it will direct users to the correct destination after the app is installed. If a user has already installed your app, the link will open the right page directly in the app. Contextual Delivery For Powerful Conversions AppsFlyer deep links contain rich information about users and their location within the customer journey: what campaign they came from, who referred them, what content they saw when clicking on the link, and more. This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened. For brands selling products or services in their apps, any additional step between users and their intended goal translates into lower conversion rates. OneLink removes extraneous steps and drives users directly to the in-app point of sale — even after install.

This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences.

Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition.

Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more. Trusted by the world’s leading brands OneLink and You’re Covered Acquire. Retain. Engage. Convert.

App Install Detection for Seamless User Experience OneLink detects whether a user has already installed your app. Using deferred deep linking, this incredibly powerful single link will send new users to the appropriate app store first; then it will direct users to the correct destination after the app is installed. If a user has already installed your app, the link will open the right page directly in the app. Contextual Delivery For Powerful Conversions AppsFlyer deep links contain rich information about users and their location within the customer journey: what campaign they came from, who referred them, what content they saw when clicking on the link, and more. This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened. For brands selling products or services in their apps, any additional step between users and their intended goal translates into lower conversion rates. OneLink removes extraneous steps and drives users directly to the in-app point of sale — even after install.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more. Trusted by the world’s leading brands OneLink and You’re Covered Acquire. Retain. Engage. Convert. Deploy Any Use Case Simplify growth and acquisition with one link that works on every channel and platform. Capitalize on Your Assets Maximize ROI on owned, paid, and earned media by ensuring seamless customer journeys.

OneLink Customers Show Higher ROI 2.5X Conversion Rate Frictionless experiences lead to dramatically higher conversion 2.7X In-App Purchases Users that click on deep links buy more frequently 2.1X User Retention Contextual delivery keeps users coming back for more Source: Data from AppsFlyer customers using OneLink vs. customers using regular links Universal Accessibility and Compatibility for Simplicity OneLink works seamlessly across every single platform, app, and environment. Unlike other universal mobile deep linking platforms, OneLink works with the latest iOS and Android builds, without any custom configurations or interstitial pages. Whether it’s a link in an email or in a Facebook post, you can count on OneLink to work perfectly every time. App Install Detection for Seamless User Experience OneLink detects whether a user has already installed your app. Using deferred deep linking, this incredibly powerful single link will send new users to the appropriate app store first; then it will direct users to the correct destination after the app is installed. If a user has already installed your app, the link will open the right page directly in the app. Contextual Delivery For Powerful Conversions AppsFlyer deep links contain rich information about users and their location within the customer journey: what campaign they came from, who referred them, what content they saw when clicking on the link, and more. This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened. For brands selling products or services in their apps, any additional step between users and their intended goal translates into lower conversion rates. OneLink removes extraneous steps and drives users directly to the in-app point of sale — even after install.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more.

If a user has already installed your app, the link will open the right page directly in the app. Contextual Delivery For Powerful Conversions AppsFlyer deep links contain rich information about users and their location within the customer journey: what campaign they came from, who referred them, what content they saw when clicking on the link, and more. This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened. For brands selling products or services in their apps, any additional step between users and their intended goal translates into lower conversion rates.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more. Trusted by the world’s leading brands OneLink and You’re Covered Acquire. Retain. Engage. Convert. Deploy Any Use Case Simplify growth and acquisition with one link that works on every channel and platform. Capitalize on Your Assets Maximize ROI on owned, paid, and earned media by ensuring seamless customer journeys.

Unlike other universal mobile deep linking platforms, OneLink works with the latest iOS and Android builds, without any custom configurations or interstitial pages. Whether it’s a link in an email or in a Facebook post, you can count on OneLink to work perfectly every time. App Install Detection for Seamless User Experience OneLink detects whether a user has already installed your app. Using deferred deep linking, this incredibly powerful single link will send new users to the appropriate app store first; then it will direct users to the correct destination after the app is installed. If a user has already installed your app, the link will open the right page directly in the app. Contextual Delivery For Powerful Conversions AppsFlyer deep links contain rich information about users and their location within the customer journey: what campaign they came from, who referred them, what content they saw when clicking on the link, and more. This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened. For brands selling products or services in their apps, any additional step between users and their intended goal translates into lower conversion rates. OneLink removes extraneous steps and drives users directly to the in-app point of sale — even after install.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing.

Deep Links to Power Any Use Case Web-to-App Email Social SMS/Push Referrals Create Frictionless Web-to-App Journeys Your customers often begin their journeys on mobile web where they discover your brand and the potential value of your app. And mobile web is becoming increasingly important as a growth channel, especially with savvy users that need motivation to install and use an app. By directing high-intent organic traffic to your website, you can educate and engage potential users. You can also combine first-party data with OneLink-powered Smart Banners and content to drive growth through personalized and contextualized web-to-app experiences. Streamline Email-to-App Experiences Email continues to play a pivotal role in marketing. But because ESPs “wrap” their links as part of their attribution integration, they often break, resulting in frustrated customers and lost business. Enter OneLink, which works its magic to “unwrap” ESP-wrapped links, without losing attribution and contextual data. OneLink enables marketers to route users to the optimal destination – landing page, app store, contextual in-app experience – on any OS, channel, and platform, ensuring a smooth experience and an end to broken links. Integrated with your favorite ESPs: Drive Organic Growth from Social Media Tap into the power of deep linking to deliver a smooth customer experience while measuring engagement, installs, and loyalty attributable to your social media posts, whether on Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Pinterest, Instagram, or Snapchat. You can even run promotions that incentivize your fans and followers based on how many downloads they can drive. With OneLink deep linking, every click and every action is always measurable. Always. Powerful Short Deep Links for SMS and Push Notifications Engage your customers with discounts, limited-time offers, and other incentives via SMS marketing and push notifications. But be advised: when crafting messages, every character counts and compact URLs are a must. OneLink enables marketers to dynamically create short links for use in SMS and push marketing. When users click the deep link, they are directed to the optimal destination – to the app store if they don’t have the app, and to the app if they do. And of course, every new install will be attributed to the right message, channel, and campaign. Unleash the Power of Word-of-Mouth Every marketer knows that word-of-mouth referrals are one of the most effective and potent ways to create virality and generate acquisition. With AppsFlyer User Invites, hacking word-of-mouth is a cinch. Existing users wishing to “share” or “invite a friend” are prompted to select the channel for spreading the word: SMS, email, social, etc. After the user chooses the channel, a deep link is automatically generated for easy sharing. Once the invite is sent, you can measure user behavior and optimize future marketing efforts by understanding which users are most likely to invite friends, their preferred channels, and more. Trusted by the world’s leading brands OneLink and You’re Covered Acquire. Retain. Engage. Convert. Deploy Any Use Case Simplify growth and acquisition with one link that works on every channel and platform. Capitalize on Your Assets Maximize ROI on owned, paid, and earned media by ensuring seamless customer journeys. Personalize Onboarding Delight users with contextual experiences powered by rich user data contained in our deep links. Optimize Conversions Create frictionless user experiences that spur higher intent and lift your bottom line. OneLink Customers Show Higher ROI 2.5X Conversion Rate Frictionless experiences lead to dramatically higher conversion 2.7X In-App Purchases Users that click on deep links buy more frequently 2.1X User Retention Contextual delivery keeps users coming back for more Source: Data from AppsFlyer customers using OneLink vs. customers using regular links Universal Accessibility and Compatibility for Simplicity OneLink works seamlessly across every single platform, app, and environment. Unlike other universal mobile deep linking platforms, OneLink works with the latest iOS and Android builds, without any custom configurations or interstitial pages. Whether it’s a link in an email or in a Facebook post, you can count on OneLink to work perfectly every time. App Install Detection for Seamless User Experience OneLink detects whether a user has already installed your app. Using deferred deep linking, this incredibly powerful single link will send new users to the appropriate app store first; then it will direct users to the correct destination after the app is installed. If a user has already installed your app, the link will open the right page directly in the app. Contextual Delivery For Powerful Conversions AppsFlyer deep links contain rich information about users and their location within the customer journey: what campaign they came from, who referred them, what content they saw when clicking on the link, and more. This rich contextual information eliminates journey friction, delivering a relevant experience when the app is opened. For brands selling products or services in their apps, any additional step between users and their intended goal translates into lower conversion rates. OneLink removes extraneous steps and drives users directly to the in-app point of sale — even after install.
