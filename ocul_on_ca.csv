It is a 2.5 year initiative to digitize and georeference early-to-mid 20th century historical topographic maps covering the province of Ontario at the scales of 1:25,000 and 1:63,360. The goal is to create and provide access to high-resolution map scans that preserve historical topographic information and meet the needs of current and future users. The maps on the home page represent a sampling of the over 1000 maps in the historical topographic maps collection. Please select Full Collection below to view more.
