Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.

Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords Text Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub.

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords Text Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL URL of the item.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

See How we work for more details. WebPage Thing > CreativeWork > WebPage A web page. Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords Text Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL URL of the item.

See How we work for more details. WebPage Thing > CreativeWork > WebPage A web page. Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords Text Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL URL of the item.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/WebPage Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords Text Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. pattern DefinedTerm or Text A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. size DefinedTerm or QuantitativeValue or Text A standardized size of a product or creative work, often simplifying richer information into a simple textual string, either through referring to named sizes or (in the case of product markup), by adopting conventional simplifications. Use of QuantitativeValue with a unitCode or unitText can add more structure; in other cases, the /width, /height, /depth and /weight properties may be more applicable. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL URL of the item.

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/WebPage Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource.

Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords Text Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. pattern DefinedTerm or Text A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. size DefinedTerm or QuantitativeValue or Text A standardized size of a product or creative work, often simplifying richer information into a simple textual string, either through referring to named sizes or (in the case of product markup), by adopting conventional simplifications. Use of QuantitativeValue with a unitCode or unitText can add more structure; in other cases, the /width, /height, /depth and /weight properties may be more applicable. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL URL of the item.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/WebPage Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords Text Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. pattern DefinedTerm or Text A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. size DefinedTerm or QuantitativeValue or Text A standardized size of a product or creative work, often simplifying richer information into a simple textual string, either through referring to named sizes or (in the case of product markup), by adopting conventional simplifications. Use of QuantitativeValue with a unitCode or unitText can add more structure; in other cases, the /width, /height, /depth and /weight properties may be more applicable. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL URL of the item.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages.

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/WebPage Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords DefinedTerm or Text or URL Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. pattern DefinedTerm or Text A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. size DefinedTerm or QuantitativeValue or Text A standardized size of a product or creative work, often simplifying richer information into a simple textual string, either through referring to named sizes or (in the case of product markup), by adopting conventional simplifications. Use of QuantitativeValue with a unitCode or unitText can add more structure; in other cases, the /width, /height, /depth and /weight properties may be more applicable. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL URL of the item.

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/WebPage Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords DefinedTerm or Text or URL Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. pattern DefinedTerm or Text A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. size DefinedTerm or QuantitativeValue or Text A standardized size of a product or creative work, often simplifying richer information into a simple textual string, either through referring to named sizes or (in the case of product markup), by adopting conventional simplifications. Use of QuantitativeValue with a unitCode or unitText can add more structure; in other cases, the /width, /height, /depth and /weight properties may be more applicable. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/WebPage Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork. encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample. expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf. headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart. keywords DefinedTerm or Text or URL Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage. maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. pattern DefinedTerm or Text A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. size DefinedTerm or QuantitativeValue or Text A standardized size of a product or creative work, often simplifying richer information into a simple textual string, either through referring to named sizes or (in the case of product markup), by adopting conventional simplifications. Use of QuantitativeValue with a unitCode or unitText can add more structure; in other cases, the /width, /height, /depth and /weight properties may be more applicable. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg.

Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity.

Property Expected Type Description Properties from Event about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. actor Person An actor, e.g. in tv, radio, movie, video games etc., or in an event. Actors can be associated with individual items or with a series, episode, clip. Supersedes actors. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. attendee Organization or Person A person or organization attending the event. Supersedes attendees. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. composer Organization or Person The person or organization who wrote a composition, or who is the composer of a work performed at some event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. director Person A director of e.g. tv, radio, movie, video gaming etc. content, or of an event.

There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months or seasons. eventStatus EventStatusType An eventStatus of an event represents its status; particularly useful when an event is cancelled or rescheduled. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action.

Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

Ticketing information may be added via the offers property. Repeated events may be structured as separate Event objects. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/Event Equivalent Class: dctype:Event Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from Event about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf. actor Person An actor, e.g. in tv, radio, movie, video games etc., or in an event. Actors can be associated with individual items or with a series, episode, clip. Supersedes actors. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. attendee Organization or Person A person or organization attending the event. Supersedes attendees. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. composer Organization or Person The person or organization who wrote a composition, or who is the composer of a work performed at some event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. director Person A director of e.g. tv, radio, movie, video gaming etc. content, or of an event. Directors can be associated with individual items or with a series, episode, clip. Supersedes directors. doorTime DateTime or Time The time admission will commence. duration Duration The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in ISO 8601 date format. endDate Date or DateTime The end date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format). eventAttendanceMode EventAttendanceModeEnumeration The eventAttendanceMode of an event indicates whether it occurs online, offline, or a mix. eventSchedule Schedule Associates an Event with a Schedule. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months or seasons. eventStatus EventStatusType An eventStatus of an event represents its status; particularly useful when an event is cancelled or rescheduled. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. location Place or PostalAddress or Text or VirtualLocation The location of for example where the event is happening, an organization is located, or where an action takes place. maximumAttendeeCapacity Integer The total number of individuals that may attend an event or venue. maximumPhysicalAttendeeCapacity Integer The maximum physical attendee capacity of an Event whose eventAttendanceMode is OfflineEventAttendanceMode (or the offline aspects, in the case of a MixedEventAttendanceMode). maximumVirtualAttendeeCapacity Integer The maximum physical attendee capacity of an Event whose eventAttendanceMode is OnlineEventAttendanceMode (or the online aspects, in the case of a MixedEventAttendanceMode). offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered. organizer Organization or Person An organizer of an Event. performer Organization or Person A performer at the event—for example, a presenter, musician, musical group or actor. Supersedes performers. previousStartDate Date Used in conjunction with eventStatus for rescheduled or cancelled events. This property contains the previously scheduled start date. For rescheduled events, the startDate property should be used for the newly scheduled start date.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

See How we work for more details. WebPage A Schema.org Type Thing > CreativeWork > WebPage [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/WebPage Leave public feedback on this term 💬 Check for open issues. A web page. Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as breadcrumb may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page. Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList or Text A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization or Person People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification or URL Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies. Properties from CreativeWork about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf abstract Text An abstract is a short description that summarizes a CreativeWork. accessMode Text The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual, colorDependent, chartOnVisual, chemOnVisual, diagramOnVisual, mathOnVisual, musicOnVisual, textOnVisual. accessModeSufficient ItemList A list of single or combined accessModes that are sufficient to understand all the intellectual content of a resource. Expected values include: auditory, tactile, textual, visual. accessibilityAPI Text Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityControl Text Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityFeature Text Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilityHazard Text A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3 (WebSchemas wiki lists possible values). accessibilitySummary Text A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as ""short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users"" or ""short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed."" accountablePerson Person Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. acquireLicensePage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. alternativeHeadline Text A secondary title of the CreativeWork. assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. associatedMedia MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. audio AudioObject or Clip or MusicRecording An embedded audio object. author Organization or Person The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. award Text An award won by or for this item. Supersedes awards. character Person Fictional person connected with a creative work. citation CreativeWork or Text A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. comment Comment Comments, typically from users. commentCount Integer The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. conditionsOfAccess Text Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an ArchiveComponent held by an ArchiveOrganization. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language. For example ""Available by appointment from the Reading Room"" or ""Accessible only from logged-in accounts "". contentLocation Place The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting. contentRating Rating or Text Official rating of a piece of content—for example,'MPAA PG-13'. contentReferenceTime DateTime The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. copyrightHolder Organization or Person The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. copyrightNotice Text Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. copyrightYear Number The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. correction CorrectionComment or Text or URL Indicates a correction to a CreativeWork, either via a CorrectionComment, textually or in another document. creativeWorkStatus DefinedTerm or Text The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle. creator Organization or Person The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. creditText Text Text that can be used to credit person(s) and/or organization(s) associated with a published Creative Work. dateCreated Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. dateModified Date or DateTime The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or when the item's entry was modified within a DataFeed. datePublished Date or DateTime Date of first broadcast/publication. discussionUrl URL A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork. editEIDR Text or URL An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) identifier representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose titleEIDR is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"", has several edits e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"". Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description. editor Person Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. educationalAlignment AlignmentObject An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. educationalUse DefinedTerm or Text The purpose of a work in the context of education; for example, 'assignment', 'group work'. encoding MediaObject A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. Supersedes encodings. Inverse property: encodesCreativeWork encodingFormat Text or URL Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.). In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information. Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat. exampleOfWork CreativeWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. Inverse property: workExample expires Date Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a VideoObject or NewsArticle whose availability or relevance is time-limited, or a ClaimReview fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. genre Text or URL Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. hasPart CreativeWork Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense). Inverse property: isPartOf headline Text Headline of the article. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage. Supersedes language. interactionStatistic InteractionCounter The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes interactionCount. interactivityType Text The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. isAccessibleForFree Boolean A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isBasedOn CreativeWork or Product or URL A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaption. Supersedes isBasedOnUrl. isFamilyFriendly Boolean Indicates whether this content is family friendly. isPartOf CreativeWork or URL Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. Inverse property: hasPart keywords DefinedTerm or Text or URL Keywords or tags used to describe this content. Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas. learningResourceType DefinedTerm or Text The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. license CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL. locationCreated Place The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. mainEntity Thing Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage maintainer Organization or Person A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on ""upstream"" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. material Product or Text or URL A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. materialExtent QuantitativeValue or Text The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. mentions Thing Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered pattern DefinedTerm or Text A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. position Integer or Text The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. producer Organization or Person The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, tv/radio series etc.). provider Organization or Person The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Supersedes carrier. publication PublicationEvent A publication event associated with the item. publisher Organization or Person The publisher of the creative work. publisherImprint Organization The publishing division which published the comic. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork or URL The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn releasedEvent PublicationEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. schemaVersion Text or URL Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. For example, a document could declare a schemaVersion using an URL such as http://schema.org/version/2.0/ if precise indication of schema version was required by some application. sdDatePublished Date Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork or URL A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization or Person Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. size DefinedTerm or QuantitativeValue or Text A standardized size of a product or creative work, often simplifying richer information into a simple textual string, either through referring to named sizes or (in the case of product markup), by adopting conventional simplifications. Use of QuantitativeValue with a unitCode or unitText can add more structure; in other cases, the /width, /height, /depth and /weight properties may be more applicable. sourceOrganization Organization The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place The ""spatial"" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. temporal DateTime or Text The ""temporal"" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime or Text or URL The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written ""2011/2012""). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via ""1939/1945"". Open-ended date ranges can be written with "".."" in place of the end date. For example, ""2015-11/.."" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. usageInfo CreativeWork or URL The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. version Number or Text The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip or VideoObject An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork workTranslation CreativeWork A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

Event type: Education event. Property Expected Type Description Properties from EducationEvent assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Properties from Event about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf actor Person An actor, e.g. in tv, radio, movie, video games etc., or in an event. Actors can be associated with individual items or with a series, episode, clip. Supersedes actors. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. attendee Organization or Person A person or organization attending the event. Supersedes attendees. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. composer Organization or Person The person or organization who wrote a composition, or who is the composer of a work performed at some event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. director Person A director of e.g. tv, radio, movie, video gaming etc. content, or of an event.

There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months or seasons. eventStatus EventStatusType An eventStatus of an event represents its status; particularly useful when an event is cancelled or rescheduled. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action.

Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered organizer Organization or Person An organizer of an Event. performer Organization or Person A performer at the event—for example, a presenter, musician, musical group or actor. Supersedes performers. previousStartDate Date Used in conjunction with eventStatus for rescheduled or cancelled events. This property contains the previously scheduled start date. For rescheduled events, the startDate property should be used for the newly scheduled start date. In the (rare) case of an event that has been postponed and rescheduled multiple times, this field may be repeated. recordedIn CreativeWork The CreativeWork that captured all or part of this Event. Inverse property: recordedAt remainingAttendeeCapacity Integer The number of attendee places for an event that remain unallocated. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. startDate Date or DateTime The start date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format). subEvent Event An Event that is part of this event. For example, a conference event includes many presentations, each of which is a subEvent of the conference. Supersedes subEvents.

Inverse property: subEvent translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. workFeatured CreativeWork A work featured in some event, e.g. exhibited in an ExhibitionEvent. Specific subproperties are available for workPerformed (e.g. a play), or a workPresented (a Movie at a ScreeningEvent). workPerformed CreativeWork A work performed in some event, for example a play performed in a TheaterEvent. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description.

Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

Supersedes actors. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. attendee Organization or Person A person or organization attending the event. Supersedes attendees. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. composer Organization or Person The person or organization who wrote a composition, or who is the composer of a work performed at some event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. director Person A director of e.g. tv, radio, movie, video gaming etc. content, or of an event. Directors can be associated with individual items or with a series, episode, clip. Supersedes directors. doorTime DateTime or Time The time admission will commence. duration Duration The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in ISO 8601 date format. endDate Date or DateTime The end date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format). eventAttendanceMode EventAttendanceModeEnumeration The eventAttendanceMode of an event indicates whether it occurs online, offline, or a mix. eventSchedule Schedule Associates an Event with a Schedule. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months or seasons. eventStatus EventStatusType An eventStatus of an event represents its status; particularly useful when an event is cancelled or rescheduled. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage.

Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered organizer Organization or Person An organizer of an Event. performer Organization or Person A performer at the event—for example, a presenter, musician, musical group or actor. Supersedes performers. previousStartDate Date Used in conjunction with eventStatus for rescheduled or cancelled events. This property contains the previously scheduled start date. For rescheduled events, the startDate property should be used for the newly scheduled start date. In the (rare) case of an event that has been postponed and rescheduled multiple times, this field may be repeated. recordedIn CreativeWork The CreativeWork that captured all or part of this Event. Inverse property: recordedAt remainingAttendeeCapacity Integer The number of attendee places for an event that remain unallocated. review Review A review of the item.

Specific subproperties are available for workPerformed (e.g. a play), or a workPresented (a Movie at a ScreeningEvent). workPerformed CreativeWork A work performed in some event, for example a play performed in a TheaterEvent. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.

For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months or seasons. eventStatus EventStatusType An eventStatus of an event represents its status; particularly useful when an event is cancelled or rescheduled. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action.

Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered organizer Organization or Person An organizer of an Event. performer Organization or Person A performer at the event—for example, a presenter, musician, musical group or actor. Supersedes performers. previousStartDate Date Used in conjunction with eventStatus for rescheduled or cancelled events. This property contains the previously scheduled start date.

Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types.

Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!

Event type: Education event. Property Expected Type Description Properties from EducationEvent assesses DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. educationalLevel DefinedTerm or Text or URL The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. teaches DefinedTerm or Text The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Properties from Event about Thing The subject matter of the content. Inverse property: subjectOf actor Person An actor, e.g. in tv, radio, movie, video games etc., or in an event. Actors can be associated with individual items or with a series, episode, clip. Supersedes actors. aggregateRating AggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. attendee Organization or Person A person or organization attending the event. Supersedes attendees. audience Audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes serviceAudience. composer Organization or Person The person or organization who wrote a composition, or who is the composer of a work performed at some event. contributor Organization or Person A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. director Person A director of e.g. tv, radio, movie, video gaming etc. content, or of an event. Directors can be associated with individual items or with a series, episode, clip.

There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An Event that is associated with a Schedule using this property should not have startDate or endDate properties. These are instead defined within the associated Schedule, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months or seasons. eventStatus EventStatusType An eventStatus of an event represents its status; particularly useful when an event is cancelled or rescheduled. funder Organization or Person A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. inLanguage Language or Text The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard. See also availableLanguage.

Supersedes free. location Place or PostalAddress or Text or VirtualLocation The location of, for example, where an event is happening, where an organization is located, or where an action takes place. maximumAttendeeCapacity Integer The total number of individuals that may attend an event or venue. maximumPhysicalAttendeeCapacity Integer The maximum physical attendee capacity of an Event whose eventAttendanceMode is OfflineEventAttendanceMode (or the offline aspects, in the case of a MixedEventAttendanceMode). maximumVirtualAttendeeCapacity Integer The maximum physical attendee capacity of an Event whose eventAttendanceMode is OnlineEventAttendanceMode (or the online aspects, in the case of a MixedEventAttendanceMode). offers Demand or Offer An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: itemOffered organizer Organization or Person An organizer of an Event. performer Organization or Person A performer at the event—for example, a presenter, musician, musical group or actor. Supersedes performers. previousStartDate Date Used in conjunction with eventStatus for rescheduled or cancelled events. This property contains the previously scheduled start date. For rescheduled events, the startDate property should be used for the newly scheduled start date. In the (rare) case of an event that has been postponed and rescheduled multiple times, this field may be repeated. recordedIn CreativeWork The CreativeWork that captured all or part of this Event. Inverse property: recordedAt remainingAttendeeCapacity Integer The number of attendee places for an event that remain unallocated. review Review A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. sponsor Organization or Person A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. startDate Date or DateTime The start date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format). subEvent Event An Event that is part of this event. For example, a conference event includes many presentations, each of which is a subEvent of the conference. Supersedes subEvents. Inverse property: superEvent superEvent Event An event that this event is a part of. For example, a collection of individual music performances might each have a music festival as their superEvent. Inverse property: subEvent translator Organization or Person Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. workFeatured CreativeWork A work featured in some event, e.g. exhibited in an ExhibitionEvent. Specific subproperties are available for workPerformed (e.g. a play), or a workPresented (a Movie at a ScreeningEvent). workPerformed CreativeWork A work performed in some event, for example a play performed in a TheaterEvent. Properties from Thing additionalType URL An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text An alias for the item. description Text A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue or Text or URL The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject or URL An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork or URL Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity name Text The name of the item. potentialAction Action Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork or Event A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about url URL URL of the item. V13.0 2021-07-07 Terms and conditions"

See How we work for more details. Welcome to Schema.org Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started!
