S.R., Thorold Resident I was never a good cook, even when I had my health, so to have Meals on Wheels delivering nourishing and tasty meals to my door is especially appreciated! B.L., Lincoln Resident I was pleasantly surprised to find the meals delicious and nourishing. The cost was nominal and the people from Meals on Wheels were exceedingly kind. Many thanks from a grateful client. W.B., Niagara Falls Resident Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Meals on Wheels for all of the support, thoughtfulness and many kindnesses.

B.L., Lincoln Resident I was pleasantly surprised to find the meals delicious and nourishing. The cost was nominal and the people from Meals on Wheels were exceedingly kind. Many thanks from a grateful client. W.B., Niagara Falls Resident Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Meals on Wheels for all of the support, thoughtfulness and many kindnesses.

A.K., Fort Erie Resident Meals on Wheels makes the world a brighter place! M.A., St. Catharines Resident I cannot say enough about Meals on Wheels. They were there for me during a long recovery from my illness. I had no appetite at all until I tasted their delicious meals. I am definitely a fan and would recommend them to anyone. S.R., Thorold Resident I was never a good cook, even when I had my health, so to have Meals on Wheels delivering nourishing and tasty meals to my door is especially appreciated! B.L., Lincoln Resident I was pleasantly surprised to find the meals delicious and nourishing. The cost was nominal and the people from Meals on Wheels were exceedingly kind. Many thanks from a grateful client. W.B., Niagara Falls Resident Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Meals on Wheels for all of the support, thoughtfulness and many kindnesses. I will never forget you. B.K., West Lincoln Resident Even on my best days, preparing meals is very difficult and shopping for groceries is out of the question.

I look forward to each visit from them. B.L., Port Colborne Resident During my convalescence, the caring people from Meals on Wheels were always there with a kind word, a smiling face and a welcome hot meal. A.K., Fort Erie Resident Meals on Wheels makes the world a brighter place! M.A., St. Catharines Resident I cannot say enough about Meals on Wheels. They were there for me during a long recovery from my illness. I had no appetite at all until I tasted their delicious meals. I am definitely a fan and would recommend them to anyone. S.R., Thorold Resident I was never a good cook, even when I had my health, so to have Meals on Wheels delivering nourishing and tasty meals to my door is especially appreciated! B.L., Lincoln Resident I was pleasantly surprised to find the meals delicious and nourishing. The cost was nominal and the people from Meals on Wheels were exceedingly kind. Many thanks from a grateful client. W.B., Niagara Falls Resident Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Meals on Wheels for all of the support, thoughtfulness and many kindnesses. I will never forget you. B.K., West Lincoln Resident Even on my best days, preparing meals is very difficult and shopping for groceries is out of the question. I always look forward to a visit from Meals on Wheels. The hot lunches are delicious and better than what many restaurants serve. S.L., Pelham Resident Contact Us We're currently offline.
