Search A global view of financial life during COVID-19 June 25, 2020 | Article By Jonathan Gordon, Ajay Gupta, Atakan Hilal , Joshua Hsu, and Olivia White Open interactive popup A global view of financial life during COVID-19 Open interactive popup As the pandemic spreads across the globe, financial decision-maker behavior and sentiment continues to shift. Most Popular Insights COVID-19: Implications for business Reimagining the office and work life after COVID-19 ‘True Gen’: Generation Z and its implications for companies Consumer sentiment is evolving as countries around the world begin to reopen From thinking about the next normal to making it work: What to stop, start, and accelerate Financial life during the COVID-19 pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has left no one untouched. While effective treatment and a vaccine remain in development, some countries have succeeded in containing the spread of COVID-19, allowing a cautious return to economic life. Even as more businesses open their doors and more people are able to return to work, life may remain indelibly changed. Sidebar Since the end of March, McKinsey has undertaken Financial Insights Pulse Surveys of household financial decision-makers across the globe to understand the impact of COVID-19 on financial well-being and on stated changes in financial services preferences. Surveys are conducted on-line in local languages and are repeated bi-weekly or monthly, depending on the region. Results are sampled on a country basis for a representative balance of financial decision makers, based on variables including age and socioeconomic status. Survey size is between 500 and 1,000 for each country in each month. To measure and anticipate the evolution in consumer financial sentiment, behaviors, needs, and expectations, we are undertaking a series of global surveys of household financial decision-makers through the crisis (first in April 2020, and again in May). The survey covers 30 countries, together accounting for 68 percent of the global population and 82 percent of all COVID-19 cases reported as of June 17 (see sidebar). We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com As of May, across the globe, decision-makers’ perceptions of the health of their national economies were negative and had grown slightly worse since April. Assessment of the current health of national economies deteriorated significantly in hard-hit Brazil and India. 1 1. A statistical note: Survey results from India were sometimes outliers, or offered contradictory views. However, reported future expectations for the next three months have improved somewhat since April across all 12 countries—most sharply in Italy, Spain, and Turkey. The survey results offer insights into how financial services providers can best serve consumers now and in the post-COVID-19 environment. Household financial decision-makers across the globe are reporting decreases in income, savings, and spending. In most countries, between 20 percent and 60 percent of decision-makers say they fear for their jobs, with roughly half of these holding four or fewer months of savings. In this environment, the support from banks most desired by customers is on credit terms—waiving late fees, reducing minimum payments, or permission to skip a loan payment. At the same time, use of cash is decreasing and digital forms of payment are increasing, perhaps as people quarantine or avoid interactions more likely to transmit disease. Against this backdrop, in most countries consumers indicate that banks are meeting their expectations—but generally not exceedingly them, at least on a net basis. The following exhibits present 10 survey observations focused on a subset of 12 countries, selected for their global and regional economic significance, and severity of the impact COVID-19 has had on their populations. Would you like to learn more about our Financial Services Practice? Visit our Risk page 1. Financial decision-maker sentiment Household financial decision-makers around the world feel their countries’ economies are weak or, at best, stuck in neutral (Exhibit 1). This feeling was most pronounced in South Africa and in hard-hit Italy, where 73 and 64 percent of respondents, respectively, assessed the economy as weak. Exhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com In China, however, where reports indicate greater progress in halting the spread of COVID-19, and the economy is edging toward more normal activity, 11 percent of decision-makers expressed a strong current view of the economy, while only 15 percent assessed it as weak. Among decision-makers in India, 16 percent reported a strong economy. As with their views on the economy, household financial decision-makers tend to assess their own personal financial situations as weak. Again, this view was most pronounced in South Africa and Italy, at 39 and 21 percent of respondents, respectively. China and the US are outliers: In both countries respondents assess their personal finances, on a net basis, as slightly positive. Notably, in all countries, respondents assess the current state of the economy more negatively than they assess their own current personal financial situations. This difference is most extreme in the UK, where net economic sentiment is 50 percentage points more negative than net sentiment about people’s own financial situations. The UK is followed by the US, Italy, and Brazil, where the differentials are 46, 44, and 42 percentage points, respectively. In China, assessments of personal financial situation are most in line with views of the economy. Between the April and May surveys, assessments of both economic strength and personal financial situations held fairly steady in most countries. However, net assessments of economic situation deteriorated by 10 percentage points or more in each of India (-24 points), Brazil (-12 points), and the United Kingdom (-10 points). In India, net assessments of personal finances dropped by 16 percentage points. We also asked decision-makers to look ahead and call the duration of the downturn (Exhibit 2). In April, more than 60 percent of respondents in the 12 countries, excluding India, expected the impact of COVID-19 to last at least a year or so. In May, this proportion rose to over 80 percent for many economies, including Western Europe and the UK. Outlooks deteriorated the most in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, and India. Exhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com When asked to project the economy and their personal financial situations three months into the future, in April respondents in most countries thought both would grow worse (Exhibit 3). India, the US, South Africa, and China were exceptions: Respondents in India envisioned both staying close to constant, while in the US and South Africa, people saw the economy improving over the next three months (by a net change of about 20 percentage points) and personal financial situations remaining relatively constant. Respondents in China predicted improvements in both the economy and their own finances. Exhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com From April to May, decision-makers in many countries grew more optimistic about how both their economies and their own personal financial situations would evolve. In Italy, Spain, and Turkey, respondents newly saw the economy turning the corner and improving over the next three months, though on balance they continued to anticipate their own financial situations would decline. Also in May, respondents in Brazil and India joined those in South Africa and China in expecting improvements in both the economy and personal financial situations. Household financial decision-makers in the UK, France, Germany, and Russia remain less optimistic for the next three months, indicating, on balance, declining expectations for both the economy and their personal financial situations. In the May survey, household financial decision-makers in the US continued to expect that the economy would grow stronger, along with a slight weakening in personal finances. 2. Consumer impact Many consumers entered the COVID-19 crisis ill-prepared for the prospect of diminished or lost income. Accordingly, we explored the impact of the pandemic on their financial behaviors and use of financial services products. To establish a baseline view of current financial strength, we asked about people’s concerns over their employment (Exhibit 4). Concern was more or less steady from April to May, although it varied widely by country: In Germany 13 percent of household financial decision-makers expressed concerns over job security, while in both India and South Africa this number was roughly 60 percent. Exhibit 4 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Within this vulnerable group, in most countries half or more held savings below four months’ worth of expenses. On a relative basis, however, decision-makers in Germany and China indicated they felt better off: In both countries, fewer than 10 percent of respondents said they feared for their jobs and had four or fewer months of savings. We have also surveyed decision-makers on their household income, savings, and spending over the past month (Exhibit 5). In May, respondents across all countries reported decreased income and savings on a net basis. The most drastic reduction was in South Africa, with 71 and 76 percent of respondents, respectively, reporting decreases. Even in China, decision-makers are still reporting reductions in household income and spending, at 50 and 43 percent respectively. Exhibit 5 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Household spending presents a more mixed picture. In South Africa again, the largest number of decision-makers reported a decrease, at 54 percent, followed closely by the UK, India, and Russia. By contrast, in each of Turkey, Brazil, and China more people reported spending increases than decreases. Since the experience of the COVID-19 lockdown is sure to alter many aspects of personal and business life, we inquired on decision-makers’ expectations of future banking patterns. Not surprisingly, consumers’ reliance on cash payments during the COVID-19 lockdown has decreased substantially in most of the representative countries (Exhibit 6). From April to May, meaningfully more customers shunned cash in South Africa, the UK, and India. For credit cards and mobile payments, shares of consumers changing their habits were mixed, while electronic payments showed stronger gains. Exhibit 6 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com We also probed a broad range of additional financial behaviors, including, for example, missed past loan payments and asset allocation plans (Exhibit 7). Rates of missed mortgage payments over the past month vary by country and region, with India and Italy reporting the highest rates at 16 and 13 percent, respectively, and Russia reporting the lowest at 1 percent. Across high-income countries, the percent of people who report having missed a mortgage payment grows roughly proportionally with the fraction of people assessing their own personal financial situations as weak. Exhibit 7 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Intent to change asset allocation over the coming three months also varies widely across countries. More consumers in India and China plan to make changes, at 70 and 46 percent, respectively, whereas fewer consumers in the EU expect to make portfolio adjustments. Across high-income countries, the fraction of people reporting plans to change asset allocation is roughly proportional to the fraction assessing the current state of economy as weak. 3. Consumer expectations of banks The survey also included questions on decision-makers’ current relationships with their banks (Exhibit 8). In most countries, a large majority—over 70 percent in most of Western Europe, for instance—indicated that their banks were at least meeting their expectations during the COVID-19 crisis. Performance above expectation was highest in Turkey and India. However, in several cases, decision-makers’ banks were not meeting expectations for a significant minority, including in Spain, Russia, France, and Italy. Exhibit 8 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com By May, assessments of bank performance had changed little, and were on the whole positive, but disappointment persisted above 20 percent in South Africa, Brazil, Spain, and Russia. When asked about how their banks could provide support during this period of uncertainty, consumers indicated a wide range of needs—creating service and support opportunities for banks (Exhibit 9). Again, opinions varied little between April and May. Customers were nearly unanimous in desiring waivers on late fees, and in a number of countries expressed a desire for reduced minimum payments, as well as forbearance on loans and mortgages (although on the last point, fewer in May than April). Higher limits on contactless payments were also in demand in Western European countries. Exhibit 9 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com In a handful of markets—Germany, Spain, and Italy—consumers are looking to their banks for an explanation of the COVID-19 crisis. In China, where mobile and digital banking are highly evolved, consumers instead requested education on their banks’ mobile and on-line tools, and 50 percent called for improvements to banks’ web sites. Similar on-line expectations were seen among about one-third of customers in the US, Turkey, and Russia. Financial decision-maker sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic: A global perspective Read the collection 4. Future outlook Looking ahead to a potential next normal, consumers expect to increase their reliance on remote banking, but with significant variation across countries (Exhibit 10). The preference was especially pronounced in South Africa, Brazil, and India as a net gain of over 30 percent of consumers indicated they will increase their use of on-line and mobile banking once “normal life” resumes. Customers in China retreated from the April survey, although a net 15 percent of people say they will increase use of on-line and mobile services. In the US and Europe, the expected shift to on-line and mobile banking services is more muted. Exhibit 10 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com In addition to the dozen countries summarized above, we have developed detailed surveys on an additional 14 countries, which also will be regularly updated. In coming months, we will conduct further surveys on the evolution of economic and financial expectations, perceptions, and behaviors of financial decision-makers all of these countries.

August 5, 2020 | Article By Margaux Constantin, Steve Saxon, and Jackey Yu Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) Reimagining the $9 trillion tourism economy—what will it take? Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) As national borders consider reopening, a partnership between governments and the tourism industry will be essential. DOWNLOADS Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) Tourism made up 10 percent of global GDP in 2019 and was worth almost $9 trillion, 1 1. See “Economic impact reports,” World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), wttc.org. making the sector nearly three times larger than agriculture. However, the tourism value chain of suppliers and intermediaries has always been fragmented, with limited coordination among the small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) that make up a large portion of the sector. Governments have generally played a limited role in the industry, with partial oversight and light-touch management. Most Popular Insights COVID-19: Implications for business ‘True Gen’: Generation Z and its implications for companies The CEO moment: Leadership for a new era The great acceleration The eight essentials of innovation COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented crisis for the tourism industry. International tourist arrivals are projected to plunge by 60 to 80 percent in 2020, and tourism spending is not likely to return to precrisis levels until 2024. This puts as many as 120 million jobs at risk. 2 2. “International tourist numbers could fall 60-80% in 2020, UNWTO reports,” World Tourism Organization, May 7, 2020, unwto.org. Reopening tourism-related businesses and managing their recovery in a way that is safe, attractive for tourists, and economically viable will require coordination at a level not seen before. The public sector may be best placed to oversee this process in the context of the fragmented SME ecosystem, large state-owned enterprises controlling entry points, and the increasing impact of health-related agencies. As borders start reopening and interest in leisure rebounds in some regions, governments could take the opportunity to rethink their role within tourism, thereby potentially both assisting in the sector’s recovery and strengthening it in the long term. In this article, we suggest four ways in which governments can reimagine their role in the tourism sector in the context of COVID-19. 1. Streamlining public–private interfaces through a tourism nerve center Before COVID-19, most tourism ministries and authorities focused on destination marketing, industry promotions, and research. Many are now dealing with a raft of new regulations, stimulus programs, and protocols. They are also dealing with uncertainty around demand forecasting, and the decisions they make around which assets—such as airports—to reopen will have a major impact on the safety of tourists and sector employees. Coordination between the public and private sectors in tourism was already complex prior to COVID-19. In the United Kingdom, for example, tourism falls within the remit of two departments—the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS)—which interact with other government agencies and the private sector at several points. Complex coordination structures often make clarity and consistency difficult. These issues are exacerbated by the degree of coordination that will be required by the tourism sector in the aftermath of the crisis, both across government agencies (for example, between the ministries responsible for transport, tourism, and health), and between the government and private-sector players (such as for implementing protocols, syncing financial aid, and reopening assets). Concentrating crucial leadership into a central nerve center is a crisis management response many organizations have deployed in similar situations. Tourism nerve centers, which bring together public, private, and semi-private players into project teams to address five themes, could provide an active collaboration framework that is particularly suited to the diverse stakeholders within the tourism sector (Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1 We analyzed stimulus packages across 24 economies, 3 3. Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. which totaled nearly $100 billion in funds dedicated directly to the tourism sector, and close to $300 billion including cross-sector packages with a heavy tourism footprint. This stimulus was generally provided by multiple entities and government departments, and few countries had a single integrated view on beneficiaries and losers. We conducted surveys on how effective the public-sector response has been and found that two-thirds of tourism players were either unaware of the measures taken by government or felt they did not have sufficient impact. Given uncertainty about the timing and speed of the tourism recovery, obtaining quick feedback and redeploying funds will be critical to ensuring that stimulus packages have maximum impact. 2. Experimenting with new financing mechanisms Most of the $100 billion stimulus that we analyzed was structured as grants, debt relief, and aid to SMEs and airlines. New Zealand has offered an NZ $15,000 (US $10,000) grant per SME to cover wages, for example, while Singapore has instituted an 8 percent cash grant on the gross monthly wages of local employees. Japan has waived the debt of small companies where income dropped more than 20 percent. In Germany, companies can use state-sponsored work-sharing schemes for up to six months, and the government provides an income replacement rate of 60 percent. Our forecasts indicate that it will take four to seven years for tourism demand to return to 2019 levels, which means that overcapacity will be the new normal in the medium term. This prolonged period of low demand means that the way tourism is financed needs to change. The aforementioned types of policies are expensive and will be difficult for governments to sustain over multiple years. They also might not go far enough. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) survey of SMEs in the tourism sector suggested more than half would not survive the next few months, and the failure of businesses on anything like this scale would put the recovery far behind even the most conservative forecasts. 4 4. See Tourism policy responses to the coronavirus (COVID-19), OECD, June 2020, oecd.org. Governments and the private sector should be investigating new, innovative financing measures. Revenue-pooling structures for hotels One option would be the creation of revenue-pooling structures, which could help asset owners and operators, especially SMEs, to manage variable costs and losses moving forward. Hotels competing for the same segment in the same district, such as a beach strip, could have an incentive to pool revenues and losses while operating at reduced capacity. Instead of having all hotels operating at 20 to 40 percent occupancy, a subset of hotels could operate at a higher occupancy rate and share the revenue with the remainder. This would allow hotels to optimize variable costs and reduce the need for government stimulus. Non-operating hotels could channel stimulus funds into refurbishments or other investment, which would boost the destination’s attractiveness. Governments will need to be the intermediary between businesses through auditing or escrow accounts in this model. Joint equity funds for small and medium-size enterprises Government-backed equity funds could also be used to deploy private capital to help ensure that tourism-related SMEs survive the crisis (Exhibit 2). This principle underpins the European Commission’s temporary framework for recapitalization of state-aided enterprises, which provided an estimated €1.9 trillion in aid to the EU economy between March and May 2020. 5 5. See “State aid: Commission expands temporary framework to recapitalisation and subordinated debt measures to further support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak,” European Commission, May 8, 2020, ec.europa.eu. Applying such a mechanism to SMEs would require creating an appropriate equity-holding structure, or securitizing equity stakes in multiple SMEs at once, reducing the overall risk profile for the investor. In addition, developing a standardized valuation methodology would avoid lengthy due diligence processes on each asset. Governments that do not have the resources to co-invest could limit their role to setting up those structures and opening them to potential private investors.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com 3. Ensuring transparent, consistent communication on protocols The return of tourism demand requires that travelers and tourism-sector employees feel—and are—safe. Although international organizations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) have developed a set of guidelines to serve as a baseline, local regulators are layering additional measures on top. This leads to low levels of harmonization regarding regulations imposed by local governments. Our surveys of traveler confidence in the United States suggests anxiety remains high, and authorities and destination managers must work to ensure travelers know about, and feel reassured by, protocols put in place for their protection. Our latest survey of traveler sentiment in China suggests a significant gap between how confident travelers would like to feel and how confident they actually feel; actual confidence in safety is much lower than the expected level asked a month before. One reason for this low level of confidence is confusion over the safety measures that are currently in place. Communication is therefore key to bolstering demand. Experience in Europe indicates that prompt, transparent, consistent communications from public agencies have had a similar impact on traveler demand as CEO announcements have on stock prices. Clear, credible announcements regarding the removal of travel restrictions have already led to increased air-travel searches and bookings. In the week that governments announced the removal of travel bans to a number of European summer destinations, for example, outbound air travel web search volumes recently exceeded precrisis levels by more than 20 percent in some countries. The case of Greece helps illustrate the importance of clear and consistent communication. Greece was one of the first EU countries to announce the date of, and conditions and protocols for, border reopening. Since that announcement, Greece’s disease incidence has remained steady and there have been no changes to the announced protocols. The result: our joint research with trivago shows that Greece is now among the top five summer destinations for German travelers for the first time. In July and August, Greece will reach inbound airline ticketing levels that are approximately 50 percent of that achieved in the same period last year. This exceeds the rate in most other European summer destinations, including Croatia (35 percent), Portugal (around 30 percent), and Spain (around 40 percent). 6 6. Based on IATA Air Travel Pulse by McKinsey. In contrast, some destinations that have had inconsistent communications around the time frame of reopening have shown net cancellations of flights for June and July. Even for the high seasons toward the end of the year, inbound air travel ticketing barely reaches 30 percent of 2019 volumes. Digital solutions can be an effective tool to bridge communication and to create consistency on protocols between governments and the private sector. In China, the health QR code system, which reflects past travel history and contact with infected people, is being widely used during the reopening stage. Travelers have to show their green, government-issued QR code before entering airports, hotels, and attractions. The code is also required for preflight check-in and, at certain destination airports, after landing. 4. Enabling a digital and analytics transformation within the tourism sector Data sources and forecasts have shifted, and proliferated, in the crisis. Last year’s demand prediction models are no longer relevant, leaving many destinations struggling to understand how demand will evolve, and therefore how to manage supply. Uncertainty over the speed and shape of the recovery means that segmentation and marketing budgets, historically reassessed every few years, now need to be updated every few months. The tourism sector needs to undergo an analytics transformation to enable the coordination of marketing budgets, sector promotions, and calendars of events, and to ensure that products are marketed to the right population segment at the right time. Governments have an opportunity to reimagine their roles in providing data infrastructure and capabilities to the tourism sector, and to investigate new and innovative operating models. This was already underway in some destinations before COVID-19. Singapore, for example, made heavy investments in its data and analytics stack over the past decade through the Singapore Tourism Analytics Network (STAN), which provided tourism players with visitor arrival statistics, passenger profiling, spending data, revenue data, and extensive customer-experience surveys. During the COVID-19 pandemic, real-time data on leading travel indicators and “nowcasts” (forecasts for the coming weeks and months) could be invaluable to inform the decisions of both public-sector and private-sector entities. This analytics transformation will also help to address the digital gap that was evident in tourism even before the crisis. Digital services are vital for travelers: in 2019, more than 40 percent of US travelers used mobile devices to book their trips. 7 7. Global Digital Traveler Research 2019, Travelport, marketing.cloud.travelport.com; “Mobile travel trends 2019 in the words of industry experts,” blog entry by David MacHale, December 11, 2018, blog.digital.travelport.com. In Europe and the United States, as many as 60 percent of travel bookings are digital, and online travel agents can have a market share as high as 50 percent, particularly for smaller independent hotels. 8 8. Sean O’Neill, “Coronavirus upheaval prompts independent hotels to look at management company startups,” Skift, May 11, 2020, skift.com. COVID-19 is likely to accelerate the shift to digital as travelers look for flexibility and booking lead times shorten: more than 90 percent of recent trips in China were booked within seven days of the trip itself. Many tourism businesses have struggled to keep pace with changing consumer preferences around digital. In particular, many tourism SMEs have not been fully able to integrate new digital capabilities in the way that larger businesses have, with barriers including language issues, and low levels of digital fluency. The commission rates on existing platforms, which range from 10 percent for larger hotel brands to 25 percent for independent hotels, also make it difficult for SMEs to compete in the digital space. Governments are well-positioned to overcome the digital gap within the sector and to level the playing field for SMEs. The Tourism Exchange Australia (TXA) platform, which was created by the Australian government, is an example of enabling at scale. It acts as a matchmaker, connecting suppliers with distributors and intermediaries to create packages attractive to a specific segment of tourists, then uses tourist engagement to provide further analytical insights to travel intermediaries (Exhibit 3). This mechanism allows online travel agents to diversify their offerings by providing more experiences away from the beaten track, which both adds to Australia’s destination attractiveness, and gives small suppliers better access to customers.

Since 2000, the value of intermediate goods traded globally has tripled to more than $10 trillion annually. Businesses that successfully implemented a lean, global model of manufacturing achieved improvements in indicators such as inventory levels, on-time-in-full deliveries, and shorter lead times. However, these operating model choices sometimes led to unintended consequences if they were not calibrated to risk exposure. Intricate production networks were designed for efficiency, cost, and proximity to markets but not necessarily for transparency or resilience. Now they are operating in a world where disruptions are regular occurrences. Averaging across industries, companies can now expect supply chain disruptions lasting a month or longer to occur every 3.7 years, and the most severe events take a major financial toll. Video Making supply chains more resilient in the post-COVID world Supply chain disruptions lasting a month or longer now happen every 3.7 years on average. The risk facing any particular industry value chain reflects its level of exposure to different types of shocks, plus the underlying vulnerabilities of a particular company or in the value chain as a whole. New research from the McKinsey Global Institute explores the rebalancing act facing many companies in goods-producing value chains as they seek to get a handle on risk—not ongoing business challenges but more profound shocks such as financial crises, terrorism, extreme weather, and, yes, pandemics. Today technology is challenging old assumptions that resilience can be purchased only at the cost of efficiency. The latest advances offer new solutions for running scenarios, monitoring many layers of supplier networks, accelerating response times, and even changing the economics of production. Some manufacturing companies will no doubt use these tools and devise other strategies to come out on the other side of the pandemic as more agile and innovative organizations. Section 1 With shocks growing more frequent and severe, industry value chains vary in their level of exposure The COVID pandemic has delivered the biggest and broadest value chain shock in recent memory. But it is only the latest in a series of disruptions. In 2011, a major earthquake and tsunami in Japan shut down factories that produce electronic components for cars, halting assembly lines worldwide. The disaster also knocked out the world’s top producer of advanced silicon wafers, on which semiconductor companies rely. Just a few months later, flooding swamped factories in Thailand that produced roughly a quarter of the world’s hard drives, leaving the makers of personal computers scrambling. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm, smashed into Texas and Louisiana. It disrupted some of the largest US oil refineries and petrochemical plants, creating shortages of key plastics and resins for a range of industries. This is more than just a run of bad luck. Changes in the environment and in the global economy are increasing the frequency and magnitude of shocks. Forty weather disasters in 2019 caused damages exceeding $1 billion each—and in recent years, the economic toll caused by the most extreme events has been escalating. 1 1. Eye of the Storm, “Earth’s 40 billion-dollar weather disasters of 2019,” Scientific American blog entry by Jeff Masters, January 22, 2020; and Matteo Coronese et al., “Evidence for sharp increase in the economic damages of extreme natural disasters,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, October 2019, Volume 116, Number 43. As a new multipolar world takes shape, we are seeing more trade disputes, higher tariffs, and broader geopolitical uncertainty. The share of global trade conducted with countries ranked in the bottom half of the world for political stability, as assessed by the World Bank, rose from 16 percent in 2000 to 29 percent in 2018. Just as telling, almost 80 percent of trade involves nations with declining political stability scores. 2 2. World Bank, Worldwide Governance Indicators 2018 (political stability and absence of violence/terrorism). Increased reliance on digital systems increases exposure to a wide variety of cyberattacks; the number of new ransomware variations alone doubled from 2018 to 2019. 3 3. Anthony Spadafora, “Ransomware mutations double in 2019,” TechRadar, August 20, 2019. Interconnected supply chains and global flows of data, finance, and people offer more “surface area” for risk to penetrate, and ripple effects can travel across these network structures rapidly. Exhibit 1 classifies different types of shocks based on their impact, lead time, and frequency of occurrence. In a few cases, we also show hypothetical shocks like a global military conflict or a systemic cyberattack that would dwarf the most severe shocks experienced to date. While these may be only remote possibilities, these scenarios are in fact studied and planned for by governments and security experts. The impact of a shock can be influenced by how long it lasts, the ripple effects it has across geographies and industries, and whether a shock hits the supply side alone or also hits demand. Exhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com This analysis reveals four broad categories of shocks. Catastrophes are historically remarkable events that cause trillions of dollars in losses. Some are foreseeable and have relatively long lead times, while others are unanticipated. Larger patterns and probabilities can guide general preparedness; hurricanes strike in the Gulf of Mexico every year, for example. But the manifestation of a specific event can strike with little to no warning. This includes some calamities that the world has avoided to date, such as a cyberattack on foundational global systems. Disruptions are serious and costly events, although on a smaller scale than catastrophes. They, too, can be split into those that telegraph their arrival in advance (such as the recent US–China trade disputes and the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union) and unanticipated events such as data breaches, product recalls, logistics disruptions, and industrial accidents. Disruptions do not cause the same cumulative economic toll as catastrophes. Companies tend to focus much of their attention on managing the types of shocks they encounter most often, which we classify as “unanticipated disruptions.” Some other shocks such as trade disputes have made headlines in recent years and, as a result, companies have started to factor them into their planning. But other types of shocks that occur less frequently could inflict bigger losses and also need to be on companies’ radar. The COVID pandemic is a reminder that outliers may be rare—but they are real possibilities that companies need to consider in their decision making. All four types of shocks can disrupt operations and supply chains, often for prolonged periods. We surveyed dozens of experts in four industries (automotive, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and computers and electronics) to understand how often they occur. Respondents report that their industries have experienced material disruptions lasting a month or longer every 3.7 years on average. Shorter disruptions happen even more frequently. We analyzed 23 industry value chains to assess their exposure to specific types of shocks. The resulting index (Exhibit 2) combines multiple factors, including how much of the industry’s current geographic footprint is found in areas prone to each type of event, the factors of production affected by those disruptions and their importance to that value chain, and other measures that increase or reduce susceptibility. Exhibit 2 Exposure to different types of shocks varies sharply by value chain. Aerospace and semiconductors, for example, are susceptible to cyberattacks and trade disputes, because of their high level of digitization, R&D, capital intensity, and exposure to digital data flows. However, both value chains have relatively low exposure to the climate-related events we have assessed here (heat stress and flooding) because of the footprint of their production. Specific types of shocks are more likely to touch certain industries. Pandemics, for example, have a major impact on labor-intensive value chains. In addition, this is the one type of shock for which we assess the effects on demand as well as supply. As we are seeing in the current crisis, demand has plummeted for nonessential goods and travel, hitting companies in apparel, petroleum products, and aerospace. By contrast, while production has been affected in value chains like agriculture and food and beverage, they have continued to see strong demand because of the essential nature of their products. In general, heat stress is more likely to strike labor-intensive value chains (and some resource-intensive value chains) because of their relatively high reliance on manual labor or outdoor work. Perhaps surprisingly, these same value chains are relatively less susceptible to trade disputes, which are increasingly focused on value chains with a high degree of knowledge intensity and high-value industries. Overall, value chains that are heavily traded relative to their output are more exposed than those with lower trade intensity. Some of these include value chains that are the most sought after by countries: communication equipment, computers and electronics, and semiconductors and components. These value chains have the further distinction of being high value and relatively concentrated, underscoring potential risks for the global economy. Heavily traded labor-intensive value chains, such as apparel, are highly exposed to pandemic risk, heat stress (because of their reliance on labor), and flood risk. In contrast, the value chains including glass and cement, food and beverage, rubber and plastics, and fabricated metals have much lower exposure to shocks; these are among the least traded and most regionally oriented value chains. All in all, the five value chains most exposed to our assessed set of six shocks collectively represent $4.4 trillion in annual exports, or roughly a quarter of global goods trade (led by petroleum products, ranked third overall, with $2.4 trillion in exports). The five least exposed value chains account for $2.6 trillion in exports. Of the five most exposed value chains, apparel accounts for the largest share of employment, with at least 25 million jobs globally, according to the International Labor Organization. 4 4. International Labor Organization, “Employment by sex and economic activity—ILO modelled estimates,” ILOSTAT, accessed June 20, 2020. Even value chains with limited exposure to all types of shocks we assessed are not immune to them. Despite recent headlines, we find that pharmaceuticals are relatively less exposed than most other industries. But the industry has been disrupted by a hurricane that struck Puerto Rico, and cyberattacks are a growing concern. In the future, the industry may be subject to greater trade tensions as well as regulatory and policy shifts if governments take action with the intent of safeguarding public health. The food and beverage industry and agriculture similarly have relatively low exposure overall, as they are globally dispersed. Yet these value chains are subject to climate-related stresses that are likely to grow over time. In addition to disrupting the lives and livelihoods of millions, this could cause the industries to become more dependent on trade or force them to undertake expensive adaptations. Section 2 Shocks exploit vulnerabilities within companies and value chains Shocks inevitably seem to exploit the weak spots within broader value chains and specific companies. An organization’s supply chain operations can be a source of vulnerability or resilience, depending on its effectiveness in monitoring risk, implementing mitigation strategies, and establishing business continuity plans. Some of these vulnerabilities are inherent to a given industry; the perishability of food and agricultural products, for example, means that the associated value chains are highly vulnerable to delivery delays and spoilage. Industries with unpredictable, seasonal, and cyclical demand also face particular challenges. Makers of electronics must adapt to relatively short product life cycles, and they cannot afford to miss spikes in consumer spending during limited holiday windows. Other vulnerabilities are the consequence of intentional decisions, such as how much inventory a company chooses to carry, the complexity of its product portfolio, the number of unique SKUs in its supply chain, and the amount of debt or insurance it carries. 5 5. SKUs are stock-keeping units, indicating a distinct type of product for sale. Changing these decisions can reduce—or increase—vulnerability to shocks. Weaknesses often stem from the structure of supplier networks in a given value chain. Complexity itself is not necessarily a weakness to the extent that it provides companies with redundancies and flexibility. But sometimes the balance can tip. Complex networks may become opaque, obscuring vulnerabilities and interdependencies. A large multinational company can have hundreds of tier-one suppliers from which it directly purchases components. Each of those tier-one suppliers in turn can rely on hundreds of tier-two suppliers. The entire supplier ecosystem associated with a large company can encompass tens of thousands of companies around the world when the deepest tiers are included. Exhibit 3 applies network analytics to illustrate the complexity of the first- and second-tier supply ecosystems for two Fortune 500 companies in the computer and electronics industry. This is based on publicly available data and may therefore not be exhaustive. 6 6. Data from the Bloomberg Supply Chain database, based on regulatory filings and other public disclosures. The database does not capture all supplier relationships, but the results provide a relative overview of connectivity and network structure compared to other companies with similar data availability. These multitiered, multinational networks span thousands of companies and extend to deeper tiers that are not shown here. This illustration also underscores the fact that even within the same industry, companies may make materially different decisions about how to structure their supply ecosystems, with implications for risk. Exhibit 3 Companies’ supplier networks vary in ways that can shape their vulnerability. Spending concentrated among just a few suppliers may make it easier to manage them, but it also heightens vulnerability should anything happen to them. Suppliers frequently supply each other; one form of structural vulnerability is a subtier supplier that accounts for relatively little in spending but is collectively important to all participants. The number of tiers of participating suppliers can hinder visibility and make it difficult to spot emergent risks. Suppliers that are dependent on a single customer can cause issues when demand shocks cascade through a value chain. The absence of substitute suppliers is another structural vulnerability. In some cases, suppliers may be concentrated in a single geography due to that country’s specialization and economies of scale. A natural disaster or localized conflict in that part of the world can cause critical shortages that snarl the entire network. Some industries, such as mobile phones and communication equipment, have become more concentrated in recent years, while others, including medical devices and aerospace, have become less so (Exhibit 4). The aerospace value chain, for example, has diversified in part due to secure market access. Exhibit 4 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Even in value chains that are generally more geographically diversified, production of certain key products may be disproportionately concentrated. Many low-value or basic ingredients in pharmaceuticals are predominantly produced in China and India, for instance. In total, we find 180 products across value chains for which one country accounts for 70 percent or more of exports, creating the potential for bottlenecks. The chemicals value chain has a particularly large number of such highly concentrated products, but examples exist in multiple industries. Other products may be produced across diverse geographies but have severe capacity constraints, which can create bottlenecks if production is halted. Geographic diversification is not inherently positive, particularly if production and sourcing expands into areas that are more exposed to shocks. Section 3 Over the course of a decade, companies can expect disruptions to erase half a year’s worth of profits or more When companies understand the magnitude of the losses they could face from supply chain disruptions, they can weigh how much to invest in mitigation. We built representative income statements and balance sheets for hypothetical companies in 13 different industries, using actual data from the 25 largest public companies in each. This enables us to see how they fare financially when under duress. We explore two scenarios involving severe and prolonged shocks: Scenario 1. A complete manufacturing shutdown lasting 100 days that affects raw material delivery and key inputs but not distribution channels and logistics. In this scenario, companies can still deliver goods to market. But once their safety stock is depleted, their revenue is hit. Scenario 2. The same as above, but in this case, distribution channels are also affected, meaning that companies cannot sell their products even if they have inventory available. Our choice to model a 100-day disruption is based on an extensive review of historical events. In 2018 alone, the five most disruptive supply chain events affected more than 2,000 sites worldwide, and factories took 22 to 29 weeks to recover. 7 7. Shahzaib Khan and Andrew Perez, Eventwatch 2018 annual report, Resilinc, 2019. Our scenarios show that a single prolonged production-only shock would wipe out between 30 and 50 percent of one year’s EBITDA for companies in most industries. An event that disrupts distribution channels as well would push the losses sharply higher for some. Industries in which companies typically hold larger inventories and have lower fixed costs tend to experience relatively smaller financial losses from shocks. If a natural disaster hits a supplier but distribution channels remain open, inventory levels become a key buffer. However, the downstream company will still face a cash drain after the fact when it is time to replenish its drawn-down safety stock. When a disruption outlasts the available safety stock, lower fixed costs become important to withstanding a decline in EBITDA. Having calculated the damage associated with one particularly severe and prolonged disruption, we then estimated the bottom-line impact that companies can expect over the course of a decade, based on probabilities. We combined the expected frequency of value chain disruptions of different lengths with the financial impact experienced by companies in different industries. On average, companies can expect losses equal to almost 45 percent of one year’s profits over the course of a decade (Exhibit 5). This is equal to seven percentage points of decline on average. We make no assessment of the extent to which the cost of these disruptions has already been priced into valuations. Exhibit 5 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com These are not distant future risks; they are current, ongoing patterns. On top of those losses, there is an additional risk of permanently losing market share to competitors that are able to sustain operations or recover faster, not to mention the cost of rebuilding damaged physical assets. However, these expected losses should be weighed in the context of the additional profits that companies are able to achieve with highly efficient and far-reaching supply chains. Section 4 Will global value chains shift across countries? Today much of the discussion about resilience in advanced economies revolves around the idea of increasing domestic production. But the highly interconnected nature of value chains limits the economic case for making large-scale changes in their physical location. Value chains often span thousands of interconnected companies, and their configurations reflect specialization, access to consumer markets around the world, long-standing relationships, and economies of scale. We set out to estimate what share of global exports could move to different countries based on the business case and how much might move due to policy interventions. To determine whether industry economics alone support a future geographic shift, we considered a number of factors. One is whether some movement is already under way. Between 2015 and 2018, for instance, the share of trade produced by the three leading export countries in apparel dropped. In contrast, the top three countries in semiconductors and mobile communications increased their share of trade markedly. Other considerations include whether the value chain is highly capital- or knowledge-intensive, or tied to geology and natural resources. All of these make relocation less feasible. Highly capital-intensive value chains are harder to move for the simple reason that they represent hundreds of billions of dollars in fixed investments. These industries have strong economies of scale, making them more costly to shift. Value chains with high knowledge intensity tend to have specialized ecosystems that have developed in specific locations, with unique suppliers and specialized talent. Deciding to move production outside of this ecosystem to a novel location is costly. Finally, value chains with comparatively high levels of extraregional trade have more scope to shorten than those that are already regionalized. We also consider overall growth, the location of major (and rising) consumer markets, trade intensity, and innovation dynamics. With respect to noneconomic factors, we consider governments’ desire to bolster national security, national competitiveness, and self-sufficiency. Some nations are focusing on safeguarding technologies with dual-use (civilian and military) implications, which could affect value chains such as semiconductors and communication equipment, particularly as 5G networks are built out. In other cases, governments are pursuing industrial policies intended to capture leading shares of emerging technologies ranging from quantum computing and artificial intelligence to renewable energy and electric vehicles. This, too, has the potential to reroute value chains. Finally, self-sufficiency has always been a question surrounding energy. Now the COVID pandemic has driven home the importance of self-sufficiency in food, pharmaceuticals, and certain medical equipment as well. We estimate that 16 to 26 percent of exports, worth $2.9 trillion to $4.6 trillion in 2018, could be in play—whether that involves reverting to domestic production, nearshoring, or new rounds of offshoring to new locations. It should be noted that this is not a forecast: it is a rough estimate of how much global trade could relocate in the next five years, not an assertion that it will actually move. The value chains with the largest share of total exports potentially in play are pharmaceuticals, apparel, and communication equipment. In dollar terms, the value chains with the largest potential to move production to new geographies are petroleum, apparel, and pharmaceuticals. 8 8. The potential to move petroleum production is of course limited by the presence of geologic deposits. But if the price of oil rises, exploration and extraction now considered uneconomic in some sites could become viable. New technologies, too, could make it possible to expand into new locations. In all of these cases, more than half of their global exports could potentially move. With few exceptions, the economic and noneconomic feasibility of geographic shifts do not overlap. Thus, countries would have to be prepared to expend considerable sums to induce shifts from what are otherwise economically optimal production footprints. In general, the economic case to move is most viable for labor-intensive value chains such as furniture, textiles, and apparel. These value chains were already experiencing shifts away from their current top producers, where the cost of labor has risen. The continuation of this trend could represent a real opportunity for some developing economies. By contrast, resource-intensive value chains, such as mining, agriculture, and energy, are generally constrained by the location of natural resources that provide crucial inputs. But policy considerations may encourage new exploration and development that can shift value chains at the margins. The value chains in the global innovations category (semiconductors, automotive, aerospace, machinery, communication, and pharmaceuticals) are subject to the most scrutiny and possible intervention from governments, based on their high value, cutting-edge technologies as well as their perceived importance for national competitiveness. But the feasibility of moving these value chains based on the economics alone is low. Production networks have begun to regionalize in recent years, and this trend may persist as growth in Asia continues to outpace global growth. But multinationals with production facilities in countries such as China, India, and other major emerging economies are typically there to serve local consumer markets, whether or not they also export from those places. As prosperity rises in these countries, they are key sources of global growth that companies will continue to pursue. Section 5 Companies have a range of options for improving resilience In a McKinsey survey of supply chain executives conducted in May 2020, an overwhelming 93 percent reported that they plan to take steps to make their supply chains more resilient, including building in redundancy across suppliers, nearshoring, reducing the number of unique parts, and regionalizing their supply chains. Strengthen supply chain risk management and improve end-to-end transparency Global manufacturing has only just begun to adopt a range of technologies such as analytics and artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, advanced robotics, and digital platforms. Companies now have access to new solutions for running scenarios, assessing trade-offs, improving transparency, accelerating responses, and even changing the economics of production. Most companies are still in the early stages of their efforts to connect the entire value chain with a seamless flow of data. Digital can deliver major benefits to efficiency and transparency that are yet to be fully realized. Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, for example, has a centralized control tower system that provides a company-wide view across geographies and products. It integrates real-time data, from inventory levels to road delays and weather forecasts, for its own plants as well as suppliers and distributors. When a problem occurs, the system can run scenarios to identify the most effective solution. 9 9. Emma Cosgrove, “How P&G created a ‘ready-for-anything’ supply chain,” Supply Chain Dive, June 3, 2019. Creating a comprehensive view of the supply chain through detailed subtier mapping is a critical step to identifying hidden relationships that invite vulnerability. Today most large firms have only a murky view beyond their tier-one and perhaps some large tier-two suppliers. Working with operations and production teams to review each product’s bill of materials can reveal whether critical inputs are sourced from high-risk areas and lack ready substitutes. Companies can also work with their tier-one suppliers to create transparency. But in cases where those suppliers lack visibility themselves or consider their own sourcing to be proprietary information, risk management teams may have to turn to other information sources to do detective work. After mapping upstream suppliers, downstream companies need to understand their production footprint, financial stability, and business continuity plans. Minimize exposure to shocks Targeted measures taken before an event occurs can mitigate the impact of a shock or speed time to recovery. As more physical assets are digitized, for example, companies will need to step up investment in cybersecurity tools and teams. One of the most important steps is building more redundancy into supplier networks. Relying on a single source for critical components or raw materials can be a vulnerability. In fact, even if a company relies on multiple suppliers, they may be concentrated in the same place. Taking the time to identify, prequalify, and onboard backup vendors comes at a cost. But it can provide much-needed capacity if a crisis strikes. Auditing and diversifying the supply chain can have the added benefit of reducing carbon intensity, raising environmental and labor standards, and expanding opportunities for women- and minority-owned businesses. One way to achieve supply chain resilience is to design products with common components, cutting down on the use of custom parts in different product offerings. Auto manufacturers are perhaps the most advanced in this regard, having implemented modular manufacturing platforms that share components across product lines and production sites. Physical assets may need to be hardened to withstand natural disasters. In regions that are vulnerable to worsening hurricanes and storm surges, this may involve installing bulkheads, elevating critical machinery and utility equipment, adding more waterproof sealing, and reworking drainage and valves. Many factories that are not air-conditioned today will need cooling systems to prepare for rising temperatures and potential heat waves in some parts of the world. Plants located in earthquake-prone areas may need seismic retrofitting. Companies can also build more redundancies into transportation and logistics. When a shock does hit, companies need the ability to respond quickly The shift to just-in-time and lean production systems has helped companies improve efficiency and reduce their need for working capital. But now they may need to strike a different balance between just-in-time and “just in case.” Having sufficient backup inventory of key parts and safety stock is a critical buffer that can minimize the financial impact of disrupted supplies. It can also position companies to meet sudden spikes in demand. The ability to reroute components and flex production dynamically across sites can keep production going in the wake of a shock. This requires robust digital systems as well as the analytics muscle to run scenarios based on different responses. When the COVID pandemic hit, Nike used predictive analytics to selectively mark down goods and reduce production early on to minimize impact. The company was also able to reroute products from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce sales, driven in part by direct-to-consumer online sales through its own training app. As a result, Nike sustained a smaller drop in sales than some of its competitors. When disaster strikes, companies have to be laser focused on cash management. But those at the top of a value chain also have a vested interest in preserving the supplier networks on which they depend. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, some companies accelerated payments or guaranteed bank loans to give key vendors a lifeline. Coming on the heels of Brexit and a flare-up in US–China trade tensions, the COVID pandemic has forced businesses to focus on building resilience in their supply chains and operations. Not everything that can go wrong actually does go wrong, but businesses and governments cannot afford to be caught flat-footed when disaster strikes. Preparing for future hypotheticals has a present-day cost. But those investments can pay off over time—not only minimizing losses but also improving digital capabilities, boosting productivity, and strengthening entire industry ecosystems. Rather than a trade-off between resilience and efficiency, this rebalancing act might deliver a win-win.

August 5, 2020 | Article By Margaux Constantin, Steve Saxon, and Jackey Yu Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) Reimagining the $9 trillion tourism economy—what will it take? Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) As national borders consider reopening, a partnership between governments and the tourism industry will be essential. DOWNLOADS Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) Tourism made up 10 percent of global GDP in 2019 and was worth almost $9 trillion, 1 1. See “Economic impact reports,” World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), wttc.org. making the sector nearly three times larger than agriculture. However, the tourism value chain of suppliers and intermediaries has always been fragmented, with limited coordination among the small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) that make up a large portion of the sector. Governments have generally played a limited role in the industry, with partial oversight and light-touch management. Most Popular Insights COVID-19: Implications for business The CEO moment: Leadership for a new era ‘True Gen’: Generation Z and its implications for companies On pins and needles: Will COVID-19 vaccines ‘save the world’? Five Fifty: The quickening COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented crisis for the tourism industry. International tourist arrivals are projected to plunge by 60 to 80 percent in 2020, and tourism spending is not likely to return to precrisis levels until 2024. This puts as many as 120 million jobs at risk. 2 2. “International tourist numbers could fall 60-80% in 2020, UNWTO reports,” World Tourism Organization, May 7, 2020, unwto.org. Reopening tourism-related businesses and managing their recovery in a way that is safe, attractive for tourists, and economically viable will require coordination at a level not seen before. The public sector may be best placed to oversee this process in the context of the fragmented SME ecosystem, large state-owned enterprises controlling entry points, and the increasing impact of health-related agencies. As borders start reopening and interest in leisure rebounds in some regions, governments could take the opportunity to rethink their role within tourism, thereby potentially both assisting in the sector’s recovery and strengthening it in the long term. In this article, we suggest four ways in which governments can reimagine their role in the tourism sector in the context of COVID-19. 1. Streamlining public–private interfaces through a tourism nerve center Before COVID-19, most tourism ministries and authorities focused on destination marketing, industry promotions, and research. Many are now dealing with a raft of new regulations, stimulus programs, and protocols. They are also dealing with uncertainty around demand forecasting, and the decisions they make around which assets—such as airports—to reopen will have a major impact on the safety of tourists and sector employees. Coordination between the public and private sectors in tourism was already complex prior to COVID-19. In the United Kingdom, for example, tourism falls within the remit of two departments—the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS)—which interact with other government agencies and the private sector at several points. Complex coordination structures often make clarity and consistency difficult. These issues are exacerbated by the degree of coordination that will be required by the tourism sector in the aftermath of the crisis, both across government agencies (for example, between the ministries responsible for transport, tourism, and health), and between the government and private-sector players (such as for implementing protocols, syncing financial aid, and reopening assets). Concentrating crucial leadership into a central nerve center is a crisis management response many organizations have deployed in similar situations. Tourism nerve centers, which bring together public, private, and semi-private players into project teams to address five themes, could provide an active collaboration framework that is particularly suited to the diverse stakeholders within the tourism sector (Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1 We analyzed stimulus packages across 24 economies, 3 3. Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. which totaled nearly $100 billion in funds dedicated directly to the tourism sector, and close to $300 billion including cross-sector packages with a heavy tourism footprint. This stimulus was generally provided by multiple entities and government departments, and few countries had a single integrated view on beneficiaries and losers. We conducted surveys on how effective the public-sector response has been and found that two-thirds of tourism players were either unaware of the measures taken by government or felt they did not have sufficient impact. Given uncertainty about the timing and speed of the tourism recovery, obtaining quick feedback and redeploying funds will be critical to ensuring that stimulus packages have maximum impact. 2. Experimenting with new financing mechanisms Most of the $100 billion stimulus that we analyzed was structured as grants, debt relief, and aid to SMEs and airlines. New Zealand has offered an NZ $15,000 (US $10,000) grant per SME to cover wages, for example, while Singapore has instituted an 8 percent cash grant on the gross monthly wages of local employees. Japan has waived the debt of small companies where income dropped more than 20 percent. In Germany, companies can use state-sponsored work-sharing schemes for up to six months, and the government provides an income replacement rate of 60 percent. Our forecasts indicate that it will take four to seven years for tourism demand to return to 2019 levels, which means that overcapacity will be the new normal in the medium term. This prolonged period of low demand means that the way tourism is financed needs to change. The aforementioned types of policies are expensive and will be difficult for governments to sustain over multiple years. They also might not go far enough. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) survey of SMEs in the tourism sector suggested more than half would not survive the next few months, and the failure of businesses on anything like this scale would put the recovery far behind even the most conservative forecasts. 4 4. See Tourism policy responses to the coronavirus (COVID-19), OECD, June 2020, oecd.org. Governments and the private sector should be investigating new, innovative financing measures. Revenue-pooling structures for hotels One option would be the creation of revenue-pooling structures, which could help asset owners and operators, especially SMEs, to manage variable costs and losses moving forward. Hotels competing for the same segment in the same district, such as a beach strip, could have an incentive to pool revenues and losses while operating at reduced capacity. Instead of having all hotels operating at 20 to 40 percent occupancy, a subset of hotels could operate at a higher occupancy rate and share the revenue with the remainder. This would allow hotels to optimize variable costs and reduce the need for government stimulus. Non-operating hotels could channel stimulus funds into refurbishments or other investment, which would boost the destination’s attractiveness. Governments will need to be the intermediary between businesses through auditing or escrow accounts in this model. Joint equity funds for small and medium-size enterprises Government-backed equity funds could also be used to deploy private capital to help ensure that tourism-related SMEs survive the crisis (Exhibit 2). This principle underpins the European Commission’s temporary framework for recapitalization of state-aided enterprises, which provided an estimated €1.9 trillion in aid to the EU economy between March and May 2020. 5 5. See “State aid: Commission expands temporary framework to recapitalisation and subordinated debt measures to further support the economy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak,” European Commission, May 8, 2020, ec.europa.eu. Applying such a mechanism to SMEs would require creating an appropriate equity-holding structure, or securitizing equity stakes in multiple SMEs at once, reducing the overall risk profile for the investor. In addition, developing a standardized valuation methodology would avoid lengthy due diligence processes on each asset. Governments that do not have the resources to co-invest could limit their role to setting up those structures and opening them to potential private investors.

Ensuring transparent, consistent communication on protocols The return of tourism demand requires that travelers and tourism-sector employees feel—and are—safe. Although international organizations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) have developed a set of guidelines to serve as a baseline, local regulators are layering additional measures on top. This leads to low levels of harmonization regarding regulations imposed by local governments. Our surveys of traveler confidence in the United States suggests anxiety remains high, and authorities and destination managers must work to ensure travelers know about, and feel reassured by, protocols put in place for their protection. Our latest survey of traveler sentiment in China suggests a significant gap between how confident travelers would like to feel and how confident they actually feel; actual confidence in safety is much lower than the expected level asked a month before. One reason for this low level of confidence is confusion over the safety measures that are currently in place. Communication is therefore key to bolstering demand. Experience in Europe indicates that prompt, transparent, consistent communications from public agencies have had a similar impact on traveler demand as CEO announcements have on stock prices. Clear, credible announcements regarding the removal of travel restrictions have already led to increased air-travel searches and bookings. In the week that governments announced the removal of travel bans to a number of European summer destinations, for example, outbound air travel web search volumes recently exceeded precrisis levels by more than 20 percent in some countries. The case of Greece helps illustrate the importance of clear and consistent communication. Greece was one of the first EU countries to announce the date of, and conditions and protocols for, border reopening. Since that announcement, Greece’s disease incidence has remained steady and there have been no changes to the announced protocols. The result: our joint research with trivago shows that Greece is now among the top five summer destinations for German travelers for the first time. In July and August, Greece will reach inbound airline ticketing levels that are approximately 50 percent of that achieved in the same period last year. This exceeds the rate in most other European summer destinations, including Croatia (35 percent), Portugal (around 30 percent), and Spain (around 40 percent). 6 6. Based on IATA Air Travel Pulse by McKinsey. In contrast, some destinations that have had inconsistent communications around the time frame of reopening have shown net cancellations of flights for June and July. Even for the high seasons toward the end of the year, inbound air travel ticketing barely reaches 30 percent of 2019 volumes. Digital solutions can be an effective tool to bridge communication and to create consistency on protocols between governments and the private sector. In China, the health QR code system, which reflects past travel history and contact with infected people, is being widely used during the reopening stage. Travelers have to show their green, government-issued QR code before entering airports, hotels, and attractions. The code is also required for preflight check-in and, at certain destination airports, after landing. 4. Enabling a digital and analytics transformation within the tourism sector Data sources and forecasts have shifted, and proliferated, in the crisis. Last year’s demand prediction models are no longer relevant, leaving many destinations struggling to understand how demand will evolve, and therefore how to manage supply. Uncertainty over the speed and shape of the recovery means that segmentation and marketing budgets, historically reassessed every few years, now need to be updated every few months. The tourism sector needs to undergo an analytics transformation to enable the coordination of marketing budgets, sector promotions, and calendars of events, and to ensure that products are marketed to the right population segment at the right time. Governments have an opportunity to reimagine their roles in providing data infrastructure and capabilities to the tourism sector, and to investigate new and innovative operating models. This was already underway in some destinations before COVID-19. Singapore, for example, made heavy investments in its data and analytics stack over the past decade through the Singapore Tourism Analytics Network (STAN), which provided tourism players with visitor arrival statistics, passenger profiling, spending data, revenue data, and extensive customer-experience surveys. During the COVID-19 pandemic, real-time data on leading travel indicators and “nowcasts” (forecasts for the coming weeks and months) could be invaluable to inform the decisions of both public-sector and private-sector entities. This analytics transformation will also help to address the digital gap that was evident in tourism even before the crisis. Digital services are vital for travelers: in 2019, more than 40 percent of US travelers used mobile devices to book their trips. 7 7.

In Europe and the United States, as many as 60 percent of travel bookings are digital, and online travel agents can have a market share as high as 50 percent, particularly for smaller independent hotels. 8 8.

COVID-19 is likely to accelerate the shift to digital as travelers look for flexibility and booking lead times shorten: more than 90 percent of recent trips in China were booked within seven days of the trip itself. Many tourism businesses have struggled to keep pace with changing consumer preferences around digital. In particular, many tourism SMEs have not been fully able to integrate new digital capabilities in the way that larger businesses have, with barriers including language issues, and low levels of digital fluency. The commission rates on existing platforms, which range from 10 percent for larger hotel brands to 25 percent for independent hotels, also make it difficult for SMEs to compete in the digital space. Governments are well-positioned to overcome the digital gap within the sector and to level the playing field for SMEs. The Tourism Exchange Australia (TXA) platform, which was created by the Australian government, is an example of enabling at scale. It acts as a matchmaker, connecting suppliers with distributors and intermediaries to create packages attractive to a specific segment of tourists, then uses tourist engagement to provide further analytical insights to travel intermediaries (Exhibit 3). This mechanism allows online travel agents to diversify their offerings by providing more experiences away from the beaten track, which both adds to Australia’s destination attractiveness, and gives small suppliers better access to customers.

By Charles Dhanaraj and George Kohlrieser Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) The hidden perils of unresolved grief Open interactive popup Article (7 pages) Chances are, there’s a hidden attendee on your team’s Zoom meetings right now—a shadowy presence that’s holding back one or more of your colleagues, fostering self-doubt, causing them to dwell on failure, barriers, and everything that can go wrong. It’s sapping their energy and leadership capacity, and could even be damaging their health, along with the health of your organization. If it’s not happening to a colleague, it might be happening to you. Most Popular Insights Reimagining the postpandemic workforce COVID-19: Implications for business The COVID-19 recovery will be digital: A plan for the first 90 days The CEO moment: Leadership for a new era Supply-chain recovery in coronavirus times—plan for now and the future This force is unresolved grief, and research suggests it costs companies billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and performance. Our own multiyear research effort finds that unresolved grief is a pervasive, overlooked leadership derailer that affects perhaps one-third of senior executives at one time or another. And these are far from ordinary times. The death, human suffering, and loss stemming from COVID-19 is unprecedented in living memory. For those who have lost loved ones, there may be no ceremonies to say final goodbyes; there is no grieving together. Moreover, the pandemic is fueling loss and grief in ways other than death and illness. Personal losses of all kinds—postponed weddings, missed graduations, painful separations from family and friends, laid off or furloughed colleagues, shuttered offices, even the cancellation of sports seasons or other valued events—can create a lingering sense of grief that harms a leader’s effectiveness and may become debilitating if unaddressed. What’s more, a host of ordinary work experiences can trigger similar emotional responses. A missed promotion, losing a key customer or client, the end of a project or the disbanding of a team, the retirement of a beloved colleague or boss, even an M&A event—these can all spark feelings of grief that include shock, anger, sadness, and fear. In this article, we draw upon research in psychology, leadership, and neuroscience—as well as our own longitudinal research—to highlight the challenges caused by unresolved grief and present approaches to help address the problem. Our hope is that more leaders will come to recognize that the painful emotions they and their colleagues may be experiencing—all of which are an inevitable part of being human—need not be debilitating or destructive; indeed, when addressed over time, these emotions can be reframed as constructive, positive, and creative elements of life, thereby helping leaders and organizations turn loss into inspiration. Understanding grief At its most basic, our experience of grief stems from our natural resistance to change. That’s why some definitions of grief usefully describe it as “the conflicting emotions brought by the change of a familiar pattern.” In our own work, we frame the discussion in terms of basic human needs—for identity, purpose, attachment, and control, among other things. When people feel the loss of one or more of these deep-seated needs (exhibit), they are experiencing grief. And the fact that these losses can stem from a variety of circumstances helps explain why feelings of grief don’t solely arise from obviously negative life events but can also be spurred by positive ones, such as moving to a new city, starting a new job, or having a baby. Exhibit We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com In our work over two decades with the International Institute for Management Development’s (IMD) High Performance Leadership program, we have long been attuned to the disruptive presence of loss and unresolved grief. This stems in part from the fact that one of us (George) saw firsthand the detrimental effects of unresolved grief when working early in his career with police officers as a hostage negotiator, where he saw how unresolved grief was a recurring trigger for hostage-taking behavior. Nonetheless, we have been continually surprised by how pervasive unresolved grief can be (affecting fully one-third of the 7,000-plus executives we’ve worked with), how likely it is that the symptoms go unnoticed or undiscussed, and how ill-equipped organizations are to handle it. The negative impact of unresolved grief is considerable. In addition to the well-known ways that stress from grief damages our physical health, 1 1. Eliana Crosina and Michael G. Pratt, “Understanding how grief weakens the body,” Atlantic, September 11, 2014, theatlantic.com. the financial cost of grief to organizations appears high: $75 billion a year for US companies, according to one study. 2 2. Research in this area is scarce, and more is needed. The figure we cite is from a 2003 study by the Grief Recovery Institute and is still widely cited today. Our goal in including it is not to encourage false precision but rather to show the sheer scope of the impact. For more, see Darlene Gavron Stevens, “The cost of grief,” Chicago Tribune, August 20, 2003, chicagotribune.com. Yet the loss of leadership capability and potential that results from unresolved grief, as well as the human suffering and pain, can seem beyond measure. The cost of grief Meet Bill, 3 3. The names of all individuals mentioned in this article have been changed to protect their privacy. an executive in his forties who, on paper, should have been a rising star in his organization. Bill wasn’t reaching his potential. He felt something was holding him back. Over time, as we became closer through working with him, Bill admitted that he was still grieving the tragic loss of his child, Karen, some 20 years before. Bill’s memories of the event remained vivid and painful: seeing her riding her bicycle down the sidewalk as he worked nearby in the garden, recognizing in a flash that she was losing control and swerving into the street, seeing the approaching car. Even two decades on, Bill’s sense of loss was gut wrenching, as was the intensity of his self-blame. “I never should have taught her to ride the bicycle,” he told us. “I’m responsible for her death.” The effect on Bill’s work life was visible in hindsight; grief affects the way leaders see the world. When we are locked in grief, our focus shifts away from possibility and positives and dwells instead on negativity and failures. Bill’s sense of helplessness was slow-burning and destructive—a cloud hanging over him. It was also subtle. At work, he was aloof and emotionally disconnected from his team; he was liked and respected, but slow to take initiative. Over the years, he had stopped applying for promotions and roles that people thought he was well-suited for. This emotional unavailability stemming from unresolved grief often makes executives live below their capacity. They may have difficulty bonding with peers or direct reports. They often prefer to play it safe. This can be true even when the loss involved isn’t the death of a loved one. The unhappiness and lack of self-respect a grieving leader feels can lead to a lack of respect for others. In some cases, the aloofness and passivity a grieving leader displays tips into coldness, coerciveness, cynicism, suspicion, and anger. This was the case for Celeste, a senior executive who had been a highly competitive Olympic-prospect athlete in her teenage years, but who had come up just short in a regional championship. The shock of this outcome, and the sense of failure, was still vivid for Celeste three decades later. “I felt like a piece of meat,” she said, recalling the moment the judges’ numbers came up. “The worst was when I looked at my coach, and then saw my father in the audience.” The sense of disappointment she saw there was the final straw. She gave up the sport, and years later wouldn’t even allow her daughters to take it up. Eventually, this sense of “playing not to lose” rather than “playing to win” spilled into her professional life as well. The unhappiness and lack of self-respect a grieving leader feels can lead to a lack of respect for others. In some cases, the aloofness and passivity a grieving leader displays tips into coldness, coerciveness, cynicism, suspicion, and anger. In the case of Ram, a business-unit leader in a large global company, the guilt and pain associated with his father’s untimely death—and the fact that Ram missed his chance to say goodbye—morphed into a dull, generalized anger that he directed against his company and its people. He subconsciously blamed work for stopping his relationship with his father. Ram had been a star, but after his father’s death he was going through the motions, failing to step up even when he was handpicked to lead an initiative by the company’s global leadership. Ram’s own leadership suffered; he was less inspiring and more withdrawn, while under the surface, he burned with resentment. Leaders often fail to recognize that they carry these burdens. Their organizations, meanwhile, are ill-equipped to manage the challenge. The focus of support for workplace grief has generally been helping colleagues after the death of an employee. Yet many sources of loss and grief don’t involve death but instead losses that feel like it. A recent study of former Lehman Brothers bankers found that after the company collapsed in 2008, many employees went through all the feelings we associate with grief. As one employee described: “I felt I lost one of my beloved . . . even though it might sound [dramatic], still, when I think about those days, I feel I was in a sort of funeral.” A CEO we know revealed the depth of his shock and feelings of loss just hours after the news that his beloved organization had been acquired, when he asked plaintively, “What do I tell my family?” He hadn’t suffered the death of a loved one, but he had lost his sense of attachment, territory, structure, and control—central aspects of his very identity. Grief is inevitable. Unresolved grief doesn’t have to be. To overcome grief, leaders must become consciously aware of the problem; accept the pain of the loss; and take actions to first let go of the past, and then to find new meaning from the experience. Resolving grief: A model Grief is an inevitable part of life, something that every leader will face sooner or later. But unresolved grief doesn’t have to be. Leaders who want to overcome grief must pass through a three-stage process: becoming consciously aware of the problem; accepting the pain of the loss; and, finally—drawing on the science of neuroplasticity—taking actions that help them let go of the past and find new meaning from the experience. We’ll now highlight these stages, note how the process helped three top executives (Ram and Bill, whom you met earlier, and Karla), and describe ways that organizations can implement this thinking. As we’ll see, some aspects of the approach are best conducted in the privacy and safety of a therapeutic environment. But developing a better understanding of grief will help every leader. Those who are suffering from unresolved grief can learn how to better identify and address it in themselves; those who aren’t will be better equipped to help their organizations manage this hidden threat. Become aware Awareness is the first step to resolving any problem, but our subconscious minds are great at keeping us safely unaware of things that might harm us emotionally. Recent research in cognitive neuroscience sheds light on the concept of “implicit memory” 4 4. Daniel L. Schacter, “Implicit memory, constructive memory, and imagining the future: A career perspective,” Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2019, Volume 14, Number 2, pp. 256–72, scholar.harvard.edu. : the influence of past experience on behavior, often without any recollection of the experience or awareness of the negative behavior. We’ve found that executives with unresolved grief are seldom able to connect the dots between their past trauma and present behavior. In Ram’s case, the grief associated with his father’s death was fresh and top of mind, as was its negative effect on his emotional state. What Ram hadn’t seen was the toll on his behavior and how much it was diminishing his ability—and indeed his willingness—to lead. For Ram, as with many executives we’ve worked with, it was this combination of connecting the dots and counting the cost of his unresolved grief that proved a breakthrough. Ram continued to resolve his grief through the stages that follow, and we saw him grow both personally and professionally. “Before,” Ram told us, “I cried every weekend [for my father] and it didn’t help. Now, I no longer [need to] cry—I feel great.” As Ram reenergized, he began engaging with people and returning to form as a leader. Eventually, Ram moved on to become the CEO of another global company. Opening up emotionally allows those who have suffered from unresolved grief to restart the process of bonding with other people. As their focus shifts outward, their internal dialogue shifts from defensive to positive. This brings calm, clarity, gratitude, and even playfulness. Accept reality Awareness reflects knowledge of reality, but acceptance requires an act of will. Many executives never get to this stage, because, frankly, it’s hard to do. The process of coming to terms with what we’ve lost means reexamining and even reliving some of the painful emotions that our subconscious minds may have been working overtime to repress. Denial is powerful. We’ve been surprised again and again to see how otherwise rational human beings persist in irrational denial. Consider Karla, a senior executive whose unresolved grief stemmed from a miscarriage. Like Ram, she was initially unable to connect the dots between her grief and her leadership—her fear of negative outcomes had made her dictatorial, unemotive, and unwilling to bond with others. She was trying to tough it out, thinking that “time heals all wounds.” But what she had really done is construct a world for herself where the miscarriage never happened. Every dinner at home even included an empty chair at the table, and Karla comforted herself with the belief that the child was present. Karla would eventually come to see how her loss could be an opportunity for learning, and over time she resolved her grief. But to do so, she had to open the lid on her repressed emotions, relive them in service of accepting reality, and understand and accept that her loss could not be filled by any other person or thing. Confronting such raw emotions can be especially challenging for senior executives. Expressing emotion means making yourself vulnerable, and leaders often resist this. They worry, understandably, that it could undercut the sense of stability they want to project to their teams. In fact, the opposite is true; leaders who demonstrate vulnerability perform better and have more loyal and engaged teams. Opening up emotionally allows those who have suffered from unresolved grief to restart the process of bonding with other people. As their focus shifts outward, their internal dialogue shifts from defensive to positive. This brings calm, clarity, gratitude, and even playfulness. With a positive focus, a leader can once again prioritize vision, goal setting, and courage; once again, he or she can inspire others to follow. It is almost like emerging from a heavy fog. As one executive put it: “I see something different now. I now recognize that grief is a problem to be solved.” Reconstruct your memory Scientific research has shown that acceptance alone doesn’t bring an end to grieving. To truly move on, an individual must find a way to create personal meaning from the loss. When we suffer a deep loss, we don’t just lose a person, a thing, a job; we also lose a set of deeply cherished dreams and visions. When Bill lost his daughter, he lost not only his child but also his dreams of seeing her grow up, thriving, having a family. Similarly, an executive who loses her job loses her vision of the future; the plans she worked so hard to design may never be implemented. The reality of a world where such dreams can’t be realized can be a frightening drain on one’s emotional energy. We may lose our worldview and even our very identity. Detaching ourselves from these dreams is a mental and emotional choice. Grief expert David Kessler’s work in repositioning grief describes this process not as an endpoint but as a prelude to profound discovery. 5 5. See David Kessler, Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief, New York, NY: Scribner, 2019. The therapeutic process by which memories can be reconstructed and reconsolidated draws on research into neuroplasticity. In principle, the process is comparable to the pioneering treatments developed in the 1990s for phantom limb pain, where mirrors are used to project a visible limb in the place of the missing one. This allows the brain to rewire itself and sort out the neurological mismatch between what a patient sees and the pain they feel. 6 6. See V. S. Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee, Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind, New York, NY: William Morrow, 1998. The parallel effort in grief resolution begins by raising the loss—and the narrative embedded in it—to one’s conscious emotional experience. We then juxtapose that narrative with a new one that directly confronts the memory with a new possibility (the “mismatch,” in this case), and repeat this multiple times to help the brain reorganize the old memory and experience it in a new way. This process helped Bill move past the loss of his daughter and the dreams he associated with her. He discovered a new sense of individual purpose by volunteering at an organization that helps children learn about gardening, an activity he’d enjoyed with his daughter. Through helping other children, Bill found new meaning that inspired him, and found a way to honor his daughter and help heal his painful memories. Professionally, Bill’s leadership capacity has grown, and he has since been promoted twice; he is widely recognized as an inspiring leader inside his organization. There is life after grief, and organizations have an important role to play in this mostly personal turnaround. Leadership teams can start by setting the right tone, recognizing grief in the organization, and creating organizational rituals that support mourning. What organizations can do As the previous examples suggest, there is life after grief—even a richer and more fulfilling life, fueled by a strengthened sense of purpose. Organizations have an important role to play in this mostly personal turnaround. Leadership teams can start to embed a spirit of awareness, acceptance, and action in the company by doing the following: Set the right tone. Leaders who open themselves to those around them inspire openness and signal an availability and warmth that draws others out. Organizations with leaders such as this are no less likely to experience the inevitability of grief, but they are far more likely to react positively and effectively when it arrives. Recognize grief in your organization. Senior executives should prompt difficult conversations about grief at times when the source of grief is obvious—and even when it’s not so obvious, such as during a strategic restructuring or an abrupt leadership transition. One of us experienced this firsthand when his manager was suddenly terminated in a terse email by a more senior executive. The organization grieved deeply; the fired manager had been with the company for two decades and was the only leader many employees there had worked with for their entire careers. After recognizing the negative effects, a senior leader convened a meeting to explain the reasons behind the move. It was a painful gathering, but it also kicked off a meaningful healing process. Create organizational rituals. Human cultures have rituals and ceremonies so that the society and the community can help grievers and their families. Organizational cultures should have their own rituals, which can send powerful signals of recovery and transformation. 7 7. Rituals are a fascinating and important area of ongoing research. For more, see Nicholas M. Hobson, Devin Bonk, and Michael Inzlicht, “Rituals decrease the neural response to performance failure,” PeerJ, May 30, 2017, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Japanese organizations are known for their rituals when there are senior-leadership transitions, 8 8. For example, see Hirochika Nakamaki, “Memorial monuments and memorial services of Japanese companies: Focusing on Mount Koya,” in Ceremony and Ritual in Japan: Religious Practices in an Industrialized Society, London, UK: Routledge, 1995, pp. 25–37. giving ample space and time for the organization to recognize the past and move into the future. “Failure wakes” and other such rituals help staffers get over failed experiments by celebrating their boldness with food, drinks, and reflections on what was learned. These rituals are anything but superfluous. Instead, they help people move on from grief. Unresolved grief is a quietly destructive force that derails leaders and hurts organizations during the best of times. And these aren’t the best of times. By recognizing the ways the pandemic is fueling grief and loss, leaders and organizations alike can take steps to transform grief into a creative force that turns loss into inspiration.

Personal losses of all kinds—postponed weddings, missed graduations, painful separations from family and friends, laid off or furloughed colleagues, shuttered offices, even the cancellation of sports seasons or other valued events—can create a lingering sense of grief that harms a leader’s effectiveness and may become debilitating if unaddressed. What’s more, a host of ordinary work experiences can trigger similar emotional responses. A missed promotion, losing a key customer or client, the end of a project or the disbanding of a team, the retirement of a beloved colleague or boss, even an M&A event—these can all spark feelings of grief that include shock, anger, sadness, and fear. In this article, we draw upon research in psychology, leadership, and neuroscience—as well as our own longitudinal research—to highlight the challenges caused by unresolved grief and present approaches to help address the problem. Our hope is that more leaders will come to recognize that the painful emotions they and their colleagues may be experiencing—all of which are an inevitable part of being human—need not be debilitating or destructive; indeed, when addressed over time, these emotions can be reframed as constructive, positive, and creative elements of life, thereby helping leaders and organizations turn loss into inspiration. Understanding grief At its most basic, our experience of grief stems from our natural resistance to change. That’s why some definitions of grief usefully describe it as “the conflicting emotions brought by the change of a familiar pattern.” In our own work, we frame the discussion in terms of basic human needs—for identity, purpose, attachment, and control, among other things. When people feel the loss of one or more of these deep-seated needs (exhibit), they are experiencing grief. And the fact that these losses can stem from a variety of circumstances helps explain why feelings of grief don’t solely arise from obviously negative life events but can also be spurred by positive ones, such as moving to a new city, starting a new job, or having a baby.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com In our work over two decades with the International Institute for Management Development’s (IMD) High Performance Leadership program, we have long been attuned to the disruptive presence of loss and unresolved grief. This stems in part from the fact that one of us (George) saw firsthand the detrimental effects of unresolved grief when working early in his career with police officers as a hostage negotiator, where he saw how unresolved grief was a recurring trigger for hostage-taking behavior. Nonetheless, we have been continually surprised by how pervasive unresolved grief can be (affecting fully one-third of the 7,000-plus executives we’ve worked with), how likely it is that the symptoms go unnoticed or undiscussed, and how ill-equipped organizations are to handle it. The negative impact of unresolved grief is considerable. In addition to the well-known ways that stress from grief damages our physical health, 1 1. Eliana Crosina and Michael G. Pratt, “Understanding how grief weakens the body,” Atlantic, September 11, 2014, theatlantic.com. the financial cost of grief to organizations appears high: $75 billion a year for US companies, according to one study. 2 2. Research in this area is scarce, and more is needed. The figure we cite is from a 2003 study by the Grief Recovery Institute and is still widely cited today. Our goal in including it is not to encourage false precision but rather to show the sheer scope of the impact. For more, see Darlene Gavron Stevens, “The cost of grief,” Chicago Tribune, August 20, 2003, chicagotribune.com. Yet the loss of leadership capability and potential that results from unresolved grief, as well as the human suffering and pain, can seem beyond measure. The cost of grief Meet Bill, 3 3. The names of all individuals mentioned in this article have been changed to protect their privacy. an executive in his forties who, on paper, should have been a rising star in his organization. Bill wasn’t reaching his potential. He felt something was holding him back. Over time, as we became closer through working with him, Bill admitted that he was still grieving the tragic loss of his child, Karen, some 20 years before. Bill’s memories of the event remained vivid and painful: seeing her riding her bicycle down the sidewalk as he worked nearby in the garden, recognizing in a flash that she was losing control and swerving into the street, seeing the approaching car. Even two decades on, Bill’s sense of loss was gut wrenching, as was the intensity of his self-blame. “I never should have taught her to ride the bicycle,” he told us. “I’m responsible for her death.” The effect on Bill’s work life was visible in hindsight; grief affects the way leaders see the world. When we are locked in grief, our focus shifts away from possibility and positives and dwells instead on negativity and failures. Bill’s sense of helplessness was slow-burning and destructive—a cloud hanging over him. It was also subtle. At work, he was aloof and emotionally disconnected from his team; he was liked and respected, but slow to take initiative. Over the years, he had stopped applying for promotions and roles that people thought he was well-suited for. This emotional unavailability stemming from unresolved grief often makes executives live below their capacity. They may have difficulty bonding with peers or direct reports. They often prefer to play it safe. This can be true even when the loss involved isn’t the death of a loved one. The unhappiness and lack of self-respect a grieving leader feels can lead to a lack of respect for others. In some cases, the aloofness and passivity a grieving leader displays tips into coldness, coerciveness, cynicism, suspicion, and anger. This was the case for Celeste, a senior executive who had been a highly competitive Olympic-prospect athlete in her teenage years, but who had come up just short in a regional championship. The shock of this outcome, and the sense of failure, was still vivid for Celeste three decades later. “I felt like a piece of meat,” she said, recalling the moment the judges’ numbers came up. “The worst was when I looked at my coach, and then saw my father in the audience.” The sense of disappointment she saw there was the final straw. She gave up the sport, and years later wouldn’t even allow her daughters to take it up. Eventually, this sense of “playing not to lose” rather than “playing to win” spilled into her professional life as well. The unhappiness and lack of self-respect a grieving leader feels can lead to a lack of respect for others. In some cases, the aloofness and passivity a grieving leader displays tips into coldness, coerciveness, cynicism, suspicion, and anger. In the case of Ram, a business-unit leader in a large global company, the guilt and pain associated with his father’s untimely death—and the fact that Ram missed his chance to say goodbye—morphed into a dull, generalized anger that he directed against his company and its people. He subconsciously blamed work for stopping his relationship with his father. Ram had been a star, but after his father’s death he was going through the motions, failing to step up even when he was handpicked to lead an initiative by the company’s global leadership. Ram’s own leadership suffered; he was less inspiring and more withdrawn, while under the surface, he burned with resentment. Leaders often fail to recognize that they carry these burdens. Their organizations, meanwhile, are ill-equipped to manage the challenge. The focus of support for workplace grief has generally been helping colleagues after the death of an employee. Yet many sources of loss and grief don’t involve death but instead losses that feel like it. A recent study of former Lehman Brothers bankers found that after the company collapsed in 2008, many employees went through all the feelings we associate with grief. As one employee described: “I felt I lost one of my beloved . . . even though it might sound [dramatic], still, when I think about those days, I feel I was in a sort of funeral.” A CEO we know revealed the depth of his shock and feelings of loss just hours after the news that his beloved organization had been acquired, when he asked plaintively, “What do I tell my family?” He hadn’t suffered the death of a loved one, but he had lost his sense of attachment, territory, structure, and control—central aspects of his very identity. Grief is inevitable. Unresolved grief doesn’t have to be. To overcome grief, leaders must become consciously aware of the problem; accept the pain of the loss; and take actions to first let go of the past, and then to find new meaning from the experience. Resolving grief: A model Grief is an inevitable part of life, something that every leader will face sooner or later. But unresolved grief doesn’t have to be. Leaders who want to overcome grief must pass through a three-stage process: becoming consciously aware of the problem; accepting the pain of the loss; and, finally—drawing on the science of neuroplasticity—taking actions that help them let go of the past and find new meaning from the experience. We’ll now highlight these stages, note how the process helped three top executives (Ram and Bill, whom you met earlier, and Karla), and describe ways that organizations can implement this thinking. As we’ll see, some aspects of the approach are best conducted in the privacy and safety of a therapeutic environment. But developing a better understanding of grief will help every leader. Those who are suffering from unresolved grief can learn how to better identify and address it in themselves; those who aren’t will be better equipped to help their organizations manage this hidden threat. Become aware Awareness is the first step to resolving any problem, but our subconscious minds are great at keeping us safely unaware of things that might harm us emotionally. Recent research in cognitive neuroscience sheds light on the concept of “implicit memory” 4 4. Daniel L. Schacter, “Implicit memory, constructive memory, and imagining the future: A career perspective,” Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2019, Volume 14, Number 2, pp. 256–72, scholar.harvard.edu. : the influence of past experience on behavior, often without any recollection of the experience or awareness of the negative behavior. We’ve found that executives with unresolved grief are seldom able to connect the dots between their past trauma and present behavior. In Ram’s case, the grief associated with his father’s death was fresh and top of mind, as was its negative effect on his emotional state. What Ram hadn’t seen was the toll on his behavior and how much it was diminishing his ability—and indeed his willingness—to lead. For Ram, as with many executives we’ve worked with, it was this combination of connecting the dots and counting the cost of his unresolved grief that proved a breakthrough. Ram continued to resolve his grief through the stages that follow, and we saw him grow both personally and professionally. “Before,” Ram told us, “I cried every weekend [for my father] and it didn’t help. Now, I no longer [need to] cry—I feel great.” As Ram reenergized, he began engaging with people and returning to form as a leader. Eventually, Ram moved on to become the CEO of another global company. Opening up emotionally allows those who have suffered from unresolved grief to restart the process of bonding with other people. As their focus shifts outward, their internal dialogue shifts from defensive to positive. This brings calm, clarity, gratitude, and even playfulness. Accept reality Awareness reflects knowledge of reality, but acceptance requires an act of will. Many executives never get to this stage, because, frankly, it’s hard to do. The process of coming to terms with what we’ve lost means reexamining and even reliving some of the painful emotions that our subconscious minds may have been working overtime to repress. Denial is powerful. We’ve been surprised again and again to see how otherwise rational human beings persist in irrational denial. Consider Karla, a senior executive whose unresolved grief stemmed from a miscarriage. Like Ram, she was initially unable to connect the dots between her grief and her leadership—her fear of negative outcomes had made her dictatorial, unemotive, and unwilling to bond with others. She was trying to tough it out, thinking that “time heals all wounds.” But what she had really done is construct a world for herself where the miscarriage never happened. Every dinner at home even included an empty chair at the table, and Karla comforted herself with the belief that the child was present. Karla would eventually come to see how her loss could be an opportunity for learning, and over time she resolved her grief. But to do so, she had to open the lid on her repressed emotions, relive them in service of accepting reality, and understand and accept that her loss could not be filled by any other person or thing. Confronting such raw emotions can be especially challenging for senior executives. Expressing emotion means making yourself vulnerable, and leaders often resist this. They worry, understandably, that it could undercut the sense of stability they want to project to their teams. In fact, the opposite is true; leaders who demonstrate vulnerability perform better and have more loyal and engaged teams. Opening up emotionally allows those who have suffered from unresolved grief to restart the process of bonding with other people. As their focus shifts outward, their internal dialogue shifts from defensive to positive. This brings calm, clarity, gratitude, and even playfulness. With a positive focus, a leader can once again prioritize vision, goal setting, and courage; once again, he or she can inspire others to follow. It is almost like emerging from a heavy fog. As one executive put it: “I see something different now. I now recognize that grief is a problem to be solved.” Reconstruct your memory Scientific research has shown that acceptance alone doesn’t bring an end to grieving. To truly move on, an individual must find a way to create personal meaning from the loss. When we suffer a deep loss, we don’t just lose a person, a thing, a job; we also lose a set of deeply cherished dreams and visions. When Bill lost his daughter, he lost not only his child but also his dreams of seeing her grow up, thriving, having a family. Similarly, an executive who loses her job loses her vision of the future; the plans she worked so hard to design may never be implemented. The reality of a world where such dreams can’t be realized can be a frightening drain on one’s emotional energy. We may lose our worldview and even our very identity. Detaching ourselves from these dreams is a mental and emotional choice. Grief expert David Kessler’s work in repositioning grief describes this process not as an endpoint but as a prelude to profound discovery. 5 5. See David Kessler, Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief, New York, NY: Scribner, 2019. The therapeutic process by which memories can be reconstructed and reconsolidated draws on research into neuroplasticity. In principle, the process is comparable to the pioneering treatments developed in the 1990s for phantom limb pain, where mirrors are used to project a visible limb in the place of the missing one. This allows the brain to rewire itself and sort out the neurological mismatch between what a patient sees and the pain they feel. 6 6. See V. S. Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee, Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind, New York, NY: William Morrow, 1998. The parallel effort in grief resolution begins by raising the loss—and the narrative embedded in it—to one’s conscious emotional experience. We then juxtapose that narrative with a new one that directly confronts the memory with a new possibility (the “mismatch,” in this case), and repeat this multiple times to help the brain reorganize the old memory and experience it in a new way. This process helped Bill move past the loss of his daughter and the dreams he associated with her. He discovered a new sense of individual purpose by volunteering at an organization that helps children learn about gardening, an activity he’d enjoyed with his daughter. Through helping other children, Bill found new meaning that inspired him, and found a way to honor his daughter and help heal his painful memories. Professionally, Bill’s leadership capacity has grown, and he has since been promoted twice; he is widely recognized as an inspiring leader inside his organization. There is life after grief, and organizations have an important role to play in this mostly personal turnaround. Leadership teams can start by setting the right tone, recognizing grief in the organization, and creating organizational rituals that support mourning. What organizations can do As the previous examples suggest, there is life after grief—even a richer and more fulfilling life, fueled by a strengthened sense of purpose. Organizations have an important role to play in this mostly personal turnaround. Leadership teams can start to embed a spirit of awareness, acceptance, and action in the company by doing the following: Set the right tone. Leaders who open themselves to those around them inspire openness and signal an availability and warmth that draws others out. Organizations with leaders such as this are no less likely to experience the inevitability of grief, but they are far more likely to react positively and effectively when it arrives. Recognize grief in your organization. Senior executives should prompt difficult conversations about grief at times when the source of grief is obvious—and even when it’s not so obvious, such as during a strategic restructuring or an abrupt leadership transition. One of us experienced this firsthand when his manager was suddenly terminated in a terse email by a more senior executive. The organization grieved deeply; the fired manager had been with the company for two decades and was the only leader many employees there had worked with for their entire careers. After recognizing the negative effects, a senior leader convened a meeting to explain the reasons behind the move. It was a painful gathering, but it also kicked off a meaningful healing process. Create organizational rituals. Human cultures have rituals and ceremonies so that the society and the community can help grievers and their families. Organizational cultures should have their own rituals, which can send powerful signals of recovery and transformation. 7 7. Rituals are a fascinating and important area of ongoing research. For more, see Nicholas M. Hobson, Devin Bonk, and Michael Inzlicht, “Rituals decrease the neural response to performance failure,” PeerJ, May 30, 2017, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Japanese organizations are known for their rituals when there are senior-leadership transitions, 8 8. For example, see Hirochika Nakamaki, “Memorial monuments and memorial services of Japanese companies: Focusing on Mount Koya,” in Ceremony and Ritual in Japan: Religious Practices in an Industrialized Society, London, UK: Routledge, 1995, pp. 25–37. giving ample space and time for the organization to recognize the past and move into the future. “Failure wakes” and other such rituals help staffers get over failed experiments by celebrating their boldness with food, drinks, and reflections on what was learned. These rituals are anything but superfluous. Instead, they help people move on from grief. Unresolved grief is a quietly destructive force that derails leaders and hurts organizations during the best of times. And these aren’t the best of times. By recognizing the ways the pandemic is fueling grief and loss, leaders and organizations alike can take steps to transform grief into a creative force that turns loss into inspiration.

DOWNLOADS Open interactive popup Article (15 pages) European start-ups are being created and growing at an unprecedented pace these days, attracting the attention of global investors, customers, and corporate partners alike. In the process, they are proving the conventional wisdom wrong: launching a start-up amid the continent’s fragmented value pool doesn’t necessarily have to be such a challenging proposition. Sidebar About the authors This article was a collaborative effort by Kim Baroudy, Philipp Handel, Anne Hürxkens, Bouke Marsman, Tobias Strålin, and Jaap Vriesendorp, representing views from McKinsey’s Technology, Media & Telecommunications Practice. Despite the range of systemic challenges start-ups still face, including regulatory and cultural challenges, growing numbers of dynamic new ventures are thriving. These bold players offer valuable lessons for others aspiring to similar heights—and to a European continent striving to stay economically and technologically competitive with the rest of the world. To better understand how these standouts succeed, we studied the top 1,000 European tech start-ups founded after 2000 in 33 countries, which include 21st-century companies such as Spotify, Adyen, and BioNTech. We analyzed them along 15 critical growth dimensions and variables such as geography and vertical, as well as on the requirements for the time, funding, and revenues it takes to reach unicorn status (see Exhibits 1 and 2; also see the sidebar, “About our research”). Three key insights emerged from our analysis: Successful European tech start-ups follow one of four distinct roads to success: network, scale, product, or deep tech, each with its own characteristics regarding revenue growth, employees, and other similar markers. Different strategic plays require different success factors, such as overindexing on commercial roles for scale players, focusing on an initial product hook for product players, or pursuing M&A activities for scale and network players. Reaching unicorn status requires on average €100 million to €200 million in funding, with 70 to 80 percent of the companies that make it achieving the €1 billion valuation mark within ten years of founding.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Four winning strategic plays Our research on the top 1,000 European tech start-ups showed that these companies follow one of a small number of distinct paths to successful scaling, built around a core strategic approach: network, scale, product, or deep tech. While these categories are not mutually exclusive, each of them provides a path to scale. We believe this classification provides practical utility for entrepreneurs, executives, and investors as they launch and attempt to scale ventures (Exhibit 3). Exhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com By assessing themselves with regard to these strategic plays, European start-ups and scale-ups (and their investors) can spend less time and effort trying to figure out what they do best or how to do it on a wider stage and instead make better, faster decisions and focus resources for the greatest effect. Yet, knowing what strategic approach to embrace is only part of the equation. It is also critical to know what tactical moves tend to lead to success for each of the different strategic plays (Exhibit 4). Exhibit 4 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Our analysis suggests a range of five such critical factors are at work. For network players, it’s crucial to win local markets one by one and not try to grow globally in one fell swoop. Scale plays need to overindex on building strong commercial capabilities. Both network and scale players benefit from M&A. Product-play companies need to prioritize a compelling product and narrow use case initially, while for deep-tech plays, attracting the best research and development talent is most important. Winning markets one by one: Network plays Sidebar About our research To identify European tech champions, we selected a sample of 1,000 tech companies founded after the year 2000, based on their valuations. Our sample includes companies from 33 European countries; among them, the United Kingdom is home to the most start-ups, with one-third of the sample, followed by Germany and France. The companies in our sample cover nine verticals: AI, B2B software as a service (SaaS), biotech and healthcare, e-commerce and consumer, fintech, IT hardware, marketplace, media and content, and mobility. Approximately 60 percent of the start-ups come from biotech, B2B SaaS, and fintech. We developed our data set in February 2021 from our proprietary integrated database that leverages sources such as Crunchbase, PitchBook, Dealroom, LinkedIn, and S&P Capital IQ. We then assessed these companies against the following 15 critical capabilities for scaling: Business model, which includes innovativeness and total market size Tailwind, which includes macro trends in favor of business Growth, which includes revenue growth rates from organic growth as well as from M&A activities Internationalization, which includes presence in and preparedness to enter foreign markets Speed of expansion, which includes the effectiveness of the sales force and marketing teams to address new segments rapidly R&D intensity, which includes the ability to innovate continuously and develop defensible competitive moats (intellectual property, for example) Offering, which includes the strength and maturity of the value proposition for the customer/user Tech architecture, which includes the agility of the front and back ends and data availability Scalability of operations, which includes efficiency of operational scale-up, including speed of processes and decision making Value creation, which includes the ability to leverage the ecosystem for partnerships, including partner management Founding team, which includes the mindset, educational and professional background, and role of founders Human resources, which includes attractiveness to top talent and retention Culture, which includes readiness of the organization for rapid growth (culture is learning-oriented and data-driven) Funding, which includes amount, sufficiency, and source Exit strategy, which includes readiness for IPO or sale We then performed a quantitative analysis to validate our findings and a statistical analysis. To confirm the strategic plays, we applied feature-selection techniques to define the key drivers for the different strategic plays, which resulted in 11 variables. 1 1. The variables we used are as follows: vertical; number of countries with office presence; number of employees; relative number of acquisitions per year; revenues; relative valuation growth per year; relative funding growth per year; share of roles (commercial, operational, product/tech); share of employees from top 100 universities; patents granted; and trademarks registered. Cluster-validation techniques were applied using these variables to compare how similar a company is to its own cluster and to other clusters. This results in a silhouette score ranging between –1 and +1, which is a measure of how well a company fits into its strategic play. A positive silhouette score indicates that a company is well matched to its play and poorly matched to neighboring plays. Each of the plays has a positive silhouette score, with a mean of +0.14 for the full sample: Network-play silhouette score = +0.07 Scale-play silhouette score = +0.09 Product-play silhouette score = +0.15 Deep-tech-play silhouette score = +0.19 Finally, a deep-learning algorithm was applied to reduce dimensionality and enable visualization of the strategic plays for the companies we analyzed. 2 2. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. To confirm the statistical significance of the success criteria, we conducted a regression analysis 3 3. Logistic regression. to determine the p-value. A p-value gives a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. A p-value smaller than 0.05 (p < 0.05) is statistically significant and a p-value smaller than 0.001 (p < 0.001) is highly significant. The latter means that our findings have less than a one-in-a-thousand chance of being random. Where possible, we determined the p-value for the different success criteria: Network and scale plays—expanding and consolidating with M&A: p-value < 0.001 Scale plays—overindexing on commercial roles: p-value = 0.063 Product plays: not applicable (small sample size) Deep-tech plays—winning with top research talent: p-value < 0.001 As is often the case in other parts of the world, network effects can be global or local. The network effects in the sharing economy happen on a city and even neighborhood level, while the network effects from social-media companies are often more global. For example, brokerages can harness network effects across geographies, while businesses in the sharing economy or other locally-consumed services can benefit at the local level. Among the companies we studied, those that successfully pursue a network play make a trade-off between being right and being fast: they need to expand internationally to grow, but they first need to focus enough effort on individual markets to become the dominant local platform. Most Popular Insights Defining the skills citizens will need in the future world of work Back to the future? Airline sector poised for change post-COVID-19 COVID-19: Implications for business It’s time for leaders to get real about hybrid These types of companies tend to be marketplace, mobility, and social-media start-ups, such as Delivery Hero (online food delivery) and Tier (micromobility). They require an addressable market that is concentrated in a relatively small geographical area such as a city—a “hyperlocal” market. Because languages, cultures, and governments vary so widely among European cities, successful network-play start-ups enter these markets one by one, adapting their go-to-market strategy as they proceed, rather than all at once with a global approach as might be possible in a region with more uniform characteristics between cities. This effect of winning market by market is visible in the experiences of shared e-scooter players, which operate in cities where there is really only room for a few competitors, and first movers do not always win. In numerous European cities, local competitors Tier and Voi have taken the lead over Lime despite its early start (Exhibit 5). For example, in Berlin, Lime was able to provide the largest e-scooter fleet when entering the market in 2019, with its unmatched global scale. A year later, however, Tier is leading the key market with an estimated share (based on Google search interest) of 34 percent, beating Lime (28 percent). So, adapting go-to-market strategies to each new city is critical not only to winning at the outset but also to maintaining a winning position. For its part, Tier has found success by winning contracts with local governments and other local public-transport companies to offer e-scooter services. Exhibit 5 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com That focus can still be costly. To subsidize early usage across a local market, network-focused companies require the highest funding of all plays, with an average funding since founding of €243 million compared with €164 million for all of the top 1,000 companies we analyzed. Overindexing on commercial roles: Scale plays Start-ups pursuing scale plays seek to win through rapid sales growth early on, relying on initial commercial success to create the economies of scale they need to dominate a market. To achieve this early commercial success, outperforming scale start-ups invest more heavily in sales, marketing, and business-development roles. On average, these positions account for 42 percent of all employees, compared with about 33 percent for the other strategic plays. To support sales, they have a stronger focus on operational roles (17 percent) compared with product (9 percent) and deep-tech plays (14 percent). Overall, successful scale players tend to have the most employees—almost twice as many as product players and even three times as many as successful deep-tech players (Exhibit 6). At the same time, scale players typically focus less on product roles (28 percent) compared with about 40 percent for the other strategic plays. This is a reflection of the fact that success is generally achieved more through sales than through product differentiation. Exhibit 6 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com The companies that pursue this play are frequently e-commerce, consumer, or media companies, such as Spotify (music and other audio) and Zalando (fashion and lifestyle). This is confirmed in scale-play companies’ average revenue since founding, which is the highest with €826 million compared with €277 million for companies in the top 1,000 companies we analyzed. As scale companies mature, the relative size of their commercial functions decreases, resulting in the increased importance of other roles, particularly product and tech roles. In our sample of start-ups that are less than five years old, the share of commercial functions is 43 percent on average, which drops to 39 percent for start-ups that are six to ten years old, and 34 percent for older start-ups. A closer look at five of the most valuable European scale players (Farfetch, HelloFresh, Spotify, The Hut Group, and Zalando) shows this transition into product and tech roles: having matured to a degree, these scale players now have about 35 percent of their employees in commercial positions. Expanding and consolidating with M&A: Network and scale plays Companies pursuing either a network play or a scale play often rely more heavily on M&A to expand into new regions and consolidate markets, rather than launching in new markets on their own. This approach is especially effective for European start-ups, which need to enter more markets in more countries to attain an addressable market that is sizeable enough. Network- and scale-play start-ups conduct between 1.6 and 1.9 deals across all funding rounds, which is twice as many as the average in our sample (Exhibit 7). By contrast, M&A activity among ventures pursuing a product play is below the average across the group, at 0.7 deals, and most start-ups going for a deep-tech play are unlikely to engage in M&A at all. Exhibit 7 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com M&A provides the opportunity to accelerate growth and can entail arbitrage effects when a large successful start-up acquires a smaller start-up valued at a lower multiple. On the other hand, heavy M&A activity can turn out to be a costly distraction, especially for early-stage start-ups, effectively slowing their organic growth. In deciding how intensively to pursue M&A, the start-ups we studied consider organizational capacity and resources to integrate the acquired company. Starting with a stellar offering and a narrow use case: Product plays Successful product players start with an outstanding product in a narrow use case before moving to a full-suite offering. Getting the product (and market fit) right early on is more important to these kinds of start-ups, and so their product and tech roles—R&D, engineering, product management, and IT, for example—have greater importance. At the same time, their focus on commercial and operational roles is much lower than for the other strategic plays. Product players are usually B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers or fintechs such as Personio (HR software) and N26 (neobanking). We found that product players require the least amount of funding, with €145 million in funding compared with €164 million on average for all of the companies we analyzed. They are also dominant in Europe, occupying about 45 percent of the region’s top 1,000 tech start-ups. These companies’ emphasis on product excellence is also visible in Apple App Store ratings. Among a subset of companies whose apps are critical to the product experience, almost 35 percent of product-play companies have developed a top-rated app, as compared with an average of around 30 percent for other plays. Product quality is also more closely associated with growth for product plays—product-play companies with an outstanding App Store rating grow 27 percent faster than their counterparts with lower-rated apps. 1 1. We defined growth as addition of full-time-equivalent employees. With relatively limited resources initially, product-play start-ups focus intensely on both reaching adoption fast and providing a strong customer experience. To help achieve this, they often develop their initial product for a select, well-defined use case. This drives early usage as well as the collection of detailed customer feedback, which is essential for further product development and scaling-up to a larger customer base. For example, N26, the German neobank, focused on adoption early, offering only basic banking products such as current accounts and credit cards. Only later did the company expand its offering to adjacent categories. After attaining scale, it subsequently moved to higher-margin products, such as lending and investing. At that point, N26 was ready to explore partnerships with other fintechs, which helped to open up cross-sell opportunities. Winning with top research talent: Deep-tech plays Deep-tech players tend to work on AI, hardware, biotech, or healthcare, and so they focus longer and more intensively on exploratory research and development than companies pursuing other strategic plays. Lilium (electric air-mobility service) and Graphcore (accelerators for AI and machine learning) are examples. The companies in this group are characterized by a relatively low number of employees, with 211 employees on average, as compared with an average of 488 employees for the companies we analyzed. As expected, they have the highest (46 percent) share of employees in R&D roles; by comparison, product-play companies have 38 percent of employees in such roles, and the percentage is closer to 30 and 28 percent for network and scale plays, respectively. As a result, they receive on average 1.87 patents per year, significantly higher than product-play companies (0.19 patents per year), scale-play companies (0.21 patents per year), and network-play companies (0 patents per year). One important way leading deep-tech start-ups separate themselves from the rest of the pack is by hiring the top research talent in Europe. On average, 27 percent of their hires come from the top 100 international universities, which is 51 percent above the average in our sample group (Exhibit 8). 2 2. As defined in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) 2020; “2020 Academic Ranking of World Universities,” ShanghaiRanking Consultancy, August 2020, shanghairanking.com. Valuations also correlate to the quantity and caliber of the R&D team. In comparing deep-tech companies with similar funding, those with a higher share of top-tier researchers achieve 43 percent higher valuations than others (Exhibit 9).

If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Companies pursuing a deep-tech play require more extensive funding long before they become winners. As such, they need investors that have a similar long-term vision and willingness to fund a long R&D phase. For example, Lilium, which is developing vertical take-off and landing personal aircraft, has managed to attract large investment years before reaching commercialization. What it takes to build a European tech unicorn In our analysis of the most successful European tech start-ups, we looked at the amount of time, funding, and revenues required to build a unicorn across each of the four strategic plays (Exhibits 10 and 11). Exhibit 10 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you.

If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Time required. Most of the companies we studied reached unicorn status within ten years of founding. Network and deep-tech players especially tend to reach unicorn status early, while significant shares of scale players (24 percent) and product players (31 percent) take more than ten years. Funding required. To reach a valuation of €1 billion, these companies, on average, required €100 million to €200 million in funding, implying a valuation of five to ten times the capital raised. However, this figure differs quite significantly among the strategic plays. Network and deep-tech players required the highest funding amount, approximately €200 million, to reach a valuation of four to six times the capital raised. Scale and product players required lower funding (approximately €80 million for scale players and €160 million for product players) to reach a valuation of ten to 12 times and five to seven times the capital raised, respectively. Revenue required. We found a wide difference in typical revenue levels among the companies pursuing different strategic plays and reaching unicorn status. Scale players achieved approximately €200 million in revenue, implying a revenue multiple of four to six times their funding, followed by network and product plays, with approximately €50 million to €90 million in revenue at multiples of ten to 20 times funding. Deep-tech unicorns are the main outlier with typical revenue levels at about €8 million, implying a revenue multiple of 100 to 150 times, reflecting the massive promise of future revenue included in deep-tech valuations. European start-ups and scale-ups and their investors can use these findings to assess their own approach and identify quicker paths to success by concentrating their resources on the right targets. Understanding one’s own product and approach within the context of these strategic plays and success factors can help organizations and players across the European start-up ecosystem follow in the footsteps of these European tech champions.

DOWNLOADS Open interactive popup Article (15 pages) European start-ups are being created and growing at an unprecedented pace these days, attracting the attention of global investors, customers, and corporate partners alike. In the process, they are proving the conventional wisdom wrong: launching a start-up amid the continent’s fragmented value pool doesn’t necessarily have to be such a challenging proposition. Sidebar About the authors This article was a collaborative effort by Kim Baroudy, Philipp Handel, Anne Hürxkens, Bouke Marsman, Tobias Strålin, and Jaap Vriesendorp, representing views from McKinsey’s Technology, Media & Telecommunications Practice. Despite the range of systemic challenges start-ups still face, including regulatory and cultural challenges, growing numbers of dynamic new ventures are thriving. These bold players offer valuable lessons for others aspiring to similar heights—and to a European continent striving to stay economically and technologically competitive with the rest of the world. To better understand how these standouts succeed, we studied the top 1,000 European tech start-ups founded after 2000 in 33 countries, which include 21st-century companies such as Spotify, Adyen, and BioNTech. We analyzed them along 15 critical growth dimensions and variables such as geography and vertical, as well as on the requirements for the time, funding, and revenues it takes to reach unicorn status (see Exhibits 1 and 2; also see the sidebar, “About our research”). Three key insights emerged from our analysis: Successful European tech start-ups follow one of four distinct roads to success: network, scale, product, or deep tech, each with its own characteristics regarding revenue growth, employees, and other similar markers. Different strategic plays require different success factors, such as overindexing on commercial roles for scale players, focusing on an initial product hook for product players, or pursuing M&A activities for scale and network players. Reaching unicorn status requires on average €100 million to €200 million in funding, with 70 to 80 percent of the companies that make it achieving the €1 billion valuation mark within ten years of founding.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Four winning strategic plays Our research on the top 1,000 European tech start-ups showed that these companies follow one of a small number of distinct paths to successful scaling, built around a core strategic approach: network, scale, product, or deep tech. While these categories are not mutually exclusive, each of them provides a path to scale. We believe this classification provides practical utility for entrepreneurs, executives, and investors as they launch and attempt to scale ventures (Exhibit 3). Exhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com By assessing themselves with regard to these strategic plays, European start-ups and scale-ups (and their investors) can spend less time and effort trying to figure out what they do best or how to do it on a wider stage and instead make better, faster decisions and focus resources for the greatest effect. Yet, knowing what strategic approach to embrace is only part of the equation. It is also critical to know what tactical moves tend to lead to success for each of the different strategic plays (Exhibit 4). Exhibit 4 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Our analysis suggests a range of five such critical factors are at work. For network players, it’s crucial to win local markets one by one and not try to grow globally in one fell swoop. Scale plays need to overindex on building strong commercial capabilities. Both network and scale players benefit from M&A. Product-play companies need to prioritize a compelling product and narrow use case initially, while for deep-tech plays, attracting the best research and development talent is most important. Winning markets one by one: Network plays Sidebar About our research To identify European tech champions, we selected a sample of 1,000 tech companies founded after the year 2000, based on their valuations. Our sample includes companies from 33 European countries; among them, the United Kingdom is home to the most start-ups, with one-third of the sample, followed by Germany and France. The companies in our sample cover nine verticals: AI, B2B software as a service (SaaS), biotech and healthcare, e-commerce and consumer, fintech, IT hardware, marketplace, media and content, and mobility. Approximately 60 percent of the start-ups come from biotech, B2B SaaS, and fintech. We developed our data set in February 2021 from our proprietary integrated database that leverages sources such as Crunchbase, PitchBook, Dealroom, LinkedIn, and S&P Capital IQ. We then assessed these companies against the following 15 critical capabilities for scaling: Business model, which includes innovativeness and total market size Tailwind, which includes macro trends in favor of business Growth, which includes revenue growth rates from organic growth as well as from M&A activities Internationalization, which includes presence in and preparedness to enter foreign markets Speed of expansion, which includes the effectiveness of the sales force and marketing teams to address new segments rapidly R&D intensity, which includes the ability to innovate continuously and develop defensible competitive moats (intellectual property, for example) Offering, which includes the strength and maturity of the value proposition for the customer/user Tech architecture, which includes the agility of the front and back ends and data availability Scalability of operations, which includes efficiency of operational scale-up, including speed of processes and decision making Value creation, which includes the ability to leverage the ecosystem for partnerships, including partner management Founding team, which includes the mindset, educational and professional background, and role of founders Human resources, which includes attractiveness to top talent and retention Culture, which includes readiness of the organization for rapid growth (culture is learning-oriented and data-driven) Funding, which includes amount, sufficiency, and source Exit strategy, which includes readiness for IPO or sale We then performed a quantitative analysis to validate our findings and a statistical analysis. To confirm the strategic plays, we applied feature-selection techniques to define the key drivers for the different strategic plays, which resulted in 11 variables. 1 1. The variables we used are as follows: vertical; number of countries with office presence; number of employees; relative number of acquisitions per year; revenues; relative valuation growth per year; relative funding growth per year; share of roles (commercial, operational, product/tech); share of employees from top 100 universities; patents granted; and trademarks registered. Cluster-validation techniques were applied using these variables to compare how similar a company is to its own cluster and to other clusters. This results in a silhouette score ranging between –1 and +1, which is a measure of how well a company fits into its strategic play. A positive silhouette score indicates that a company is well matched to its play and poorly matched to neighboring plays. Each of the plays has a positive silhouette score, with a mean of +0.14 for the full sample: Network-play silhouette score = +0.07 Scale-play silhouette score = +0.09 Product-play silhouette score = +0.15 Deep-tech-play silhouette score = +0.19 Finally, a deep-learning algorithm was applied to reduce dimensionality and enable visualization of the strategic plays for the companies we analyzed. 2 2. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. To confirm the statistical significance of the success criteria, we conducted a regression analysis 3 3. Logistic regression. to determine the p-value. A p-value gives a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. A p-value smaller than 0.05 (p < 0.05) is statistically significant and a p-value smaller than 0.001 (p < 0.001) is highly significant. The latter means that our findings have less than a one-in-a-thousand chance of being random. Where possible, we determined the p-value for the different success criteria: Network and scale plays—expanding and consolidating with M&A: p-value < 0.001 Scale plays—overindexing on commercial roles: p-value = 0.063 Product plays: not applicable (small sample size) Deep-tech plays—winning with top research talent: p-value < 0.001 As is often the case in other parts of the world, network effects can be global or local. The network effects in the sharing economy happen on a city and even neighborhood level, while the network effects from social-media companies are often more global. For example, brokerages can harness network effects across geographies, while businesses in the sharing economy or other locally-consumed services can benefit at the local level. Among the companies we studied, those that successfully pursue a network play make a trade-off between being right and being fast: they need to expand internationally to grow, but they first need to focus enough effort on individual markets to become the dominant local platform. Most Popular Insights Defining the skills citizens will need in the future world of work The comeback of corporate travel: How should companies be planning? Back to the future? Airline sector poised for change post-COVID-19 What’s going on with shipping rates? These types of companies tend to be marketplace, mobility, and social-media start-ups, such as Delivery Hero (online food delivery) and Tier (micromobility). They require an addressable market that is concentrated in a relatively small geographical area such as a city—a “hyperlocal” market. Because languages, cultures, and governments vary so widely among European cities, successful network-play start-ups enter these markets one by one, adapting their go-to-market strategy as they proceed, rather than all at once with a global approach as might be possible in a region with more uniform characteristics between cities. This effect of winning market by market is visible in the experiences of shared e-scooter players, which operate in cities where there is really only room for a few competitors, and first movers do not always win. In numerous European cities, local competitors Tier and Voi have taken the lead over Lime despite its early start (Exhibit 5). For example, in Berlin, Lime was able to provide the largest e-scooter fleet when entering the market in 2019, with its unmatched global scale. A year later, however, Tier is leading the key market with an estimated share (based on Google search interest) of 34 percent, beating Lime (28 percent). So, adapting go-to-market strategies to each new city is critical not only to winning at the outset but also to maintaining a winning position. For its part, Tier has found success by winning contracts with local governments and other local public-transport companies to offer e-scooter services. Exhibit 5 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com That focus can still be costly. To subsidize early usage across a local market, network-focused companies require the highest funding of all plays, with an average funding since founding of €243 million compared with €164 million for all of the top 1,000 companies we analyzed. Overindexing on commercial roles: Scale plays Start-ups pursuing scale plays seek to win through rapid sales growth early on, relying on initial commercial success to create the economies of scale they need to dominate a market. To achieve this early commercial success, outperforming scale start-ups invest more heavily in sales, marketing, and business-development roles. On average, these positions account for 42 percent of all employees, compared with about 33 percent for the other strategic plays. To support sales, they have a stronger focus on operational roles (17 percent) compared with product (9 percent) and deep-tech plays (14 percent). Overall, successful scale players tend to have the most employees—almost twice as many as product players and even three times as many as successful deep-tech players (Exhibit 6). At the same time, scale players typically focus less on product roles (28 percent) compared with about 40 percent for the other strategic plays. This is a reflection of the fact that success is generally achieved more through sales than through product differentiation. Exhibit 6 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com The companies that pursue this play are frequently e-commerce, consumer, or media companies, such as Spotify (music and other audio) and Zalando (fashion and lifestyle). This is confirmed in scale-play companies’ average revenue since founding, which is the highest with €826 million compared with €277 million for companies in the top 1,000 companies we analyzed. As scale companies mature, the relative size of their commercial functions decreases, resulting in the increased importance of other roles, particularly product and tech roles. In our sample of start-ups that are less than five years old, the share of commercial functions is 43 percent on average, which drops to 39 percent for start-ups that are six to ten years old, and 34 percent for older start-ups. A closer look at five of the most valuable European scale players (Farfetch, HelloFresh, Spotify, The Hut Group, and Zalando) shows this transition into product and tech roles: having matured to a degree, these scale players now have about 35 percent of their employees in commercial positions. Expanding and consolidating with M&A: Network and scale plays Companies pursuing either a network play or a scale play often rely more heavily on M&A to expand into new regions and consolidate markets, rather than launching in new markets on their own. This approach is especially effective for European start-ups, which need to enter more markets in more countries to attain an addressable market that is sizeable enough. Network- and scale-play start-ups conduct between 1.6 and 1.9 deals across all funding rounds, which is twice as many as the average in our sample (Exhibit 7). By contrast, M&A activity among ventures pursuing a product play is below the average across the group, at 0.7 deals, and most start-ups going for a deep-tech play are unlikely to engage in M&A at all. Exhibit 7 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com M&A provides the opportunity to accelerate growth and can entail arbitrage effects when a large successful start-up acquires a smaller start-up valued at a lower multiple. On the other hand, heavy M&A activity can turn out to be a costly distraction, especially for early-stage start-ups, effectively slowing their organic growth. In deciding how intensively to pursue M&A, the start-ups we studied consider organizational capacity and resources to integrate the acquired company. Starting with a stellar offering and a narrow use case: Product plays Successful product players start with an outstanding product in a narrow use case before moving to a full-suite offering. Getting the product (and market fit) right early on is more important to these kinds of start-ups, and so their product and tech roles—R&D, engineering, product management, and IT, for example—have greater importance. At the same time, their focus on commercial and operational roles is much lower than for the other strategic plays. Product players are usually B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers or fintechs such as Personio (HR software) and N26 (neobanking). We found that product players require the least amount of funding, with €145 million in funding compared with €164 million on average for all of the companies we analyzed. They are also dominant in Europe, occupying about 45 percent of the region’s top 1,000 tech start-ups. These companies’ emphasis on product excellence is also visible in Apple App Store ratings. Among a subset of companies whose apps are critical to the product experience, almost 35 percent of product-play companies have developed a top-rated app, as compared with an average of around 30 percent for other plays. Product quality is also more closely associated with growth for product plays—product-play companies with an outstanding App Store rating grow 27 percent faster than their counterparts with lower-rated apps. 1 1. We defined growth as addition of full-time-equivalent employees. With relatively limited resources initially, product-play start-ups focus intensely on both reaching adoption fast and providing a strong customer experience. To help achieve this, they often develop their initial product for a select, well-defined use case. This drives early usage as well as the collection of detailed customer feedback, which is essential for further product development and scaling-up to a larger customer base. For example, N26, the German neobank, focused on adoption early, offering only basic banking products such as current accounts and credit cards. Only later did the company expand its offering to adjacent categories. After attaining scale, it subsequently moved to higher-margin products, such as lending and investing. At that point, N26 was ready to explore partnerships with other fintechs, which helped to open up cross-sell opportunities. Winning with top research talent: Deep-tech plays Deep-tech players tend to work on AI, hardware, biotech, or healthcare, and so they focus longer and more intensively on exploratory research and development than companies pursuing other strategic plays. Lilium (electric air-mobility service) and Graphcore (accelerators for AI and machine learning) are examples. The companies in this group are characterized by a relatively low number of employees, with 211 employees on average, as compared with an average of 488 employees for the companies we analyzed. As expected, they have the highest (46 percent) share of employees in R&D roles; by comparison, product-play companies have 38 percent of employees in such roles, and the percentage is closer to 30 and 28 percent for network and scale plays, respectively. As a result, they receive on average 1.87 patents per year, significantly higher than product-play companies (0.19 patents per year), scale-play companies (0.21 patents per year), and network-play companies (0 patents per year). One important way leading deep-tech start-ups separate themselves from the rest of the pack is by hiring the top research talent in Europe. On average, 27 percent of their hires come from the top 100 international universities, which is 51 percent above the average in our sample group (Exhibit 8). 2 2. As defined in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) 2020; “2020 Academic Ranking of World Universities,” ShanghaiRanking Consultancy, August 2020, shanghairanking.com. Valuations also correlate to the quantity and caliber of the R&D team. In comparing deep-tech companies with similar funding, those with a higher share of top-tier researchers achieve 43 percent higher valuations than others (Exhibit 9).

If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com Companies pursuing a deep-tech play require more extensive funding long before they become winners. As such, they need investors that have a similar long-term vision and willingness to fund a long R&D phase. For example, Lilium, which is developing vertical take-off and landing personal aircraft, has managed to attract large investment years before reaching commercialization. What it takes to build a European tech unicorn In our analysis of the most successful European tech start-ups, we looked at the amount of time, funding, and revenues required to build a unicorn across each of the four strategic plays (Exhibits 10 and 11).

Most of the companies we studied reached unicorn status within ten years of founding. Network and deep-tech players especially tend to reach unicorn status early, while significant shares of scale players (24 percent) and product players (31 percent) take more than ten years. Funding required. To reach a valuation of €1 billion, these companies, on average, required €100 million to €200 million in funding, implying a valuation of five to ten times the capital raised. However, this figure differs quite significantly among the strategic plays. Network and deep-tech players required the highest funding amount, approximately €200 million, to reach a valuation of four to six times the capital raised. Scale and product players required lower funding (approximately €80 million for scale players and €160 million for product players) to reach a valuation of ten to 12 times and five to seven times the capital raised, respectively. Revenue required. We found a wide difference in typical revenue levels among the companies pursuing different strategic plays and reaching unicorn status. Scale players achieved approximately €200 million in revenue, implying a revenue multiple of four to six times their funding, followed by network and product plays, with approximately €50 million to €90 million in revenue at multiples of ten to 20 times funding. Deep-tech unicorns are the main outlier with typical revenue levels at about €8 million, implying a revenue multiple of 100 to 150 times, reflecting the massive promise of future revenue included in deep-tech valuations. European start-ups and scale-ups and their investors can use these findings to assess their own approach and identify quicker paths to success by concentrating their resources on the right targets. Understanding one’s own product and approach within the context of these strategic plays and success factors can help organizations and players across the European start-up ecosystem follow in the footsteps of these European tech champions.
