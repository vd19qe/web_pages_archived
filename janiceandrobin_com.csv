Facts vs Feelings March 7, 2019 We create a unique process for each client to ensure that business objectives are met and success is achieved. I have worked with Janice and Robin since 2007 in my capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the Ontario Soccer Association and more recently as Managing Partner of The OCP Group. During the period of engagement I have found Janice and Robin to be attentive, creative, innovative, and aware of the most recent trends in social media. Most importantly as a client, Janice and Robin have been committed to my needs. Guy Bradbury, Managing Partner at The OCP Group I was looking to refresh my brand, story and image but was having trouble getting myself out of the way and trying to be everything to everyone. I was feeling the need to explain 'everything' we do, instead of creating a polished and powerful statement. Working with Janice using the Story Branding process and help with design and communications to my market resulted in a creative and fresh approach to linking all my digital platforms and having a marketing and content strategy developed. We now have a powerful website, branding and clear communications strategy moving forward. Neil Thornton The Thornton Group I have been a client of Janice and Robin's for over 7 years and they are amazing at developing a business brand that you can be proud of and helps to grow your business. They work with and through your team to help you build a brand that you can be proud of and your customers cannot resist. Dino Miele Chief Information Officer at District School Board of Niagara Janice took us through the StoryBrand process and it clarified and simplified the message for Seaway Mall. Staff in different departments realized that one consistent message worked for all parts of mall management. It made it easier to coordinate marketing for events, social media and customer service. Mike Belcastro Mike Belcastro - President at Doral Holdings Limited I wanted to use social media in my campaign because I knew it was one of the best ways to reach voters. Janice and Robin were part of my core campaign team. They ran a creative and innovative social media campaign that made the difference in me being elected Mayor. Walter Sendzik Mayor City of St.Catharines Janice and Robin have been critical in the execution of the complete social media marketing plan for the Shannon Passero retail division, and with their help we have been able to directly increase sales because of their efforts. I feel this is critical in the business climate of today (especially Niagara) to see immediate results and quantifiable sales and this has been achieved with great success.

From the Desks of Janice and Robin Clarity Beats Cute and Clever Every Time June 5, 2019 Customer language March 11, 2019 We can give our customers lots of facts about our business and products. But when it comes to getting a customer to take action, it's going to be how they feel and what they believe about your business or product that will drive them. What do your customers believe? Facts vs Feelings March 7, 2019 We create a unique process for each client to ensure that business objectives are met and success is achieved. I have worked with Janice and Robin since 2007 in my capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the Ontario Soccer Association and more recently as Managing Partner of The OCP Group. During the period of engagement I have found Janice and Robin to be attentive, creative, innovative, and aware of the most recent trends in social media. Most importantly as a client, Janice and Robin have been committed to my needs. Guy Bradbury, Managing Partner at The OCP Group I was looking to refresh my brand, story and image but was having trouble getting myself out of the way and trying to be everything to everyone. I was feeling the need to explain 'everything' we do, instead of creating a polished and powerful statement. Working with Janice using the Story Branding process and help with design and communications to my market resulted in a creative and fresh approach to linking all my digital platforms and having a marketing and content strategy developed. We now have a powerful website, branding and clear communications strategy moving forward. Neil Thornton The Thornton Group I have been a client of Janice and Robin's for over 7 years and they are amazing at developing a business brand that you can be proud of and helps to grow your business. They work with and through your team to help you build a brand that you can be proud of and your customers cannot resist. Dino Miele Chief Information Officer at District School Board of Niagara Janice took us through the StoryBrand process and it clarified and simplified the message for Seaway Mall. Staff in different departments realized that one consistent message worked for all parts of mall management. It made it easier to coordinate marketing for events, social media and customer service. Mike Belcastro Mike Belcastro - President at Doral Holdings Limited I wanted to use social media in my campaign because I knew it was one of the best ways to reach voters. Janice and Robin were part of my core campaign team. They ran a creative and innovative social media campaign that made the difference in me being elected Mayor. Walter Sendzik Mayor City of St.Catharines Janice and Robin have been critical in the execution of the complete social media marketing plan for the Shannon Passero retail division, and with their help we have been able to directly increase sales because of their efforts. I feel this is critical in the business climate of today (especially Niagara) to see immediate results and quantifiable sales and this has been achieved with great success.

Shannon Passero The Post Office Working with Janice and Robin is fun and fruitful! When Janice took me through the brand story telling process, things began to reveal themselves. And then Robin took the Story we created and translated it into clear and concise messaging on my website. Voila! From the very beginning. They listened to me, heard me when I talked about the difficulties I was having, they knew what to do, came up with an action plan, and we got to work. I loved it because I didn't have to figure it out. I just had to answer the questions and they knew what to do with the answers. It's easier to talk about my business and mission in terms that actually feel comfortable. Ruth Urau Leadership Development Book a Free Consultation Today!
