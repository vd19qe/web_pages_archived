APPLY NOW Rescue Volunteer Donate Emergency Update Catastrophic fires, severe drought and extreme weather events have taken a tragic toll on native wildlife and worldwide we are now all facing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. With the coronavirus outbreak crippling society worldwide we continue to face unprecedented events. WIRES rescue team has been set up to work remotely so that we can continuously support the community and wildlife taking calls 7 days a week to provide wildlife rescue advice and assistance. Vets have been confirmed as an essential service, enabling them to operate should stricter lock down conditions be enforced and we are sharing up to date COVID-19 wildlife rescue advice for community members and volunteer rescuers, to ensure wildlife can be assisted safely during this crisis. At this stage individual WIRES volunteers, where it poses no personal risk and complies with all government directives including social distancing, are still attending rescues. However, we have less volunteers active than normal and ask for the community's patience and support during this time. Should you encounter a sick, injured or orphaned animal during your commute to and from work, when purchasing essential items or when exercising, please follow our emergency advice. The last 6 months have been unlike anything WIRES or the Australian community have experienced previously. On top of one of the worsts droughts in history massive fires that raged continually from September to February, tragically burnt over 5.4 million hectares of land in NSW alone, over 18.6 million hectares nationally and 20% of Australian forests were lost. It is impossible to know how many animals perished but it's been conservatively estimated that over 800 million animals would have been lost in NSW and over 1 billion animals in Australia since September. From November to February WIRES volunteers accepted over 12,900 rescues to assist sick, injured and orphaned native animals. In addition to supporting WIRES 28 branches in NSW, the global community support received in January enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support and over 11 weeks WIRES funded over 140 immediate rescue and care projects for licenced wildlife carers and groups across 6 states and territories. No-one knows yet what the true toll of the drought and fires has been on wild populations, whether species thought to be common now need to be reclassified and whether hundreds of species at risk of extinction have survived. For some surviving animals, unprecedented actions to preserve the future of their species may be required. WIRES are working on a range of relief and recovery plans to implement the best solutions to assist surviving wildlife and ensure the survival of remaining species. Wildlife Rescue 7 days a week, 365 days a year WIRES mission is to actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife and inspire others to do the same.

Vets have been confirmed as an essential service, enabling them to operate should stricter lock down conditions be enforced and we are sharing up to date COVID-19 wildlife rescue advice for community members and volunteer rescuers, to ensure wildlife can be assisted safely during this crisis. At this stage individual WIRES volunteers, where it poses no personal risk and complies with all government directives including social distancing, are still attending rescues. However, we have less volunteers active than normal and ask for the community's patience and support during this time. Should you encounter a sick, injured or orphaned animal during your commute to and from work, when purchasing essential items or when exercising, please follow our emergency advice. The last 6 months have been unlike anything WIRES or the Australian community have experienced previously. On top of one of the worsts droughts in history massive fires that raged continually from September to February, tragically burnt over 5.4 million hectares of land in NSW alone, over 18.6 million hectares nationally and 20% of Australian forests were lost. It is impossible to know how many animals perished but it's been conservatively estimated that over 800 million animals would have been lost in NSW and over 1 billion animals in Australia since September. From November to February WIRES volunteers accepted over 12,900 rescues to assist sick, injured and orphaned native animals. In addition to supporting WIRES 28 branches in NSW, the global community support received in January enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support and over 15 weeks WIRES has funded over 200 rescue and care projects for licenced wildlife carers, groups and vets across all 8 Australian states and territories. No-one knows yet what the true toll of the drought and fires has been on wild populations, whether species thought to be common now need to be reclassified and whether hundreds of species at risk of extinction have survived. For some surviving animals, unprecedented actions to preserve the future of their species may be required. WIRES are working on a range of relief and recovery plans to implement the best solutions to assist surviving wildlife and ensure the survival of remaining species. Wildlife Rescue 7 days a week, 365 days a year WIRES mission is to actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife and inspire others to do the same. WIRES (NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc.) has been rescuing and caring for wildlife for over 30 years and is the largest wildlife rescue organisation in Australia.

In the last 5 years WIRES has been working with organisations including: WWF, National Parks Association, Humane Society International, The Wilderness Society, Nature Conservation Council, Birdlife, RSPCA, Animal Welfare League and IFAW and we thank these organisations for their significant ongoing contribution to the wildlife rehabilitation sector.

GIVE BEFORE JUNE 30 Rescue Volunteer Donate Emergency Recovery and Preparation In the aftermath of catastrophic fires, severe drought and extreme weather taking a tragic toll on wildlife, we remain focused on rescue, rehabilitation and recovery. The last 9 months have been unlike anything WIRES or the Australian community have ever experienced. Compounding the impact of one of the worsts droughts in history, massive fires raged for months in what has become known as Australia's Black Summer. Millions of hectares of land were burnt and 20% of Australian forests were lost. In addition to supporting WIRES 28 branches in NSW, the global community support received enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support and WIRES has since funded over 240 rescue and care projects nationally for licenced wildlife carers, groups and vets across all states and territories. While the true toll of the drought and fires on wild populations cannot be quantified, it was conservatively estimated that over 1 billion animals would have been lost. Now species thought to be common may need to be reclassified and it is unknown whether hundreds of species at risk of extinction can be saved. From September to May WIRES volunteers accepted over 26,000 rescues and we continue to assist sick, injured and orphaned native animals every day. WIRES are also working on a wide range of major projects with key partners to implement the best long-term solutions to assist wildlife and we are focused on preparation for coming seasons as it is forecast that the frequency and intensity of bushfires and extreme weather will continue to increase.

The last 9 months have been unlike anything WIRES or the Australian community have ever experienced.

Millions of hectares of land were burnt, much of which was threatened species habitat and 20% of Australian forests were lost. Species thought to be common may need to be reclassified and there are hundreds of species at risk of extinction. A new report from WWF has confirmed that almost 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by the bushfire crisis, 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs. The global community support received enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support. In addition to supporting WIRES 28 branches in NSW, WIRES has funded over 240 projects nationally for licensed wildlife carers, groups and vets, critical koala research with The University of Sydney's Koala Health Hub, 64 projects to help wildlife nationally with Landcare Australia and critical recovery and conservation projects with Australian Wildlife Conservancy.

The last 9 months have been unlike anything WIRES or the Australian community have ever experienced. Compounding the impact of one of the worst droughts in history, massive fires raged for months in what has become known as Australia's Black Summer. Millions of hectares of land were burnt, much of which was threatened species habitat and 20% of Australian forests were lost. Species thought to be common may need to be reclassified and there are hundreds of species at risk of extinction. A new report from WWF has confirmed that almost 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by the bushfire crisis, 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs. The global community support received enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support. In addition to supporting WIRES 28 branches in NSW, WIRES has funded over 240 projects nationally for licensed wildlife carers, groups and vets, critical koala research with The University of Sydney's Koala Health Hub, 64 projects to help wildlife nationally with Landcare Australia and critical recovery and conservation projects with Australian Wildlife Conservancy. From September to May WIRES volunteers accepted over 26,000 rescues and we continue to assist sick, injured and orphaned native animals every day. WIRES are also working on a wide range of major projects with key partners to implement the best long-term solutions to assist wildlife and we are focused on preparation for coming seasons as it is forecast that the frequency and intensity of bushfires and extreme weather will continue to increase.

The last 12 months has been unlike anything WIRES and the Australian community have ever experienced. Compounding the impact of one of the worst droughts in history, massive fires raged for months in what has become known as Australia's Black Summer. Millions of hectares of land were burnt, much of which was threatened species habitat and 20% of Australian forests were lost. Species thought to be common may need to be reclassified and there are hundreds of species at risk of extinction. A new report from WWF confirmed that almost 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by the bushfire crisis, 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs. Global community support enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support. In addition to supporting WIRES 28 branches in NSW, WIRES has funded over 240 projects nationally for licensed wildlife carers, groups and vets. WIRES are also working on a wide range of major projects to support wildlife recovery, including critical koala research and Water for Wildlife with The University of Sydney, 64 projects to help restore wildlife habitat nationally with Landcare Australia and critical conservation projects with Aussie Ark and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. From January to August WIRES volunteers accepted over 21,600 wildlife rescues and we continue to assist sick, injured and orphaned native animals every day. WIRES are also working on projects with key partners to expand wildlife rescue and care capacity and emergency preparedness, as forecasts indicate that the frequency and intensity of bushfires and extreme weather will continue to increase. Wildlife Rescue 7 days a week, 365 days a year WIRES mission is to actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife and inspire others to do the same. WIRES (NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc.) has been rescuing and caring for wildlife for almost 35 years and is the largest wildlife rescue organisation in Australia. WIRES has over 3,000 volunteers in 28 NSW branches involved in the rescue and care of wildlife, and we have a dedicated Rescue Office that operates 24/7, 365 days a year assisting the community to help native animals in distress. WIRES is passionate about supporting smaller volunteer organisations in the wildlife sector with the same mission, as well as Universities, Veterinary Associations and other leading scientific and environmental groups. In that last 5 years WIRES has been working with organisations including: WWF Australia, National Parks Association, Humane Society International, The Wilderness Society, Nature Conservation Council, Birdlife, RSPCA, Animal Welfare League and IFAW and we thank these organisations for their significant ongoing contribution to the wildlife rehabilitation sector. Currently WIRES presence is primarily in NSW where we are responding to tens of thousands of rescues each year. WIRES receive around 170,000 calls annually to our 1300 line including thousands of interstate calls, and in the last financial year WIRES provided rescue advice and assistance for over 100,000 native animals. WIRES also plays a major role in community wildlife education with over 5 million unique visitors to our site in the last financial year, over 4 million of these in January 2020. In response to the tragic toll of the catastrophic fires, extreme weather and drought on wildlife, WIRES is actively pursuing significant opportunities to help wildlife more broadly across Australia, including partnering on projects to improve long-term outcomes for native animals.

This is particularly frequent when extreme weather events dramatically reduce leaf water content, potentially leading to large-scale mortality due to dehydration.

The last 12 months has been unlike anything WIRES and the Australian community have ever experienced. Compounding the impact of one of the worst droughts in history, massive fires raged for months in what has become known as Australia's Black Summer. Millions of hectares of land were burnt, much of which was threatened species habitat and 20% of Australian forests were lost. Species thought to be common may need to be reclassified and there are hundreds of species at risk of extinction. A new report from WWF confirmed that almost 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by the bushfire crisis, 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs. Global community support enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support.

Join Now SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-NEWS Receive a link to our '15 Ways to Help Wildlife' ebook and wildlife rescue stories and WIRES updates SIGN UP TODAY Rescue Volunteer Donate Emergency Recovery and Preparation In the aftermath of catastrophic fires, severe drought and extreme weather taking a tragic toll on wildlife, we remain focused on rescue, rehabilitation and recovery. The last 12 months has been unlike anything WIRES and the Australian community have ever experienced. Compounding the impact of one of the worst droughts in history, massive fires raged for months in what has become known as Australia's Black Summer. Millions of hectares of land were burnt, much of which was threatened species habitat and 20% of Australian forests were lost. Species thought to be common may need to be reclassified and there are hundreds of species at risk of extinction. A new report from WWF confirmed that almost 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by the bushfire crisis, 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs. Global community support enabled WIRES to provide national emergency support. In addition to supporting WIRES 28 branches in NSW, WIRES has funded over 240 projects nationally for licensed wildlife carers, groups and vets. WIRES are also working on a wide range of major projects to support wildlife recovery, including critical koala research and Water for Wildlife with The University of Sydney, 64 projects to help restore wildlife habitat nationally with Landcare Australia and critical conservation projects with Aussie Ark and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. From January to August WIRES volunteers accepted over 21,600 wildlife rescues and we continue to assist sick, injured and orphaned native animals every day. WIRES are also working on projects with key partners to expand wildlife rescue and care capacity and emergency preparedness, as forecasts indicate that the frequency and intensity of bushfires and extreme weather will continue to increase. Wildlife Rescue 7 days a week, 365 days a year WIRES mission is to actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife and inspire others to do the same. WIRES (NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc.) has been rescuing and caring for wildlife for almost 35 years and is the largest wildlife rescue organisation in Australia. WIRES has over 3,000 volunteers in 28 NSW branches involved in the rescue and care of wildlife, and we have a dedicated Rescue Office that operates 24/7, 365 days a year assisting the community to help native animals in distress. WIRES is passionate about supporting smaller volunteer organisations in the wildlife sector with the same mission, as well as Universities, Veterinary Associations and other leading scientific and environmental groups. In that last 5 years WIRES has been working with organisations including: WWF Australia, National Parks Association, Humane Society International, The Wilderness Society, Nature Conservation Council, Birdlife, RSPCA, Animal Welfare League and IFAW and we thank these organisations for their significant ongoing contribution to the wildlife rehabilitation sector. Currently WIRES presence is primarily in NSW where we are responding to tens of thousands of rescues each year. WIRES receive around 170,000 calls annually to our 1300 line including thousands of interstate calls, and in the last financial year WIRES provided rescue advice and assistance for over 100,000 native animals. WIRES also plays a major role in community wildlife education with over 5 million unique visitors to our site in the last financial year, over 4 million of these in January 2020. In response to the tragic toll of the catastrophic fires, extreme weather and drought on wildlife, WIRES is actively pursuing significant opportunities to help wildlife more broadly across Australia, including partnering on projects to improve long-term outcomes for native animals.
