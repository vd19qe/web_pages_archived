Rachel Brown, 25, was commuting through Worcester Park, Greater London, when the crash occurred just before 9am on April 7. Despite the efforts of police, London Ambulance Service paramedics and members of the public, she was pronounced dead at the scene. There have been no arrests made and all parties remained at the site of the incident, according to Scotland Yard. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that Ms Brown, originally from Staines, Middlesex, was a member of staff, though they would not say in what capacity. It is understood that she had worked in the forces analytical unit. Friends described her as a “talented and very special young woman” who helped domestic assault victims in London through her work. On a Facebook tribute page for Ms Brown, Gemma Charge, her friend and former colleague, said: “Rachel, you were a beautiful, talented and very special young woman. From the moment you joined our team, your energy and drive was such an inspiration. It was a joy and a privilege to have you in my team.” Ms Brown, who studied law at Queen's University Belfast, was also known as a keen rower who represented Staines Boat Club senior women's team for several years. The university's rowing club said: “Yet whilst she was both a talented and technical oarswoman, Rachel was also a popular crew member, loved and appreciated by so many for her bright nature, her kind heart, her constant encouragement and her colourful kit.” 2626 reactions Politics GeekWire Gates Foundation’s CEO worries about pandemic politics — and says ‘we have nothing to hide’ Seattle's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is in the public health spotlight, thanks to its efforts to head off just the sort of global pandemic we're now experiencing — but not all the exposure it's getting is healthy.

The US president has defined as ""Obamagate"" an episode involving the ""unmasking"" of his first national security adviser Michael Flynn after his name appeared in redacted form in intelligence reports related to Russia. He claims that, during the presidential transition period at the end of 2016, the Obama administration abused its power for political reasons in targeting Mr Flynn.

Iranian media covered the apparent ""honour"" crime extensively, with Ebtekar newspaper leading its front page with the headline ""Unsafe father's house"". According to local media, Romina Ashrafi was killed in her sleep on May 21 by her father, who decapitated her in the family home in Talesh in northern Gilan province. The reports said her father had refused her permission to marry a man fifteen years her senior, spurring her to run away, but she was returned home after her father reported her. The legal marriage age in Iran is 13 for women. Iranian media reported that after authorities detained the teenager, she told a judge she feared for her life if she was returned to home. But what most outraged public opinion was the lenient punishment the father is likely to face, Ebtekar wrote. The newspaper notes that Iran's normal ""eye for an eye"" retributive justice does not apply to fathers who kill their children. Accordingly, he is likely to face three to 10 years in prison, a sentence that could be reduced further, the newspaper wrote, denouncing the ""institutionalised violence"" of Iran's ""patriarchal culture"". With the farsi hashtag Romina_Ashrafi focusing outrage on Twitter, President Hassan Rouhani ""expressed his regrets"" in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, pleading for the speedy passing of several anti-violence bills, his office said. On Twitter, Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, Masoumeh Ebtekar, said a bill on the protection of young people was in the ""final phase"" of validation by Iran's Guardian Council. The council, which vets legislation to ensure compliance with Iran's constitution and Islamic sharia law, has thrice previously called for changes to the law after it was passed by lawmakers, Ebtekar newspaper wrote. The publication fears that if the council sends back the bill, it will be buried by Iran's new parliament, which held its first session Wednesday and is dominated by conservatives and hardliners opposed to Rouhani.

Iranian media covered the apparent ""honour"" crime extensively, with Ebtekar newspaper leading its front page with the headline ""Unsafe father's house"". According to local media, Romina Ashrafi was killed in her sleep on May 21 by her father, who decapitated her in the family home in Talesh in northern Gilan province. The reports said her father had refused her permission to marry a man fifteen years her senior, spurring her to run away, but she was returned home after her father reported her. The legal marriage age in Iran is 13 for women. Iranian media reported that after authorities detained the teenager, she told a judge she feared for her life if she was returned to home. But what most outraged public opinion was the lenient punishment the father is likely to face, Ebtekar wrote. The newspaper notes that Iran's normal ""eye for an eye"" retributive justice does not apply to fathers who kill their children. Accordingly, he is likely to face three to 10 years in prison, a sentence that could be reduced further, the newspaper wrote, denouncing the ""institutionalised violence"" of Iran's ""patriarchal culture"". With the farsi hashtag Romina_Ashrafi focusing outrage on Twitter, President Hassan Rouhani ""expressed his regrets"" in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, pleading for the speedy passing of several anti-violence bills, his office said. On Twitter, Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, Masoumeh Ebtekar, said a bill on the protection of young people was in the ""final phase"" of validation by Iran's Guardian Council. The council, which vets legislation to ensure compliance with Iran's constitution and Islamic sharia law, has thrice previously called for changes to the law after it was passed by lawmakers, Ebtekar newspaper wrote. The publication fears that if the council sends back the bill, it will be buried by Iran's new parliament, which held its first session Wednesday and is dominated by conservatives and hardliners opposed to Rouhani. 232232 reactions Politics The Independent Johnny Cash’s granddaughter called liberal p**** for wearing face mask in Nashville grocery store, says mother Johnny Cash’s granddaughter was called a “liberal p***y” for wearing a face mask inside a Nashville grocery store, according to her own mother.Rosanne Cash recently counted the incident on Twitter, saying that her daughter previously spent time on a ventilator after contracting the H1N1 virus. 148148 reactions Business Yahoo Life Strippers work to 'take back all of the power' while clubs are shuttered during the pandemic How strippers are banding together to change the industry while facing unique challenges as clubs are closed.

World The Telegraph Putin declares a state of emergency after 20,000 tons of diesel oil leak into Arctic river due to climate change Vladimir Putin declared a state of emergency after more than 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled into a river in the Russian Arctic. Several miles of the Ambarnaya river were turned red after a fuel tank at a power plant in Norilsk, an industrial city in northern Siberia, collapsed on Friday. Mr Putin berated regional officials for their slow response in a Zoom call broadcast on state television on Wednesday. ""Why did government agencies only find out about this two days after the fact?"" he asked Sergei Lipin, the head of the subsidiary that runs the plant. ""Are we going to learn about emergency situations from social media?"" Yevgenny Zinichev, the head of the Emergencies Ministry and and Alexander Uss, the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai said that they only learnt about the spill on May 31, two days after it occurred and established a true picture of the situation ""only after information on social media."" Mr Uss said officials were considering burning the oil off, but that there was no precedent for attempting to do so on such a large scale and it was not clear if it would succeed. The power plant is a subsidiary of Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium. The company said in a statement that no one had been hurt by the accident and that it had deployed emergency teams to clean up the spill. It said the spill appeared to have been caused by ""a sudden sinking of supporting posts in the basement of the storage tank"" and that it was reviewing the threat of melting permafrost at other storage facilities. Russia's investigative committee, its rough equivalent of the FBI, has opened a criminal investigation. The head of the power plant has been taken into custody but has not been charged.

The move came after Ms Exeter posted a 12-minute long video to Instagram, claiming Ms Mulroney, a “former acquaintance”, ""took offence"" to her call of action for people to join the Black Lives Matter movement, which has swept across the world in the wake of the killing of African-American George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis.

He was Charles Voyde Harrelson – father of Hollywood A-lister Woody Harrelson. Crazed and hallucinating from injecting cocaine, Charles Harrelson had convinced himself there was a bomb hidden in the muffler of his car. He pulled over to the side of the highway and began blasting at the car with his gun, blowing his tyre. Harrelson – shirtless and wearing cutoff jeans and gold chains – held himself hostage. With his gun under his chin, he threatened to kill himself and claimed – among other things – that he killed John F. Kennedy. Harrelson was later sentenced to two life sentences for shooting the federal judge John H. Wood, nicknamed “Maximum John” for his tough sentences. He was set to preside over the trial of marijuana kingpin Jimmy Chagra. The life and crimes of Charles Harrelson are now the subject of Son of a Hitman, an investigative Spotify podcast by journalist Jason Cavanagh. Speaking with witnesses, lawyers, law enforcement, and relatives of his victims (of both convicted and alleged crimes), Son of a Hitman paints a damning, ruthless portrait of Charles V. Harrelson: a murderer-for-hire; a woman-beater; a con-man; a drug mover and user; and debt collector. One wild story even has him smuggling weapons into Cuba with Jack Ruby, the man who shot Lee Harvey Oswald. The sister of one murder victim described Harrelson as “cold as ice… there was nothing in his eyes.” 3131 reactions Entertainment The Independent James Gandolfini threatened to ‘beat the f***’ out of Harvey Weinstein, says Steve Schirripa James Gandolfini once became so upset with Harvey Weinstein that he wanted to physically attack him, his Sopranos co-star Steve Schrippa has said.Schirripa and Michael Imperioli were guests on the Joe Rogan Experience this week, where they reflected on their time with Gandolfini on the HBO show.

Start the conversation Celebrity The Telegraph Brian Dennehy, tough-guy character actor who found fame in the Rambo film First Blood – obituary Brian Dennehy, who has died aged 81, was a hulking character actor and former US Marine who seemed to play every tough-cookie supporting role in American film in the 1980s, before belatedly proving himself to be an outstanding stage performer. Dennehy frequently played cops, most notably in the inaugural Rambo film, First Blood (1982). As the small-town sheriff pursuing the soldier-turned-drifter John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), Dennehy was the reactionary villain of the piece, but he also managed to convey the character’s fundamental decency. He brought similar nuances to his portrayals of dogged police detectives in the thrillers Gorky Park (1983) and F/X (1986); the corrupt Sheriff Cobb in the Western Silverado (1985); and the blustering and possibly homicidal district attorney in Presumed Innocent (1990). 176176 reactions World The Telegraph Teenager who pushed boy off Tate viewing platform blamed social services and said he was 'mad' The teenager who threw a six-year-old from a viewing platform at the Tate Modern laughed and told the child’s father “Yes, I am mad” before blaming social services for his actions, a court has heard. Jonty Bravery, 18, who is autistic, has pleaded guilty to attempted murder after scooping up the boy and hurling him over the railings “without any hesitation” last August in front of his horrified parents. A sentence hearing at the Old Bailey heard that he had planned the incident “well in advance” and had researched the easiest way to kill someone as he had been ""seriously unhappy"" and wanted to get out of his supported accommodation. Deanna Heer, prosecuting, told the court: ""He said he had to prove a point to 'every idiot' who had ever said he did not have a mental health problem that he should not be in the community."" She said he was under one-on-one supervision with Hammersmith and Fulham Social Services at the time of the attack, but was allowed to go out unaccompanied for four-hour periods. However, a recording apparently taken by one of his care workers in Autumn 2018, in which Bravery can be heard talking about his plans to kill somebody by pushing them off a building, suggests that opportunities to stop the attack were missed.

The US president has planned a huge celebration for his visit to South Dakota, one of his main events since resuming campaigning, with fighter jets performing a fly past over the monument and the first fireworks display on the site since 2009 to mark the public holiday. It comes as US states with increasing coronavirus case numbers have been forced to close beaches and bars amid fears the July 4th celebrations over the long weekend will cause a fresh surge in the virus. Several Native American groups plan to protest the visit to the monument, arguing that Mr Trump should have sought permission from the area's Sioux tribal governments before holding the event.

The decision means that for the first time much of eastern Oklahoma is legally considered a reservation. More than 1.8 million people live in the land at issue, including roughly 400,000 in Tulsa, the state’s second-largest city. The unique case represented the opportunity for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the limits of tribal sovereignty and revisit the country's history of displacing native tribes from their land. Under the ruling, tribe members who live within the boundaries would become exempt from certain state obligations such as paying state taxes, while certain Native Americans found guilty in state courts may be able to challenge their convictions on jurisdictional grounds.

Mr Cain, 74, a businessman, became a household name in the United States in 2012 when he briefly topped polls in the race for the party's nomination. His signature policy was the ""9-9-9"" tax reform plan - a nine per cent income tax, a nine per cent corporate tax, and nine per cent sales tax. The candidate told crowds: ""If 10 per cent is good enough for God, nine per cent ought to be good enough for the federal government."" It was not clear where Mr Cain contracted the virus. He was hospitalised less than two weeks after attending Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma last month. Several of Mr Trump's campaign staff tested positive for the virus after the rally, at which Mr Cain was photographed not wearing a mask. Mr Cain died in hospital in Atlanta and became one of the highest profile American victims of the virus. A spokesman said: ""We're heartbroken, and the world is poorer: Herman Cain has gone to be with the Lord. ""Herman Cain - our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us - has passed away.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee issued a three-tweet clarification on Thursday evening after remarks he made in an interview triggered a backlash. Mr Biden made the comment in passing when asked about normalising relations with Cuba during a conversation with a panel of journalists. “And by the way, what you all know but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things,” he said. “You go to Florida you find a very different attitude about immigration in certain places than you do when you're in Arizona.

Belly Mujinga, 47, died with Covid-19 in April, around two weeks after allegedly being spat at by a man who claimed to have the virus at London's Victoria station, leaving a widower and an 11-year-old daughter. British Transport Police (BTP) interviewed a 57-year-old man over the incident but said there was not enough evidence a crime had taken place, following a review of statements from key witnesses, including colleagues, and CCTV footage. Detectives found there was insufficient evidence of spitting or another action that could lead to infection and concluded Mrs Mujinga's death did not occur because of that incident. But the force asked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to review the evidence and look into whether there were any further lines of inquiry. Deputy chief Crown prosecutor Suzanne Llewellyn said on Thursday: ""Belly Mujinga's death from Covid-19 aged just 47 in April was a heartbreaking event that shocked the country. ""As part of this review, we studied enhanced CCTV, forensic materials and witness statements. ""CCTV and witness evidence was insufficiently clear and consistent to substantiate allegations of deliberate coughing or spitting, meaning no charges can be brought for assault or public order offences. ""Medical tests confirmed the suspect had not been infected with coronavirus, which together with the lack of other evidence rules out any charges in relation to homicide.” Sports KGO – San Francisco Video '3rd wave' of COVID-19 likely in CA, predicts top UCSF epidemiologist He says California appears to be at the end of a second wave and that it would be ""almost impossible"" to return to a baseline number of cases given how widespread the virus is and the number of infections.

President Trump's brother Robert is hospitalized amid reports he is 'very ill,' White House says USA TODAY Trump's younger brother, Robert, is hospitalized in New York Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune Lifestyle CBC 'I'm not going to risk her health ... for Grade 6': Why these Calgary parents plan to keep their kids home A child who's too anxious about the COVID-19 pandemic to return to school. An immunocompromised single mom whose doctor recommended keeping her daughter out of classes. A parent who feels the Alberta government's return to school plan is ""reckless."" These are just some of the Calgarians making the heart-wrenching decision to opt for the public school system's online learning this fall rather than sending kids back to the classrooms.Registration for the Calgary Board of Education's short-term Hub online learning program opened this week. It's meant as an alternative for families who aren't comfortable returning for ""near-normal"" in-person learning with the ongoing pandemic.For Tamara Rose, who has shared her experience with the education system with CBC News since the outset of the pandemic, keeping her seven-year-old daughter home in September is a necessity. ""My doctor didn't recommend for me to put her back into class,"" she said. ""So now we are going to have to try and manage doing the [Hub] home school while I continue to work full-time from home while being a single mom.""Rose's doctor made that recommendation because she has multiple autoimmune diseases.""One of them is in my lungs and therefore it makes me a higher risk for adverse effects from COVID-19, with the possibility of permanent lung damage,"" she said.""We're hoping that something changes in February and she can go back to class. But we're prepared to just keep going for the whole year this way.""Rose said her boyfriend and her father have stepped up to help her make Hub learning possible for her daughter, who is about to start Grade 2. ""But with my dad being high risk as well — he unfortunately has a lot of the same medical things that I have — we have to completely close our cohort,"" she said. Rose said she knows she's fortunate to be able to make this work, and hopes her decision and that of other parents opting to use Hub helps the bigger picture.""I'm hoping that with the choice for parents to stay home it will actually even decrease the class sizes slightly for the people that do have to send their kids,"" she said. ""I hope that makes for a safer environment for pretty much everybody.""Prospect of staying home upsets some studentsDana Watson signed up her daughter for Grade 6 with Hub. It was a decision she said that wasn't easy. ""She is upset, she's not happy about it. She's a social creature and she misses all of that,"" said Watson.But with a family member who is considered high-risk, Watson said she didn't want to put her daughter into a crowded classroom — where no one really knows what will happen in the fall. ""I would have liked to have seen the setup of the school before making the decision but that's not possible because it's summer. And they're starting in September and we had to register for the Hub previous to that,"" she said. ""I'm not going to risk her health or another person's health for Grade 6.""Watson said she'll still be working full-time, but her husband works from home and will cut back his hours to make this possible. Parents forced to decide without knowing school plansJoanne Pitman, superintendent of school improvement with the CBE, said the board has heard from parents the desire to have individual school plans, but she said it's important to recognize that the plans are dependent on student enrolment.""The vast majority of school authorities across the province are asking families to be able to indicate whether or not they will attend in-person or online learning earlier and before individual school plans are posted,"" she said. Pitman said individual school plans will be completely in line with the re-entry guidelines.""All of our schools will be required to have very clear seating plans, and the primary component of ensuring that wherever possible the movement of furniture and space to create ultimate space between students based on the number of students in a room follow the guidelines set out by Albert Education.""Parent wishes class sizes were cappedMarissa Maitland Hare said she's still undecided regarding if she'll register her daughter, Audrey Maitland, for Grade 4 with Hub or in-person.She's still holding out hope that the UCP government will make changes to the province's school re-entry guidelines so that class sizes and cohorts are capped. ""I don't want to send them if it's going to be how it was, say, March 1st, in a classroom of 24 or 25 kids — all in one place and without any other measures in place like proper Plexiglas barriers that would allow kids to work close to each other, and their table configurations or with the teachers,"" she said. Maitland Hare said Audrey seems apprehensive about going back for in-person learning. ""She said she would probably rather go online, which I found really shocking because she was the one who was totally burnt-out from it,"" she said.""But she's got major anxiety about COVID. She gets really upset when her brother doesn't properly social distance playing with kids on the playground. She's sort of the mask police in our house, making sure that we all have our masks before we go out.""Maitland Hare said she's scheduled a call with her MLA to talk about her concerns about the re-entry plan. It just seems so wrong in the face of it that we'd be asking kids to go and do the things that we as adults won't do. \- Marissa Maitland Hare, parent""He's not sitting with all of his colleagues in the legislature because they know it's unsafe for that many people to be together. I haven't been at my job since March because my employer recognizes that it's unsafe for 100 or so of us that sit on my floor to all be together in our open environment,"" she said.""It just seems so wrong in the face of it that we'd be asking kids to go and do the things that we as adults won't do.""Alberta plan feels 'reckless,' another mom saysLucy Martin registered her son for Grade 6 with Hub.She said that compared with how British Columbia is handling its return of students, Alberta's plan feels ""reckless"" to her. ""Given the lack of safety provisions the UCP has provided, I don't feel safe for my son to return to a class of 32-plus with one teacher. His school is an older building and the classrooms are tiny,"" she said.But she worries about her son's lack of social interactions while learning from home. ""He's an only child so learning at home can feel isolating,"" she said. ""When I've asked him how he feels about it, he's OK and comfortable with the online learning format but really misses his classmates, teacher, music class and gym.""Martin said she's made a big personal sacrifice by quitting her job to make this work but is hopeful it will go smoother than the emergency online schooling put in place in March. ""I feel like the Hub will provide a lot more curriculum detail versus the emergency online learning, which was lacking a lot given how it had to be put in place in such a short time,"" she said.Hub requires major commitment from parents, studentsPitman said the Hub option will require a significant commitment from parents and students. Students in Grades 1 to 6 will have class instruction for set times each week for between five and six hours, to be supplemented by pre-recorded videos and direct instructions that will be specific to assignments. ""Students will also then have independent work on top of those other instructional periods and then there's always individual followup with students or small groups,"" said Pitman, noting it will all add up to about 20 hours of work a week.Students in Grades 7 to 9 will have five to seven hours of direct instruction, supplemented also by videos and independent work. ""Four hours daily or one hour per course daily of independent work,"" she said, noting it would add up to about 25 hours of work a week. High school students will receive two hours per-week of direct instruction per course, paired with videos and independent work, resulting in 30 hours per week of time that must be committed toward coursework. Pitman said once registration for Hub closes on Aug. 24, the CBE will reassign existing teachers to meet the demand. ""At this time, it is challenging to make a full prediction of how many parents will be registering their students for the Hub,"" she said. ""We have said that we are not limiting registration to the Hub for existing CBE students."" Trending Now 1. Justin Bieber 2. Thandie Newton 3. Coronavirus 4. Jennifer Aniston 5.

Lifestyle The Telegraph Madonna’s latest social media mishap shows the perils of carrying on past your partying prime Not sure when you last saw Madonna. Chances are it was the picture she took of herself in the bath, almost but not quite covered in rose petals, reminding us that Covid-19 was the great equaliser? Anyway, this week Madonna turned 62, which prompted her to post a picture of herself in her new evil mermaid incarnation, saucily proffering a tray of marijuana to the camera. Uh-oh. Keen as we are for Madonna to do her thing, and not go quietly into the free-bus-pass decade, this image suggests that she never got the How Not To Party Post 60 memo. And while you can see why Madonna would think that’s not a memo that she needs to be paying attention to, she’s probably wrong.

But it has much more to do with the dire economics of drilling for expensive oil in remote locations. Because of those high costs and low prices, the state's oil production has declined 75% from its 2 million barrels per day peak in 1988. Celebrity USA TODAY Entertainment 'Why lie?'

World The Telegraph Iranian man sentenced to nine years in prison for beheading daughter while she slept in 'honour killing' An Iranian has been sentenced to nine years in jail for beheading his teenaged daughter in her sleep, local media reported Friday, adding that the mother wants him executed. The so-called ""honour"" killing of 14-year-old Romina Ashrafi on May 21 sparked widespread outrage, with media condemning ""institutionalised violence"" in the Islamic republic. Media said Romina was decapitated at the family home in the village of Talesh in the northern province of Gilan. ""Despite the judicial authorities' insistence on a 'special handling' of the case, the verdict has terrified me and my family,"" Rana Dashti, the mother, told ILNA news agency. ""I don't want my husband to return to our village ever again,"" she said, calling for the verdict to be reviewed and changed to ""execution"". Having lived with the man for 15 years, Dashti said she now fears for the life of the rest of her family. Ebtekar newspaper said at the time of Romina's killing that Iran's ""eye for an eye"" retributive justice does not apply to a father who kills his child, for which the customary sentence is jail time and fines. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has ""expressed his regrets"" following the girl's killing and called for the speedy passing of several anti-violence bills. Romina had reportedly run away after the father refused to give permission for her to marry a man 15 years her senior. But she was detained by authorities and taken home, despite having pleaded with a judge that she feared for her life if returned. The man she wanted to marry, Bahman Khavari, was sentenced to two years in prison, local media said, without specifying the charge. The legal age of marriage for women in Iran is 13.

The reporting in The Atlantic magazine, which relayed the accounts of a number of unnamed starred generals and anonymous Marine Corps officers, appears to show Mr Trump denigrating soldiers and their service to the country. According to one account, widely thought to have been given by former chief of staff John Kelly, Mr Trump was said to have visited the Arlington Cemetery gravesite of Mr Kelly's son, Robert, who was killed in 2010 in Afghanistan, on Memorial Day 2017 and turned to Mr Kelly and said: ""I don't get it.

Celebrity The Telegraph Meghan and Archie to sue in UK after court hears they were 'papped' while out dog walking The Duchess of Sussex and her baby son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor are suing a photo agency which ""papped"" them while dog walking in Canada, as a court hears claims she ""knew everything that was going on"" but ""carried on walking"". Archie, who is one, and his mother are both listed as claimants in the case, heard for the first time at the High Court in London today and the latest in the Sussexes' battle with the tabloid press. The pictures showed the Duchess carrying Archie in a sling while walking near their temporary home on Vancouver Island, Canada, in January, smiling broadly and holding her two dogs on a lead while security walked at a distance behind her. At a remote hearing on Wednesday, the Duchess's barrister Jonathan Barnes said Meghan and her son were ""papped"" by a photographer for the US arm of the Splash News and Pictures Agency which then sold the images. The agency argues that the Duchess ""knew everything that was going on and was a volunteer in the sense that she carried on walking when she knew she was being photographed"", the court heard. The case is being brought by the Duchess in her own right, and she is listed as a ""litigation friend"" for Archie, a legal term meaning she is appointed to make decisions about the court case for her child.

Mr Trump unveiled his healthcare ""vision"" during a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, a key swing state in this year's race, saying his ""America First healthcare plan"" would deliver quality health care at a ""much lower cost"" to the public. Mr Trump has repeatedly attacked the Affordable Care Act, the signature healthcare policy signed into law by President Barack Obama, and promised to repeal and replace it with an alternative healthcare plan during his first term. Health The Telegraph New coronavirus mutation could be evolving to get around mask-wearing and hand-washing Covid-19 may have become more contagious as it has mutated, the largest genetic study carried out in the US into the virus has suggested, as scientists warn it could be adapting to interventions such as mask-wearing and social distancing. One variant of the novel coronavirus is now one of the most dominant in America, accounting for 99.9 per cent of cases in one area studied. The paper concluded that a mutation that changes the structure of the “spike protein” on the surface of the virus may be driving the outsized spread of that particular strain. Researchers have been sequencing the genomes of the coronavirus at Houston Methodist, one of the largest hospitals in Texas, since early March, when the virus first appeared in the city. To date, they have documented 5,085 sequences. In the first wave of the outbreak in Houston around March, some 71 per cent of the viruses were characterised by the mutation, which originated in China and is known as D614G. By the second wave, which began in May and is ongoing, the D614G mutation leaped to 99.9 per cent prevalence. A tiny tweak in the spike protein of the dominant variant switches an amino acid from aspartic acid to glycine. The new mutation appears to be outdistancing all of its competitors.

World The Telegraph Thousands of animals found dead in Chinese depot after being bought online as pets Some 4,000 pet dogs, rabbits, cats and hamsters that were purchased online have been found dead in boxes at a processing hub in central China after being stranded there for nearly a week, according to an animal welfare group. The group Utopia Animal Rescue said they managed to save just over 1,000 animals but the remainder had perished by the time they arrived at the Dongxing facility in Luohe, Henan province earlier this month. “We’ve done rescues before but this was the first time I had experienced something this tragic,” one volunteer with the group told the South China Morning Post. “When we got there, there were several small mountains of boxes containing animals. Many of them were dead and had started to rot and give off terrible smells,” she said. The incident has once more raised concerns about the lack of regulation of online pet sales in China, where live animals can be bought and sold online with relative ease.

Politics The Telegraph Exclusive swing state polling shows Biden pulling away after debate and Trump's coronavirus Joe Biden is pulling away from Donald Trump in key swing states after the president’s combative debate performance and his positive test for coronavirus, new polling for The Telegraph has found. The share of voters saying they back the Democratic presidential nominee has jumped in four of the six states Mr Trump won by the narrowest margins in 2016, according to research taken after both events. The responses suggest that far from the US president closing the polling gap by which he has trailed Mr Biden for much of the year it is actually widening as the race enters its final few weeks. Mr Trump will be hoping either the polls are proved wrong again, as they were in 2016, turnout among his supporters far exceeds his rival or something happens between now and November 3 to cause a major rethink among voters. Redfield & Wilton Strategies has been polling six battleground states for The Telegraph throughout the campaign to reveal the state of the race where it matters most.

Conservationists say that interesting creatures are often unearthed at Ministry of Defence sites because they are undisturbed and unaffected by farming or development. The Great Fox-Spider is Red-listed as ‘Critically Endangered’ and was feared extinct in the UK as it hadn’t been seen since 1993. It was discovered by an arachnid-obsessed worker at the Surrey Wildlife Trusts, who had been hunting high and low on MoD land with his torch. For two years, Mike Waite, spider enthusiast at the Trust, walked around for hours at night in the hopes of finding the nocturnal, ground-dwelling arachnid. Finally he discovered some unidentifiable immature spiderlings, on MOD land managed by the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust, and then, at last several mature males and one female Great Fox-Spider, which was 55mm or just over two inches in diameter including its hairy, spiny legs. The delighted naturalist said: “I am naturally over-the-moon to have finally proved the continued existence of the Great Fox-Spider in the UK. Although I’ve always held a latent interest in spiders, as a bona-fide arachnologist, I am still a relative newbie, so am doubly pleased to have made this important contribution to our scientific knowledge.” Mr Waite now plans to continue his study to gauge the size of the population, looking for their silk-lined burrows over winter. The spiders are named because of their wolf-like chasing of prey. They love to run across sandy terrain, over gravel and rocks before catching insects. The Great Fox-Spider then pounces, injecting the unfortunate bugs with deadly venom. The spider is then ready to feast on its catch using its strong, fang-bearing front appendages called chelicerae. Great Fox-Spiders have excellent eyesight with wrap-around vision provided by eight black eyes on its head, or cephalothorax. Two large eyes glint from the top of the head; two large eyes stare out the front; and four smaller eyes form a row just above the spider’s mouth. Conservationists have praised the MOD for preserving land for important animals. Rob Free, Weald Reserves Manager, Amphibian and Reptile Conservation (ARC) said: ""The discovery of the Great Fox-Spider shows how amazing the MOD heathland is, not just for spiders, but also for Sand Lizard, Smooth Snake, Dartford Warbler, Nightjar, Silver-studded Blue butterfly and Marsh Clubmoss. The spider’s rediscovery is a wonderful exoneration of all the incredibly hard work put in by MOD staff, Conservation Group members, ARC staff and volunteers."" ARC has managed key parts of the site since 1974, with particular emphasis on preventing the endangered Sand Lizard from becoming extinct, and as MOD’s conservation partner, ARC has been managing much of the open heathland on the site since January 2019. Managed for nature’s recovery, the MOD site is recognised as being nationally important for its populations of rare bird, reptile and invertebrate species. Rich Lowey, Defence Infrastructure Organisation's Head of Technical Services, said: “Many people are unaware of the size and diversity of the Defence estate and its tremendous wildlife richness. It has generally been protected from agricultural intensification and urban development, so it now provides a vital sanctuary for many of the country’s most rare and endangered species and habitats. We are proud to hear that the Great Fox-Spider has survived because of MOD’s commitment and enthusiasm to have positive and active conservation management on the Estate and close integrated working with ARC, Surrey Wildlife Trust and MOD Conservation Groups.” World Quartz The deadly, hidden cost of Africa’s billion-dollar business importing used cars from US and Europe The combination of a lack of vehicle emissions standards and high level of used car imports are worsening Africa's air pollution problem. Politics The Telegraph US presidential election: what happens if the result is contested? With Donald Trump refusing to commit to accepting the election result and both parties primed to deploy an army of lawyers, the US is possibly facing weeks of uncertainty over who will become the country's 46th president. Unless there is a decisive result, the US will be facing a contested election for the second time in 20 years, with the result being decided in the Supreme Court - or even in Congress. There is machinery in place to ensure a president is finally chosen, but the road to the inauguration on Jan 20 will have plenty of twists and turns. It's all down to the Founding Fathers US elections are not decided by the popular vote, but by the Electoral College, a system put in place by the Founding Fathers of the United States at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. It was established at a time when the direct election of a country's political chief executive was unheard of and the Electoral College - the gathering together of a temporary group of electors for the purposes of choosing a president - was, in reality, a compromise between those who wanted the power vested in Congress and those who wanted something more democratic. Two of the last five elections have been won by a candidate who secured fewer votes than his opponent: George W Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016. It means that the presidential election is, in reality, not one contest but 50 with the result hinging on a few thousand votes in ""battleground states"", which are likely to be the focus of a flurry of litigation this year. Have elections been contested before? Yes, on four occasions. In 1800, the election between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, ended in a dead heat with both candidates securing 73 votes in the Electoral College. The decision went to the House of Representatives with each state getting one vote in what is known as a contingent election. It is a procedure which could come into play again in a few months time. It took 36 votes before Thomas Jefferson secured the support of a majority of the 16 state delegations. Burr, who is best known for killing political rival Alexander Hamilton in a duel, became vice president. In 1824, Andrew Jackson won both the popular vote and secured more votes than his four rivals in the Electoral College, but failed to secure a majority. It took another contingent election to decide the result and install John Quincy Adams, rather than Andrew Jackson, as president. The 1876 election between Republican candidate Rutherford Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden is seen as setting a potential precedent for this year. Three states, Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina, sent rival slates to the Electoral College. It was left to Congress to sort the mess out. Voting on party lines, the presidency was awarded to Hayes. The hotly contested 2000 election is seen as a foretaste of what might lie ahead in November. Everything depended on Florida and the fate of its 25 votes in the Electoral College. It all hinged on thousands of ballots which were thrown out because they had been incorrectly punched by voting machines leaving what were known as ""hanging chads"". Convinced that they would have won if these votes were reinstated, the Democrats demanded a full recount. The recount was stopped by the Supreme Court six days before the Electoral College was due to meet, leaving Mr Bush 537 votes ahead - and Mr Gore conceded.

In telling comments in the White House’s Rose Garden, the US president let slip his uncertainty about remaining as president while discussing policy to tackle Covid-19. Since Mr Biden was declared the election winner on Saturday Mr Trump has refused to concede, insisting he was the real victor and launching legal challenges to fight his case. However on Friday afternoon in a press address on the pandemic that avoided discussion of the election Mr Trump nonetheless let his doubt show. “Ideally we won’t go to a lockdown. I will not go, this administration will not be going to a lockdown,” Mr Trump said. “Hopefully the, the, er, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell. But I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown.” The “who knows” comment about the election winner was markedly less tub-thumping than the president’s tone on his Twitter feed, where he has claimed without evidence that the election was “stolen” from him.

Entertainment The Telegraph New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin fired for exposing himself during work Zoom call The New Yorker has fired longtime staff writer Jeffrey Toobin after he reportedly exposed himself on a work Zoom call last month. He had already been on suspension and is also on leave from CNN, where he is chief legal analyst. ""I was fired today by New Yorker after 27 years as a Staff Writer. I will always love the magazine, will miss my colleagues, and will look forward to reading their work,"" Toobin tweeted on Wednesday. In a company memo, Conde Nast Chief People Officer Stan Duncan wrote that its ""investigation regarding Jeffrey Toobin is complete, and as a result, he is no longer affiliated with our company."" ""I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct,"" Duncan said. Toobin, 60, is one of the country's most prominent legal authors and commentators. He is a former associate counsel in the Department of Justice who for the New Yorker has written about everything from the O.J. Simpson murder trial to the impeachment hearings of President Donald Trump. He has been with CNN since 2002 and is the author of several books, most recently ""True Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Investigation of Donald Trump,"" published in August. His 1996 book, ""The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson,"" was adapted into an FX series. Trending Now 1. Trump Lawsuits 2. Grey's Anatomy 3. Doug Supernaw 4. Kim Ng 5. GMC Sierra 1500 6.

Politics The Telegraph Trump strips US Fed of emergency credit powers in latest scorched-earth move The Trump Administration is to shut down the emergency lending powers of the US Federal Reserve, taking extraordinary action to block reserve funds for the incoming Biden Treasury and prevent a Democrat bail-out of state and local governments. The pre-emptive strike marks a breakdown in the normal co-operation between the US Treasury and the Fed, and comes just as the winter wave of Covid-19 reaches a crescendo. The services sector is already spiralling back into contraction, with a cliff-edge approaching for jobless support. “We are in a perilous moment for the economy,” said Jason Furman, the former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Vaccine euphoria has lifted Wall Street to record highs but evisceration of the Fed’s backstop powers before the pandemic is over threatens to destabilise parts of the credit system. The US Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, has told the Fed that he will not roll over five of its nine Great Depression powers under the Article 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act. There will be a suspension of its lending facilities for companies, local governments, and ‘Main Street’ loans at the end of the year. World The Telegraph Vatican launches inquiry after Pope Francis' Instagram account 'likes' Brazilian bikini model A Brazilian bikini model has joked that she is “going to heaven” after a photograph of her in a skimpy schoolgirl outfit was ‘liked’ by the official Instagram account of Pope Francis. The Vatican has launched an investigation into how the papal Instagram account, Franciscus, ended up ‘liking’ the risqué image of Natalia Garibotto. Vatican officials want to know how the embarrassing endorsement happened, amid speculation that someone in the Holy See’s communications team may have accidentally pressed the ‘like’ button while browsing the model’s extensive gallery of images. The photograph in question shows 27-year-old Miss Garibotto standing in front of a school locker, wearing a cropped white shirt and a revealing tartan skirt.

Lockdowns, job losses, school closures and dwindling income from the coronavirus have seen women take on significantly greater shares of housework and childcare. Employment and education opportunities are likely to be lost and women may suffer from poorer mental and physical health. ""Everything we worked for, that has taken 25 years, could be lost in a year,"" the UN Women deputy executive director Anita Bhatia told the BBC. Women's new burden of care posed a ""real risk of reverting to 1950s gender stereotypes"", she said. Celebrity The Independent Dolly Parton’s politics hide in plain sight, whether she admits it or not There’s not much room for ambiguity in our times, as some Hollywood stars have found out, yet Parton’s philanthropy, which includes her funding of a Covid-19 vaccine, means she gets a free pass. But it’s easy to read between the lines, says Adam White Lifestyle The Telegraph 'Not having to pay a mortgage is a huge freedom': the tiny homes making a big difference In March, Ikea unveiled its latest project. Tiny Home, made in partnership with Escape Homes and Vox Creative, was designed after a “shared commitment to sustainability, inclusivity and innovation” was discovered. Measuring just 187 sq ft, the “Boho XL” model had solar panels, a composting lavatory and on-demand heated water supply. It was an huge online success, but as far as tiny houses go, the Swedish furniture giant was actually late to the small living trend. Construction of miniature buildings skyrocketed in 2016, when it was estimated that more than 8,000 homes built in England measured smaller than 400 sq ft. Hailed for their eco-friendly and sustainable design features, the builds were an instant hit with millennials shut out of the housing market because of inflation, and with the climate conscious. It was the beginning of a movement that would inspire multiple disciplines, from carpentry with reclaimed wood to second-hand rattan furniture. And research has confirmed that tiny living is best for the planet. According to a UN report, conducted by the International Resource Panel, people should consider moving to tiny homes in order to fight climate change. “Limiting the growth in the size of our homes, and sharing rides and vehicles, turned out to be the most effective ways to reduce emissions,” said the report’s lead author, Edgar Hertwich, international chair in industrial ecology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. If buying your own flatbed and getting started seems a little daunting, take heart; making the switch isn’t as hard as you might think.

Doug Band, who worked for Mr Clinton for around two decades, claimed the former president flew on Epstein's jet dozens of times and visited the convicted sex offender's private Carribean island in January 2003. Although ignorant of Epstein's crimes at the time, Mr Band claimed in an interview with Vanity Fair that he attempted to keep his boss away from the financier after a 2002 trip to Africa. Mr Band told the magazine the trip had left him with a bad impression of Epstein and he advised Mr Clinton to end his relationship with the multimillionaire financier. The two men were friends in the 2000s, with Mr Clinton taking several trips on Epstein’s private jet, which has come to be known as the ""Lolita express"" after it was alleged that the financier used the jet to traffic underage girls between his various properties.

Business The Telegraph Nine Essex oil traders made $660m when prices plunged into the red Nine independent traders operating from their homes in Essex made $660m (£500m) in a single day of trading oil futures when prices briefly went negative earlier this year. The traders, all affiliated with the small trading firm Vega Capital London, hit the jackpot by capitalising on complex oil market mechanisms to sell oil contracts on falling prices and buy with prices as low as minus $37. Aristos ""Ari"" Demetriou, 31; Elliot Pickering, 25, and Connor Younger, 22, pocketed more than $100m each, according to reports, even as other investors lost millions as prices fell. Their success has caught the eye of regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington DC who are examining Vega Capital according to Bloomberg, which first reported their profits. Vega, said to have been founded in 2016 by friends Adrian Spires and Tommy Gaunt, did not respond to a request for comment by The Telegraph. A lawyer for several of the traders told Bloomberg they vehemently deny any wrongdoing and traded based on ""blaring"" market signals. Oil markets descended into chaos in April when coronavirus lockdowns forced planes to stop flying and people to stay at home, generating a slump in demand and a major supply glut. With oil storage space running out and traders about to be forced to take delivery of thousands of barrels of oil due to contract deadlines, traders were effectively paying people to take oil off their hands. US crude oil futures contracts collapsed on April 20 - the crunch day for contract deadlines - closing that day at minus $37.63. It was a record low and the first time prices had gone negative. Although the price did not remain at that level for long, the “unprecedented and unreal” situation provided an opportunity for traders who could use the price differences to their advantage. With warnings of negative prices made in early April, the Essex-based traders had contracts by April 20 to buy oil at a price that turned out to be negative, and had already sold separate contracts on which they also made a profit. Regulators may be considering whether their tactics simply aimed to anticipate price falls or tried to create them, which could be regarded as market manipulation. The CFTC did not responded to a request for comment on Friday. It has not accused the traders of any wrongdoing, nor have other regulators. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority was also reported in August to be looking into the trades. It declined to comment.

The Gloucester-born musician, born Tahliah Debrett Barnet, is suing the Transformers star for sexual battery, assault, and infliction of emotional distress. At the heart of the lawsuit, filed this week at Los Angeles Superior Court, is an incident at a petrol station in February of last year. The couple was driving through the desert during the middle of an argument, when Mr LaBeouf is said to have begun driving recklessly, before removing his seatbelt and threatening to crash unless Ms Barnet professed her love for him.

World The Telegraph Exclusive: Alarming new evidence on Coronavirus mutation could bring tougher restrictions An emergency toughening of Covid restrictions could be announced as soon as Saturday after Boris Johnson was handed alarming new evidence of the transmissibility of a mutant strain of the virus. The Prime Minister called an unscheduled meeting of senior ministers on Friday night to discuss how to contain the new variant, which has so far been largely confined to London and the South East. Travel restrictions are among the measures under discussion, with one source suggesting the Government could even restrict travel between the South East and other parts of the country. An alternative would be to ban commuters from travelling into London, after the mutant strain, which originated in Kent, spread rapidly to London and then the home counties.

Jeane Freeman said the sales are notoriously crowded and nothing on offer is worth the risk of catching the virus. Her intervention was backed by Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, who admitted it would not be popular with hard-pressed retailers. The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) hit back, saying the industry had spent £40 million to ensure ""shopping is as safe as possible"". David Lonsdale, the trade body's director, said there was ""little evidence shoppers have surged onto the high street"" when lockdowns have been lifted and warned that ""without customers many high street shops will wither away.""
