Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Bank of Canada will maintain current level of policy rate until inflation objective is achieved, continues its quantitative easing program FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations 613-782-8782 Ottawa, Ontario December 9, 2020 Available as: PDF The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week. The rebound in the global and Canadian economies has unfolded largely as the Bank had anticipated in its October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). More recently, news on the development of effective vaccines is providing reassurance that the pandemic will end and more normal activities will resume, although the pace and breadth of the global rollout of vaccinations remain uncertain. Near term, new waves of infections are expected to set back recoveries in many parts of the world. Accommodative policy and financial conditions are continuing to provide support across most regions. Stronger demand is pushing up prices for most commodities, including oil. A broad-based decline in the US exchange rate has contributed to a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar. In Canada, national accounts data for the third quarter were consistent with the Bank’s expectations of a sharp economic rebound following the precipitous decline in the second quarter. The labour market continues to recoup the jobs that were lost at the start of the pandemic, albeit at a slower pace. However, activity remains highly uneven across different sectors and groups of workers. Economic momentum heading into the fourth quarter appears to be stronger than was expected in October but, in recent weeks, record high cases of COVID-19 in many parts of Canada are forcing re-imposition of restrictions. This can be expected to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2021 and contribute to a choppy trajectory until a vaccine is widely available. The federal government’s recently announced measures should help maintain business and household incomes during this second wave of the pandemic and support the recovery. CPI inflation in October picked up to 0.7 percent, largely reflecting higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables. While this suggests a slightly firmer track for inflation in the fourth quarter, the outlook for inflation remains in line with the October MPR projection. Measures of core inflation are all below 2 percent, and considerable economic slack is expected to continue to weigh on inflation for some time. Canada’s economic recovery will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In our October projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway and will adjust it as required to help bring inflation back to target on a sustainable basis. We remain committed to providing the monetary policy stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is January 20, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time. Subsequent to the Bank’s previously announced review of the publication time of its interest rate announcements, the Bank re-confirms that it will remain at 10:00 (ET). As announced, starting in January the target for the overnight rate will take effect on the business day following each rate announcement.

The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a severe human and economic toll in Canada and around the world. The earlier-than anticipated arrival of effective vaccines will save lives and livelihoods, and has reduced uncertainty from extreme levels. Nevertheless, uncertainty is still elevated, and the outlook remains highly conditional on the path of the virus and the timeline for the effective rollout of vaccines. The economic recovery has been interrupted in many countries as new waves of COVID-19 infections force governments to re-impose containment measures. However, the arrival of effective vaccines combined with further fiscal and monetary policy support have boosted the medium-term outlook for growth. In its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the Bank projects global growth to average just over 5 percent per year in 2021 and 2022, before slowing to just under 4 percent in 2023. Global financial markets and commodity prices have reacted positively to improving economic prospects. A broad-based decline in the US exchange rate combined with stronger commodity prices have led to a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar. Canada’s economy had strong momentum through to late 2020, but the resurgence of cases and the reintroduction of lockdown measures are a serious setback. Growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to be negative. Assuming restrictions are lifted later in the first quarter, the Bank expects a strong second-quarter rebound. Consumption is forecast to gain strength as parts of the economy reopen and confidence improves, and exports and business investment will be buoyed by rising foreign demand. Beyond the near term, the outlook for Canada is now stronger and more secure than in the October projection, thanks to earlier-than-expected availability of vaccines and significant ongoing policy stimulus. After a decline in real GDP of 5 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank projects the economy will grow by 4 percent in 2021, almost 5 percent in 2022, and around 2 ½ percent in 2023. CPI inflation has risen to the low end of the Bank’s 1-3 percent target range in recent months, while measures of core inflation are still below 2 percent. CPI inflation is forecast to rise temporarily to around 2 percent in the first half of the year, as the base-year effects of price declines at the pandemic’s outset — mostly gasoline — dissipate. Excess supply is expected to weigh on inflation throughout the projection period. As it is absorbed, inflation is expected to return sustainably to the 2 percent target in 2023. In view of the weakness of near-term growth and the protracted nature of the recovery, the Canadian economy will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In our projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway. As the Governing Council gains confidence in the strength of the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted as required. We remain committed to providing the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is March 10, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on April 21, 2021.

Watch Governor Macklem speak at a virtual event hosted by the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce and the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. Read the full speech. The effects of COVID-19 have been deep and uneven All Canadians are affected by COVID-19, but workers in some industries have fared much worse than others. The biggest job losses have been in service industries where physical distancing is hardest, such as accommodation, food services, arts, entertainment and recreation. And the workers in those industries—mostly women and youth—tend to be low-income earners. The second wave of the virus further hurt women and youth. Both groups have seen their share of the long-term unemployed—people out of work for at least 26 weeks—rise more quickly than others have. As more people are vaccinated and normal life returns, the Canadian economy will strengthen. But a complete recovery in the labour market will take a long time. A complete recovery is a shared recovery—shared by working women and men of all ages across Canada."" Check out what the Bank is doing to support a shared economic recovery. The post-pandemic economy will be different Even though vaccines promise a lasting recovery, the economy won’t be the same as before COVID-19. New technologies were already changing how we live and work, and the pandemic has sped up those changes: The rise of online shopping means fewer in-store retail workers may be needed in the future. Many Canadians who have been working remotely will likely keep doing so, which would reduce demand for office space, transportation and restaurants. Demand for workers with digital skills will likely keep rising. At the same time, some of the jobs lost in the pandemic won’t return, as more tasks are automated and industries are reshaped. Technological change is usually good for workers and the economy in the long run. Giving people and businesses tools to be more productive eventually leads to more jobs and higher wages. At first, though, the groups of workers hit hardest by COVID-19 may continue to struggle. Some businesses and some jobs will not return either because of permanent changes in demand or the adoption of new technologies. So, we can expect a long adjustment process."" A shared recovery is good for everyone The more the recovery is shared, the more we can limit damage to people’s careers and lifetime earnings from being out of work for long periods. Such damage can hold back the economy, making it harder for wages and living standards to rise for everyone. So everyone has a stake in ensuring Canadians can adapt to change and share in the recovery: Workers should think about the digital skills and training they may need for future jobs. Schools should prepare children for a digital future, and colleges and universities should build digital skills into courses in every field. Businesses play a key role in digital-skills training. This could include pairing younger employees with older colleagues who may not be as familiar with new technologies. Governments could boost access to child care to help more women join the workforce. As well, programs that help match workers with employers will be increasingly important. The Bank of Canada has an important role, too. By keeping borrowing costs low for businesses and households, we make it easier for companies to invest in both workers and technology. Monetary policy can continue to support demand in order to minimize scarring and bring as many people into the work force as possible.""

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Bank of Canada will hold current level of policy rate until inflation objective is sustainably achieved, continues quantitative easing FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations 613-782-8782 Ottawa, Ontario March 10, 2021 Available as: PDF The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion per week. The global economy is recovering from the economic effects of COVID-19, albeit with ongoing unevenness across regions and sectors. The US economic recovery appears to be gaining momentum as virus infections decline and fiscal support boosts incomes and consumption. New fiscal stimulus will increase US consumption and output growth further. Global yield curves have steepened, largely reflecting the improved US growth outlook, but global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Oil and other commodity prices have risen. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable against the US dollar, but has appreciated against most other currencies. In Canada, the economy is proving to be more resilient than anticipated to the second wave of the virus and the associated containment measures. Although activity in hard-to-distance sectors continues to be held back, recent data point to continued recovery in the rest of the economy. GDP grew 9.6% in the final quarter of 2020, led by strong inventory accumulation. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to be positive, rather than the contraction forecast in January. Consumers and businesses are adapting to containment measures, and housing market activity has been much stronger than expected. Improving foreign demand and higher commodity prices have also brightened the prospects for exports and business investment. Despite the stronger near-term outlook, there is still considerable economic slack and a great deal of uncertainty about the evolution of the virus and the path of economic growth. The labour market is a long way from recovery, with employment still well below pre-COVID levels. Low-wage workers, young people and women have borne the brunt of the job losses. The spread of more transmissible variants of the virus poses the largest downside risk to activity, as localized outbreaks and restrictions could restrain growth and add choppiness to the recovery. CPI inflation is near the bottom of the 1-3 percent target band but is likely to move temporarily to around the top of the band in the next few months. The expected rise in CPI inflation reflects base-year effects from deep price declines in some goods and services at the outset of the crisis a year ago, combined with higher gasoline prices pushed up by the recent run-up in oil prices. CPI inflation is then expected to moderate as base-year effects dissipate and excess capacity continues to exert downward pressure. Measures of core inflation currently range from 1.3 to 2 percent. While economic prospects have improved, the Governing Council judges that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s January projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway. As the Governing Council continues to gain confidence in the strength of the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted as required. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 21, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Joint Statement of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada on the Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario October 24, 2016 Available as: PDF The primary objective of Canada's monetary policy is to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canadians by contributing to sustained economic growth, rising levels of employment and improved living standards. Experience has clearly shown that the best way monetary policy can achieve this goal is by maintaining a low and stable inflation environment, which preserves confidence in the value of money. Twenty-five years ago, in 1991, Canada adopted an inflation-targeting framework to guide its monetary policy. During this time, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has been reduced and maintained at a level of close to 2 per cent, with no persistent episodes of inflation outside of the 1-to-3 per cent inflation-control range. Real output has expanded at an average rate of close to 2 1/2 per cent per year and the performance of the labour market has been better. In addition, there has been much lower volatility in inflation, real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and interest rates. This improved macroeconomic performance has been fostered by the joint commitment of the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada to the inflation target, which has helped to anchor inflation expectations and provided a more stable economic environment in which Canadians can plan their investment and spending decisions. Over the past decade, the global economy has undergone significant economic and financial shocks. Monetary authorities have dramatically extended the limits of their policy toolkits to combat persistent weakness, guard against deflation, repair financial system functioning, and restore confidence. Given such challenges, monetary policy frameworks have themselves come under intense scrutiny. Throughout this period, the Bank of Canada's flexible inflation targeting framework has continued to demonstrate its value. The well-established credibility of this framework has reinforced the Canadian public's confidence that monetary policy will continue to achieve the inflation target, and helped underpin the Canadian economy through challenging times. These benefits continue to be evident in the wake of the global commodity price shock, enabling monetary policy to support the complex adjustment in the Canadian economy while maintaining overall price stability. Based on this experience, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada agree to renew the inflation target on the following basis: The target will continue to be defined in terms of the 12-month rate of change in the total CPI. The inflation target will continue to be the 2 per cent mid-point of the 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range. The agreement will run for another five-year period, ending 31 December 2021. The Bank will continue its research into potential improvements in the monetary policy framework. Before the end of 2021, the Government and the Bank will review the experience over the five-year period, as well as any research insights, and determine the appropriate framework for the years ahead. The commitment by the Government and the Bank to this inflation-control target will ensure that Canadians continue to derive the economic and social benefits from low, stable and predictable inflation and underpin confidence in Canada's economic prospects in the coming years.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Toward 2021: Renewing the Monetary Policy Framework Toward 2021: Outreach Let's Talk Inflation Toward 2021: Consultations with Canadians In 2021, the Bank of Canada and the federal government will renew the agreement on Canada’s monetary policy framework. To inform our discussions, the Bank conducted a broad range of public outreach activities between 2019 and 2021. This report summarizes our findings. We would like to thank the thousands of Canadians who took the time to offer their views throughout these consultations. At the Bank, we are committed to accountability and transparency in everything we do. The actions we take and how well we do our work affects the lives of every Canadian.” Tiff Macklem, Governor Time for renewal Every five years, the Bank and the Government of Canada review and renew the agreement on the Bank’s monetary policy framework. This agreement will be renewed in 2021. In the years leading up to each renewal, the Bank conducts extensive research and consults experts on key issues affecting the conduct of monetary policy. For the 2021 renewal, we broadened our outreach activities to include a larger number of individual Canadians and public interest groups. We did so for several reasons: For the first time in 30 years, we are comparing the inflation-targeting framework with several alternatives: average inflation targeting a dual mandate, targeting both inflation and employment nominal gross domestic product (GDP) targeting price-level targeting Since the global financial crisis in 2008, central banks have implemented extraordinary policies and used a variety of new tools. This increased activity has put central banks in the public eye more than ever before. Public outreach is a key opportunity for central banks to assess the economic environment, gather input and ensure their policies and decisions reflect the views of the people they serve. This, in turn, reinforces public trust. Gathering a more diverse range of views on the Bank’s activities, frameworks and decisions ultimately leads to better policy outcomes. Listening to Canadians Clear and timely communications matter when conducting monetary policy. Whichever approach we adopt for our framework, it will be more effective if Canadians understand it well. Consider inflation targeting, for example: when inflation remains close to its 2 percent target for a long time, people start to expect it to stay there. This expectation helps all Canadians plan their purchases, investments, salary requirements and budgets—and what results is a feedback loop that helps tie inflation to its target. Four goals guided our consultations. We wanted to: gain a better understanding of the concerns Canadians currently have about the economy and economic policy learn how our existing inflation-targeting framework affects different groups of Canadians and how the alternative approaches being considered might affect those groups assess how well people understand the different monetary policy frameworks and their trade-offs gauge people’s awareness, understanding and support of unconventional policy tools What we did To gather this broader input, we extended our public outreach activities to include: surveys, including a comprehensive online public consultation (see Appendix 1) focus groups, including a multi-week online community conversation (see Appendix 2) round-table discussions with civil society, labour and business groups (see Appendix 3) open invitations for written submissions (see Appendix 4) We reached out to Canadians of all ages across the country and conducted these activities in person—before the COVID‑19 pandemic—and online. Appendix 5 provides additional information about our consultations with economists and policy experts. What we heard The current economy and the Bank We learned that Canadians’ trust in the Bank and the financial system remained steady or increased slightly during the COVID‑19 pandemic. That said, people have clearly become more concerned about the future health of the economy and their finances. In particular, focus group participants voiced concerns about the costs of urban housing: rising far beyond the 2 percent inflation target growing faster than wages These growing costs, they said, make it much harder for people to become homeowners. As a result, they felt this widens the divide between the rich and the poor, which negatively affects social cohesion. Other respondents worry about: high levels of household debt and the cost of housing job insecurity wealth inequality They said that they have shifted their purchasing habits away from discretionary spending and toward buying only essentials. These respondents felt that having an inflation target that maintains the inflation rate at a manageable level provides more certainty for both short- and long-term budgeting. Across all our consultation activities, some people indicated they are unfamiliar with the Bank’s work and mandate but appreciated the opportunity to learn and participate. Indeed, many said they’d like to see us do more to educate Canadians about our work. Unprompted, some representatives from organizations in our round-table discussions expressed concerns about the undermining of central bank independence. They stressed the importance of the Bank’s independence given the current environment, where there is a growing perception that central banks are being influenced by political considerations. Some also raised concerns about the impact of climate change on low-income households, specifically in terms of recovery from natural disasters, such as tornadoes or flooding. They explicitly stated that the Bank should choose a framework that best supports climate change mitigation and the transition to clean energy. Perceptions of inflation A lot of Canadians have confidence in the Bank’s ability to keep inflation on target. Across all demographics (including age, gender, income and level of education), most people said they would prefer to have stable and predictable inflation so they can plan their budget. Others were more specific and said they wanted to prepare for retirement and generate wealth. Overall, people generally worried about rising costs and felt that those who live on fixed incomes, low-wage earners and seniors are most affected by rising inflation. Many felt that the 2 percent target does not accurately represent inflation, pointing to the prices of numerous goods and services that have increased by more than that in recent years. People see inflation mostly in: their grocery and restaurant bills the costs of household operations—such as utility bills and furnishings transportation costs Participants in focus groups and round-table discussions told us that the consumer price index (CPI) does not effectively capture the: rising costs of certain goods and services—for example, food prices in remote communities and education costs growth in housing prices across the country Many questioned how CPI is calculated. They asked whether the particular goods and services used to measure inflation and the demographic of an average Canadian were still relevant. Appendix 6 describes how we explored consumers’ perceptions of inflation. Monetary policy frameworks Inflation targeting Overall, most people we heard from supported the continued use of inflation targeting as the Bank’s approach to monetary policy. They recognized that a targeted range for inflation: works well for different economic situations allows for a smoother adjustment in interest rates over a longer time period Most respondents also said they would prefer an approach that balances the level of interest rates to benefit both savers and borrowers. Additionally, the majority viewed inflation targeting as the most easily understood approach. Most people knew that inflation targeting helps keep the prices of goods and services under control. And the majority intuitively understood the relationship between inflation and interest rates. A significant proportion of participants were aware that the Bank targets inflation and sets the key interest rate. Canadians reported that they believe we have achieved the inflation target in the past and were highly confident that we can do so in the future. But fewer understand why the target is set at 2 percent. Many people said they would like the Bank to spend more time discussing economic issues that matter to working people, including how monetary policy can influence the evolving labour market. Labour groups, as well as some civil society organizations, academics and parliamentarians, supported adding an additional objective to our monetary policy framework: targeting full employment. Another theme that emerged from round-table discussions and focus groups was the concern about the growing gap between the “haves” and the “have nots.” Some participants emphasized that monetary policy can have an impact on economic inequality and social cohesion. However, they noted that it is not achieving its full potential because it is not reaching some parts of the economy. Examples that people pointed to include remote and Northern communities where prices are disproportionately high and fluctuating, as well as Indigenous Peoples who face challenges associated with access to credit. In contrast, others said we shouldn’t focus on any specific group when making interest rate decisions. The majority of people we heard from preferred that the Bank be flexible. They were most comfortable with an approach that targets a range for inflation and adjusts monetary policy gradually to achieve that target. Further, when given a choice between having us maintain the inflation-targeting approach or shift our focus to economic growth or full employment, a large number chose inflation targeting. They worried that other factors beyond the Bank’s control could affect the Bank’s ability to successfully achieve these alternative objectives. Alternative approaches When asked to identify an alternative framework that they thought was better than the Bank’s current approach, people questioned how: easily a change in the monetary policy framework could occur achievable it might be significantly Canadians might be affected by it They also asked why the Bank is considering a change in approach now and how the decision would be made. Nevertheless, people saw value in the alternative frameworks—in particular, average inflation targeting and the dual mandate. Most felt both of these concepts were relatively easy to understand. Nominal GDP targeting and price-level targeting were the least favoured options. This is likely because they were harder to relate to compared with the other two and were considered more difficult for the Bank to achieve. Average inflation targeting Overall, many suggested that average inflation targeting offers the Bank greater flexibility and allows the economy to recover faster from a downturn, which was a perceived benefit. Canadians felt a greater sense of trust that this framework would maintain stable prices. However, some reported concerns about how longer periods of high or low inflation could affect them and the affordability of day-to-day items during these “make-up” periods. Dual mandate A dual mandate—targeting both inflation and full employment—was seen as another good option for the Bank. However, in our focus groups, many participants didn’t fully grasp the connection between employment and inflation, although they generally supported the idea of targeting both to encourage job growth. Many participants appreciated the flexibility a dual mandate could offer and liked the idea of a sustained and healthy job market. In particular, labour group members viewed access to stable employment and a livable wage as most important and relevant for Canadians and favoured this approach. That said, many people were skeptical about whether full employment could be reached, given that other factors beyond the Bank’s control could affect job market conditions. Some people also struggled to understand how changing interest rates could affect hiring and what types of jobs would be created (minimum-wage versus high-paying). They worried about whether inflation would rise too high and reduce the purchasing power of their wages if employment became the focal point. Interestingly, a dual mandate was the most polarizing option in our online consultations and focus group discussions: Some respondents questioned the effectiveness of a dual mandate in a situation such as the COVID‑19 pandemic, where the higher unemployment rate is due to containment measures and lockdowns. They believed there was little that monetary policy could do in such circumstances. Others felt it would be appropriate to target both inflation and employment because it would help ensure a healthy job market, especially in circumstances like a pandemic. Some participants thought it might go a step too far and cause the Bank to become influenced by political considerations. Unconventional tools Our policy tool kit is a critical part of our monetary policy framework. It provides a range of instruments that can be implemented in extraordinary circumstances, such as when the key interest rate is at its lowest, to keep the economy stable. Since the onset of the COVID‑19 crisis, the Bank has been purchasing government bonds as part of its quantitative easing (QE) program. This program: aims to make longer-term borrowing cheaper for businesses and households signals that interest rates are set to stay lower for a longer period In our cross-Canada online public consultation, we asked about the Bank’s QE activities. Just over half of respondents said they were aware that the Bank has been conducting these large-scale purchases to help the economy during the pandemic. The majority supported this approach and felt the Bank should continue making these purchases as needed. Almost two-thirds of participants thought it was a good idea for the Bank to: indicate that interest rates will remain low during the pandemic provide general guidance around the future path of interest rates However, almost three-quarters of respondents opposed the use of negative interest rates when the economy is in trouble. What we learned Low and stable inflation is a priority Overall, Canadians support low and stable inflation. They recognize that it: helps keep the prices of goods and services under control allows them to plan for the future contributes to overall economic stability—which many people value Not everyone we heard from was familiar with the inflation target and how it’s achieved—but after this approach was explained, it seemed to be the easiest to understand and relate to. That said, many participants questioned how inflation is measured because the reported rate of inflation does not appear to reflect everyone’s experience. More relatable communication Numerous respondents noted that we could better communicate about our work by providing more engaging and real-life examples of how our decisions can affect different groups of Canadians. Suggestions included: using more relevant examples that show how the Bank’s decisions affect people in different stages of life as well as the prices of everyday products and big-ticket items providing web-based tools to help Canadians calculate what different inflation rates can mean for their personal circumstances Openness to change Regarding alternative approaches for monetary policy, most participants appreciated the flexibility that both the dual mandate and average inflation targeting frameworks offer. People were receptive to longer periods of higher or lower inflation to support economic recovery or to retain a healthy job market. However, they voiced concerns about how this would affect their personal finances, particularly in the long run. While many respondents considered average inflation targeting to be feasible, they doubted the Bank’s ability to implement a dual mandate. Generally, when given the choice between the Bank’s current inflation-targeting approach and an alternative framework, most opted for our existing approach. Participants perceived it to be easy to understand and the most achievable option, given the Bank’s tools. Unusual but appropriate measures In terms of unconventional tools, respondents generally support the Bank’s current quantitative easing program and our general guidance around the future path of interest rates. Most agreed that we should signal that interest rates will remain low during the pandemic. However, an even greater proportion of participants opposed the use of negative interest rates if the economy was in trouble. Appendix 1: Surveys Annual Public Awareness survey Methodology: online survey, administered by a large polling firm on behalf of the Bank of Canada Timing: annually, in February or March, with pulse-checks later in the year Number of participants: approximately 2,200 for the annual survey and 1,000 for the pulse checks Demographics: nationally representative This annual survey aims to explore Canadians’ views about the economy and the Bank. Several questions relate to the renewal of the Bank’s monetary policy framework. In the February 2020 survey: 53% of respondents trust the Bank to ensure Canada’s financial system functions well 46% trust the Bank to maintain a low and stable inflation rate 49% trust the Bank to contribute to the successful management of the economy Pulse-checks In light of the COVID‑19 pandemic, two short pulse-check surveys were added in 2020: in May, after the onset of the pandemic, and in September, when the country was settling in for the long haul. The May and September results revealed shifts in public opinion. Today versus tomorrow Canadians with positive perceptions of the current state of the economy February 2020 48% May 2020 17% September 2020 25% Respondents who believe the state of the economy will improve in the future February 2020 22% May 2020 32% September 2020 29% When asked about their current financial situation, in September 50% of respondents said it was “good” and another 26% said it was “average” or “about the same.” However, people felt differently about their future financial state: 22% thought it would improve 60% thought it would remain about the same Growing interest Share of respondents who believed the Bank’s decisions affect their lives February 2020 48% May 2020 56% September 2020 57% Share of respondents who are interested in economic news and analysis February 2020 39% May 2020 48% September 2020 47% Trust in the system Canadians with pride and confidence in the banking system February 2020 45% May 2020 50% September 2020 55% Canadians who are confident that the financial system is safe and secure February 2020 47% May 2020 50% September 2020 53% Belief in the Bank Share of Canadians who express overall trust in the Bank February 2020 48% May 2020 48% September 2020 50% Share of Canadians who believe that the Bank is doing a good job at controlling inflation February 2020 39% May 2020 50% September 2020 52% Share of Canadians who believe that the Bank is doing a good job at helping stabilize the economy February 2020 N/A May 2020 43% September 2020 46% Percentage of Canadians who are aware that the Bank cut its key interest rate to support the economy February 2020 N/A May 2020 60% September 2020 52% About 22% of respondents were aware that the Bank is buying government bonds and 58% were in favour of this action. Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations Methodology: online survey, administered by a large polling firm on behalf of the Bank Timing: quarterly, in February, May, August and November Number of participants: approximately 2,000 heads of households Demographics: nationally representative sample of adult residents of Canada aged 18 or older This survey gathers Canadians’ views on: inflation the labour market household finances topical issues of interest In late 2019, we added several questions to the survey to assess the public’s knowledge of the Bank’s inflation-targeting framework. 94% of respondents said it was “somewhat important” or “very important” that Canada have low and stable inflation 62% said the Bank is responsible for inflation targeting, but only 35% of respondents knew that an inflation target exists 74% knew the Bank sets the key interest rate in Canada 85% said the Bank has achieved its inflation target in the past “some of the time” or “most of the time” 88% said the Bank would achieve its inflation target in the future “some of the time” or “most of the time” Let’s Talk Inflation public consultation Methodology: online survey, administered by an online engagement firm on behalf of the Bank Timing: August to September 2020 Number of participants: more than 8,500 Canadians from across the country Demographics: 70% were male; 46% were between the ages of 25 and 44 Canadians were invited to share their financial concerns and their views about the: economy Bank of Canada inflation-targeting framework Views on inflation 55% said that 2% is an unrealistic inflation target, and 66% think inflation in Canada is higher than that 56% worry “a lot” about the rising cost of goods and services, while 35% said they worry “somewhat” about this 80% said they favour a targeted range for inflation rather than a fixed target 67% said they prefer a slower return to the 2% target, with smoother adjustments in interest rates over a longer period of time, instead of sharp, rapid changes to the interest rate 53% said having stable and predictable inflation was most important, while other participants’ top priorities were: steady economic growth (27%) maximum sustainable employment (20%) Alternative approaches Participants also shared their thoughts on alternative approaches to the Bank’s current monetary policy framework. Inflation targeting was ranked the easiest to understand, followed by the dual mandate, average inflation targeting, price-level targeting and nominal gross domestic product (GDP) targeting. Average inflation targeting Around 80% of respondents said average inflation targeting was easy or somewhat easy to understand. Slightly more than 40% said it would be easy or somewhat easy to achieve. When asked if it would be better than the Bank’s current approach, participants were almost equally split across “Yes,” “No” and “I don’t know” responses. Dual mandate About 80% said the dual mandate was easy or somewhat easy to understand, but: almost 60% felt it would be difficult to achieve nearly 40% didn’t think it would be an improvement over the current framework Nominal GDP growth targeting While 70% said nominal GDP growth targeting was easy or somewhat easy to understand, 54% thought it would be difficult or somewhat difficult to achieve. Close to 50% said it would not be a better option than the current framework. Price-level targeting Results for price-level targeting were mixed: 76% said it was easy or somewhat easy to understand, and 62% said it would be difficult or somewhat difficult to achieve. When asked whether it would be better than the current framework: almost 40% said no only 30% said yes 32% said they didn’t know Unconventional tools On negative interest rates: 73% did not think that the Bank should consider negative interest rates if the economy was in trouble On quantitative easing: 75% said they were aware that the Bank has been buying large amounts of government bonds 45% said the Bank should consider quantitative easing to target longer-term interest rates On forward guidance: 67% said giving an interest rate signal is a good idea Appendix 2: Focus groups 2019: In-person and online discussions Methodology: six in-person focus groups in three large cities (Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver) and two online sessions with people living in medium- and small-population centres as well as rural areas, administered by a large polling firm on behalf of the Bank Timing: November and December 2019 Number of participants: approximately 60 participants in the in-person focus groups and close to 40 participants in online discussions Demographics: not available In 2019, the Bank of Canada commissioned focus groups in person and online with Canadians across the country to gain a better understanding of: how different socio-economic groups experience inflation the general awareness, knowledge and perceptions of our current inflation-targeting framework how changes to the framework could affect different segments of the Canadian population Participants were asked to list some of their biggest concerns about the economy. In general, most focused on: cost of living (including prices of goods and services, bills, debt, mortgages) wages wealth inequality financial well-being When asked what they think of when they hear the word “inflation,” respondents stated: “Rising pressure on us [citizens] to provide more services for people who are left behind by wages that are not keeping up with living costs.” “The cost of everyday necessities going up while my wages stay stagnant.” “Inflation is a major concern to me. I am retired and worry about outliving my savings as everything gets more expensive.” Participants were also asked about Canada’s inflation target. Those who were familiar with the target said it helps to: keep the prices of goods and services under control allow for cost certainty for budgeting Those who were not familiar with the target assumed that it helps to stabilize the Canadian economy, ensure steady economic growth and incentivize consumer behaviour. Participants were shown a video explaining how inflation targeting works. Some understood the concept easily, but others had more difficulty: “Makes sense. If the targets are so high, we won’t be able to afford a lot of things. It would be like going back in time.” “I don’t understand how it can control the market. You can make the target 1 percent or 3 percent, but if tomorrow we don’t have supply [to meet demand], the price [of goods] is going up. You can do nothing.” “I don’t see how you can control inflation. If the Bank of Canada sets this target, how do they implement it?” Respondents had different opinions when asked whether inflation, as measured by Statistics Canada, is accurate. Many were confused about why the target is set at 2 percent. Some suggested that this is the target because that’s a manageable percentage; others suggested it was the “optimum rate” or “sweet spot.” “I view it as accurate because I don’t have any information to state otherwise.” “It doesn’t seem accurate. It seems costs, especially food, have risen more. No idea why it is set at 2 percent.” “The basket included things that you need daily, but it didn’t mention rental prices or house prices. Those have gone completely out of control.” When asked about inflation and employment, most struggled to explain the link. After receiving additional explanation, some were able to understand the concept better and even discussed the relationship between wages and economic performance. “If employment is too high (unemployment too low) that would cause higher inflation.” “Inflation is a sign of growth. More inflation means more growth in prices. If you have low unemployment that means more people are working and spending and that drives up prices.” Participants generally understood the relationship between interest rates and inflation. Most recognized that changes in the interest rate are related to changes in inflation. They also felt that a balance between interest rates and inflation would help stabilize the economy. A discussion of the benefits of setting an inflation target produced this comment: “If people can’t afford housing or food, that’s not good. It’s about social cohesion, and we can see that in other countries around the world.” In contrast, when talking about drawbacks to setting a target: “There are none that I can think of, other than setting a bad target.” “Wages will stagnate.” When offered a choice between maintaining the inflation target or shifting the focus to growth or full employment, most preferred keeping the existing target. 2021: Online community Methodology: weekly online engagement exercise on a moderated platform, administered by a large polling firm on behalf of the Bank Timing: January 2021 Number of participants: approximately 200 participants each week Demographics: more than 50% of respondents were women, and the majority of participants were over 50 years old In January 2021, we commissioned an online-based community engagement exercise to gather insights on whether the proposed communications on some of the alternative frameworks being considered were understandable and relatable. Simplified descriptions of each framework were prepared in both text and video formats, explaining: the overall framework why the Bank would choose this option how it would affect Canadians Participants were asked to comment on the communications products and what they viewed as positive and negative about the frameworks presented: When asked why keeping inflation on target is important, the majority chose “To keep the economy stable and employment sustainable” as the top reason. Many participants stated that the current framework was the easiest to understand. Among the alternatives presented, average inflation targeting was easiest to understand because it is most similar to the current approach. However, participants wanted additional information on how it would affect the affordability of day-to-day items during the “make-up” periods. A dual mandate was the most polarizing of all the alternative frameworks. Some participants believed that focusing on employment in addition to inflation was relevant in the current climate. However, others were concerned that the benefits of full employment were less tangible. Overall, most participants found it difficult to understand how and if a dual mandate would work. They questioned how changes in inflation would encourage hiring and what types of jobs would be created. Many participants provided recommendations on how we could better communicate about our work and mandate by providing more relatable, engaging and real-life examples of how our decisions affect different groups of Canadians. They also suggested providing web-based tools to help Canadians calculate what different inflation rates can mean for their personal circumstances. Participants also wanted to better understand why the Bank is considering changing its monetary policy framework now, given that the current framework has been working well for more than 30 years. They also wanted to know why one framework is chosen over another. Participants consistently didn’t understand how the various frameworks would affect their personal finances or spending habits. That said, they did care about rising living costs, and many commented that wages and government benefits do not increase at the same rate. In terms of borrowing and spending, around 50 percent of respondents agreed that interest rates affect their decision-making process. Overall, people tended to prefer the video over text, particularly those who are visual learners. There was a general sense that the information was easier to understand in this format. However, most participants found both formats complemented each another. Many said they felt more informed about the economy and inflation—and the fact that there is a target—after reading the materials provided. However, some suggested the text could be more relatable and engaging if real-life examples or charts were provided. Appendix 3: Round-table discussions Methodology: in-person meetings, led by the Bank Timing: June to December 2019 Number of participants: 13 national civil society groups Demographics: not applicable In the second half of 2019, Bank of Canada staff met with 13 national civil society groups1 to discuss inflation and monetary policy as well as their particular economic priorities and concerns. These conversations took place before the COVID‑19 pandemic began. Although inflation was not the top issue for all groups, many were concerned about the rising prices of specific goods and services. Participants also commented on a range of other issues. Housing costs Many participants noted that higher housing prices are affecting labour market availability and social activities in major urban centres. Consumer price index Some groups said the consumer price index does not reflect their reality. Canadians experience inflation differently, depending on their financial circumstances or where they live. For example: Students said that tuition is rising more than 2 percent per year, and the prices of goods and services—including textbooks—are increasing at a much higher rate than inflation. At the same time, some student aid programs, such as Canada Student Loans, have a fixed allocation rate that has not increased since 2004. Other groups noted that Indigenous people in remote communities: pay more for their purchases have difficulty borrowing money pay high interest rates when they obtain loans Labour market Participants told us that by focusing only on inflation targeting, the Bank has overlooked structural shifts in the economy and the evolution of the labour market. For example: The appreciation of the exchange rate from 2002 to 2008 had a significant impact on Canada’s manufacturing sector. New structural changes, such as the gig economy and climate change, currently affect employment. Inequality One group reported that low interest rates have contributed to housing inflation. Access to affordable housing is critical for low-income earners and employers because wages are sensitive to housing costs. The low interest rate environment has also had a negative impact on pension plans. Climate change One group said the Bank has an important role to play in addressing climate change. Because the Bank is a trusted institution, its research and analysis can help foster public discussion about climate impacts and the search for solutions. The Bank’s mandate Attendees from non-labour, non-business organizations were unfamiliar with the Bank and monetary policy but expressed a desire to learn more about the Bank’s work. Central bank independence Without prompting, representatives from several organizations voiced their concerns about the Bank’s independence. They stressed its importance in the current environment, where there is a growing perception that central banks are being influenced by political interference. Appendix 4: Written submissions The Bank of Canada posted an open invitation on its website for Canadians to send formal submissions, such as official letters or papers, to express their views about the monetary policy framework and what they think the Bank’s priorities should be. We received seven submissions from various organizations, academics and economists, including: a note from Competition Bureau Canada’s Commissioner of Competition a submission from Greenpeace In their submissions, people shared their views on the country’s economic priorities and how those views align with the Bank’s current frameworks, tool kits and policies. They also provided their perspectives on what factors the Bank should consider during this review period. Appendix 5: Consultations with economists and policy experts In addition to consultations with the public, the Bank of Canada routinely conducts extensive policy research before the renewal of the monetary policy framework. For this renewal, the Bank: hosted conferences and invited experts from other central banks, universities and think tanks participated in a conference on the renewal hosted by McGill University researched and published staff papers—some with co-authors from other institutions—on alternative frameworks reviewed a letter signed by 61 Canadian economists urging the federal government to instruct the Bank of Canada to expand its monetary policy framework and consider not only inflation but also full employment when making interest rate decisions We also delivered presentations to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce and to new members of Parliament. Toward 2021: Renewing the Monetary Policy Framework presents the results of our research. Appendix 6: Inflation—perceptions versus reality Surveys conducted by the Bank of Canada show that many consumers perceive inflation to be higher than its measured level and its target. As part of the Bank’s research for the 2021 inflation-target renewal, we wanted to test the accuracy of this perception and to better understand it. The inflation rate that guides the Bank’s decisions is the consumer price index (CPI). Statistics Canada uses the CPI to track: how much the average Canadian household spends how household spending changes over time Using its Survey of Household Spending, Statistics Canada estimates what an average household includes in its “shopping basket.” This basket includes about 700 goods and services that Canadians typically buy. Working together, Statistics Canada and the Bank tested consumers’ perceptions that inflation is higher than the CPI. To do this, we constructed a shopping basket and inflation rate for different groupings of households based on: income education age whether they are renters or homeowners We found that the inflation rates constructed for specific consumer groupings were similar to the measured CPI inflation rate. Participants’ reactions to the Bank’s response to COVID‑19 indicated a slight but limited shift in this finding.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Bank of Canada will hold current level of policy rate until inflation objective is sustainably achieved, adjusts quantitative easing program FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario April 21, 2021 Available as: PDF The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank continues to provide extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate, reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program. Effective the week of April 26, weekly net purchases of Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted to a target of $3 billion. This adjustment to the amount of incremental stimulus being added each week reflects the progress made in the economic recovery. The outlook has improved for both the global and Canadian economies. Activity has proven more resilient than expected in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rollout of vaccines is progressing. A number of regions, including Canada, are experiencing a difficult third wave of infections and lockdowns. The more contagious variants of the virus are straining healthcare systems and affecting hard-to-distance activities, and have introduced a new dimension of uncertainty. The recovery remains highly dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the pace of vaccinations. Global economic growth is stronger than was forecast in the January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), although the pace varies considerably across countries. After a contraction of 2 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank now projects global GDP to grow by just over 6 ¾ percent in 2021, about 4 percent in 2022, and almost 3 ½ percent in 2023. The recovery in the United States has been particularly strong, owing to fiscal stimulus and rapid vaccine rollouts. The global recovery has lifted commodity prices, including oil, contributing to the strength of the Canadian dollar. In Canada, growth in the first quarter appears considerably stronger than the Bank’s January forecast, as households and companies adapted to the second wave and associated restrictions. Substantial job gains in February and March boosted employment. However, new lockdowns will pose another setback and the labour market remains difficult for many Canadians, especially low-wage workers, young people and women. As vaccines roll out and the economy reopens, consumption is expected to rebound strongly in the second half of this year and remain robust over the projection. Housing construction and resales are at historic highs, driven by the desire for more living space, low mortgage rates, and limited supply. The Bank will continue to monitor the potential risks associated with the rapid rise in house prices. Meanwhile, strong growth in foreign demand and higher commodity prices are expected to drive a robust recovery in exports and business investment. Additional federal and provincial fiscal stimulus will contribute importantly to growth. The Bank now forecasts real GDP growth of 6 ½ percent in 2021, moderating to around 3 ¾ percent in 2022 and 3 ¼ percent in 2023. The Bank has revised up its estimate of potential output in light of greater resilience to the pandemic and accelerated digitalization. The virus and lockdowns have had very different impacts across sectors, businesses, and groups of workers, creating an unusual degree of uncertainty about the amount of slack in the economy and how long it will take to be absorbed. To gauge the evolution of slack, the Bank will look at a broad spectrum of indicators, including various measures of labour market conditions. Over the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around the top of the 1-3 percent inflation-control range. This is largely the result of base-year effects—year-over-year CPI inflation is higher because prices of some goods and services fell sharply at the start of the pandemic. In addition, the increase in oil prices since December has driven gasoline prices above their pre-pandemic levels. The Bank expects CPI inflation to ease back toward 2 percent over the second half of 2021 as these base-year effects diminish, and inflation is expected to ease further because of the ongoing drag from excess capacity. As slack is absorbed, inflation should return to 2 per cent on a sustained basis some time in the second half of 2022. Even as economic prospects improve, the Governing Council judges that there is still considerable excess capacity, and the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on the Bank’s latest projection, this is now expected to happen some time in the second half of 2022. The Bank is continuing its QE program to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further adjustments to the pace of net purchases will be guided by Governing Council’s ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 9, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 14, 2021.

Global economic growth is stronger than was forecast in the January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), although the pace varies considerably across countries. After a contraction of 2 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank now projects global GDP to grow by just over 6 ¾ percent in 2021, about 4 percent in 2022, and almost 3 ½ percent in 2023. The recovery in the United States has been particularly strong, owing to fiscal stimulus and rapid vaccine rollouts. The global recovery has lifted commodity prices, including oil, contributing to the strength of the Canadian dollar. In Canada, growth in the first quarter appears considerably stronger than the Bank’s January forecast, as households and companies adapted to the second wave and associated restrictions. Substantial job gains in February and March boosted employment. However, new lockdowns will pose another setback and the labour market remains difficult for many Canadians, especially low-wage workers, young people and women. As vaccines roll out and the economy reopens, consumption is expected to rebound strongly in the second half of this year and remain robust over the projection. Housing construction and resales are at historic highs, driven by the desire for more living space, low mortgage rates, and limited supply. The Bank will continue to monitor the potential risks associated with the rapid rise in house prices. Meanwhile, strong growth in foreign demand and higher commodity prices are expected to drive a robust recovery in exports and business investment. Additional federal and provincial fiscal stimulus will contribute importantly to growth. The Bank now forecasts real GDP growth of 6 ½ percent in 2021, moderating to around 3 ¾ percent in 2022 and 3 ¼ percent in 2023. The Bank has revised up its estimate of potential output in light of greater resilience to the pandemic and accelerated digitalization. The virus and lockdowns have had very different impacts across sectors, businesses, and groups of workers, creating an unusual degree of uncertainty about the amount of slack in the economy and how long it will take to be absorbed. To gauge the evolution of slack, the Bank will look at a broad spectrum of indicators, including various measures of labour market conditions. Over the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around the top of the 1-3 percent inflation-control range. This is largely the result of base-year effects—year-over-year CPI inflation is higher because prices of some goods and services fell sharply at the start of the pandemic. In addition, the increase in oil prices since December has driven gasoline prices above their pre-pandemic levels. The Bank expects CPI inflation to ease back toward 2 percent over the second half of 2021 as these base-year effects diminish, and inflation is expected to ease further because of the ongoing drag from excess capacity. As slack is absorbed, inflation should return to 2 per cent on a sustained basis some time in the second half of 2022. Even as economic prospects improve, the Governing Council judges that there is still considerable excess capacity, and the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on the Bank’s latest projection, this is now expected to happen some time in the second half of 2022. The Bank is continuing its QE program to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further adjustments to the pace of net purchases will be guided by Governing Council’s ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 9, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 14, 2021.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Bank of Canada will hold current level of policy rate until inflation objective is sustainably achieved, continues quantitative easing FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario June 9, 2021 The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at a target pace of $3 billion per week. With COVID-19 cases falling in many countries and vaccine coverage rising, global economic activity is picking up. Growth remains uneven across regions, however. The US is experiencing a strong consumer-driven recovery and a rebound is beginning to take shape in Europe, while a resurgence of the virus is hampering the recovery in some emerging market economies. Financial conditions remain highly accommodative, reflected in broadly higher asset prices. Commodity prices have risen further, notably oil, and the Canadian dollar has seen a further appreciation. In Canada, economic developments have been broadly in line with the outlook in the April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Despite the second wave of the virus, first quarter GDP growth came in at a robust 5.6 per cent. While this was lower than the Bank had projected, the underlying details indicate rising confidence and resilient demand. Household spending was stronger than expected, while businesses drew down inventories and increased imports more than anticipated. Renewed lockdowns associated with the third wave are dampening economic activity in the second quarter, largely as anticipated. Recent jobs data show that workers in contact-sensitive sectors have once again been most affected. The employment rate remains well below its pre-pandemic level, with low wage workers, youth and women continuing to bear the brunt of job losses. With vaccinations proceeding at a faster pace, and provincial containment restrictions on an easing path over the summer, the Canadian economy is expected to rebound strongly, led by consumer spending. Housing market activity is expected to moderate but remain elevated. Strong growth in foreign demand and higher commodity prices should also lead to a solid recovery in exports and business investment. Despite progress on vaccinations, there continues to be uncertainty about the evolution of new COVID-19 variants. More broadly, the risks to the inflation outlook identified in the April MPR remain relevant. As expected, CPI inflation has risen to around the top of the 1-3 percent inflation-control range, due largely to base-year effects and much stronger gasoline prices. Core measures of inflation have also risen, due primarily to temporary factors and base year effects, but by much less than CPI inflation. While CPI inflation will likely remain near 3 percent through the summer, it is expected to ease later in the year, as base-year effects diminish and excess capacity continues to exert downward pressure. The Governing Council judges that there remains considerable excess capacity in the Canadian economy, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s April projection, this happens sometime in the second half of 2022. The Bank is continuing its QE program to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by Governing Council’s ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Bank of Canada maintains policy rate and forward guidance, adjusts quantitative easing program FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario July 14, 2021 The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being adjusted to a target pace of $2 billion per week. This adjustment reflects continued progress towards recovery and the Bank’s increased confidence in the strength of the Canadian economic outlook. The global economy is recovering strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with continued progress on vaccinations, particularly in advanced economies. However, the recovery is still highly uneven and remains dependent on the course of the virus. The recent spread of new COVID-19 variants is a growing concern, especially for regions where vaccination rates remain low. Global GDP growth is expected to reach 7 percent this year and then moderate to about 4 ½ percent in 2022 and just over 3 percent in 2023. This is a slightly stronger forecast than the one in the Bank’s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and primarily reflects a stronger US outlook. Global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Rising demand is supporting higher oil prices, while non-energy commodity prices remain elevated. The Canada-US exchange rate is little changed since April. In Canada, the third wave of the virus slowed growth in the second quarter. However, falling COVID-19 cases, progress on vaccinations and easing containment restrictions all point to a strong pickup in the second half of this year. The Bank now expects GDP growth of around 6 percent in 2021 – a little slower than was expected in April – but has revised up its 2022 forecast to 4 ½ percent and projects 3 ¼ percent growth in 2023. Consumption is expected to lead the recovery as households return to more normal spending patterns, while housing market activity is projected to ease back from historical highs. Stronger international demand should underpin a solid recovery in exports. As domestic and foreign demand increases and confidence improves, business investment will gain strength. Employment has once again begun to rebound, and we expect the hardest-hit segments of the labour market to post strong gains as the economy re-opens. However, the pace of the recovery will vary among industries and workers, and it could take some time to hire workers with the right skills to fill jobs. The aftermath of lockdowns and ongoing structural changes in the economy both mean that estimates of potential output and when the output gap will close are particularly uncertain. CPI inflation was 3.6 percent in May, boosted by temporary factors that include base-year effects and stronger gasoline prices, as well as pandemic-related bottlenecks as economies re-open. Core measures of inflation have also risen but by less than the CPI. In some high-contact services, demand is rebounding faster than supply, pushing up prices from low levels. Transitory supply constraints in shipping and value chain disruptions for semiconductors are also translating into higher prices for cars and some other goods. With higher gasoline prices and on-going supply bottlenecks, inflation is likely to remain above 3 percent through the second half of this year and ease back toward 2 percent in 2022, as short-run imbalances diminish and the considerable overall slack in the economy pulls inflation lower. The factors pushing up inflation are transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely. The Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens sometime in the second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.

The selection was made by the independent members of the Bank’s Board and was approved by the federal Cabinet. Ms. Rogers succeeds Carolyn A. Wilkins, who resigned from the Bank on December 9, 2020. As Senior Deputy Governor, Ms. Rogers will oversee the Bank’s strategic planning and operations, and provide leadership to the Bank’s role in promoting a stable and efficient financial system. As a member of the Bank’s Governing Council, she will share responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy. She will also be a member of the Bank’s Board of Directors. ""Carolyn Rogers’ wide-ranging experience and unique set of skills superbly complement those of Governor Tiff Macklem and rest of the Bank’s Governing Council,” said Claire Kennedy, Lead Director and Chair of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors. “Her deep knowledge of the Canadian financial system, federal and provincial financial institutions, and payments systems will be invaluable to the Bank in its financial stability responsibilities, and its continued work on payments modernization, central bank digital currency, climate risks and the digitalization of the economy and financial system.” Governor Tiff Macklem warmly welcomed Ms. Rogers to the new role: “I am delighted that Carolyn Rogers will be joining our team. Her domestic and international experience will bring a diverse perspective to the Bank. She is also a strong senior leader and strategic thinker – invaluable skills as the Bank charts an ambitious path to best serve Canadians.” A native of Winnipeg, Ms. Rogers currently serves as Secretary General of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. From 2016 to 2019, Ms. Rogers served as Assistant Superintendent, Regulation Sector at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), where she was responsible for OSFI’s policy-related functions, including capital, accounting, and legislation.

Some observers have attributed a significant part of this increase in commodity prices to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs.

A. Tinsley Under bond-rate transmission of monetary policy, the authors show that a generalized Taylor Principle applies, in which the average anticipated path of policy responses to inflation is subject to a lower bound of unity. This result helps explain how bond rates may exhibit stable responses to inflation, even in periods of passive policy.

This article defines and documents these measures, focusing on central bank asset purchases and their impact on central bank balance sheets. It then discusses the challenges of identifying the effects of these measures and explores possible exit strategies.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Sharon Kozicki appointed as Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario July 21, 2021 The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Sharon Kozicki as Deputy Governor, effective August 2, 2021. As Deputy Governor, Ms. Kozicki will join the Bank’s Governing Council, which sets the strategic direction of the Bank and is its policy-making body. This appointment brings the number of Governing Council members back up to six, its usual size. Once Carolyn Rogers, the Bank’s new Senior Deputy Governor, assumes her duties in December 2021, the Bank’s Governing Council will temporarily consist of seven people. This will allow for a broader diversity of views and analysis and will allow for smooth succession in the event of future retirements. “I am very pleased to welcome Sharon Kozicki to Governing Council. The Bank has long benefitted from Sharon’s thought leadership on monetary policy design, implementation and communication,” said Governor Tiff Macklem. “Her intellect and expertise will make an important contribution to our Governing Council deliberations and help ensure we take decisions based on diverse perspectives to fulfil the Bank’s mandate now, and in the future.” Until Ms. Rogers’ arrival at the Bank in December, Ms. Kozicki will share responsibility for overseeing the Bank’s financial system activities with Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle. Since August 2013, Ms. Kozicki has been Advisor to the Governor and Secretary to Governing Council, helping to guide the Bank’s outlook for the Canadian economy and overseeing production of the quarterly Monetary Policy Report. In 2016, she led the Bank’s work on reviewing the monetary policy framework ahead of the 2016 renewal of the inflation-targeting agreement with the Government of Canada. Her earlier roles at the Bank included Managing Director of the Bank’s Canadian Economic Analysis Department and Deputy Managing Director of the International Economic Analysis Department. Before joining the Bank in 2006, Ms. Kozicki was an economist with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, DC, and later Vice President and Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Born in Ottawa, Ms. Kozicki obtained a bachelor of science degree and a master’s degree in economics at the University of Toronto and a PhD from the University of California San Diego.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Bank of Canada maintains policy rate and forward guidance, adjusts quantitative easing program FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario July 14, 2021 The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being adjusted to a target pace of $2 billion per week. This adjustment reflects continued progress towards recovery and the Bank’s increased confidence in the strength of the Canadian economic outlook. The global economy is recovering strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with continued progress on vaccinations, particularly in advanced economies. However, the recovery is still highly uneven and remains dependent on the course of the virus. The recent spread of new COVID-19 variants is a growing concern, especially for regions where vaccination rates remain low. Global GDP growth is expected to reach 7 percent this year and then moderate to about 4 ½ percent in 2022 and just over 3 percent in 2023. This is a slightly stronger forecast than the one in the Bank’s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and primarily reflects a stronger US outlook. Global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Rising demand is supporting higher oil prices, while non-energy commodity prices remain elevated. The Canada-US exchange rate is little changed since April. In Canada, the third wave of the virus slowed growth in the second quarter. However, falling COVID-19 cases, progress on vaccinations and easing containment restrictions all point to a strong pickup in the second half of this year. The Bank now expects GDP growth of around 6 percent in 2021 – a little slower than was expected in April – but has revised up its 2022 forecast to 4 ½ percent and projects 3 ¼ percent growth in 2023. Consumption is expected to lead the recovery as households return to more normal spending patterns, while housing market activity is projected to ease back from historical highs. Stronger international demand should underpin a solid recovery in exports. As domestic and foreign demand increases and confidence improves, business investment will gain strength. Employment has once again begun to rebound, and we expect the hardest-hit segments of the labour market to post strong gains as the economy re-opens. However, the pace of the recovery will vary among industries and workers, and it could take some time to hire workers with the right skills to fill jobs. The aftermath of lockdowns and ongoing structural changes in the economy both mean that estimates of potential output and when the output gap will close are particularly uncertain. CPI inflation was 3.6 percent in May, boosted by temporary factors that include base-year effects and stronger gasoline prices, as well as pandemic-related bottlenecks as economies re-open. Core measures of inflation have also risen but by less than the CPI. In some high-contact services, demand is rebounding faster than supply, pushing up prices from low levels. Transitory supply constraints in shipping and value chain disruptions for semiconductors are also translating into higher prices for cars and some other goods. With higher gasoline prices and on-going supply bottlenecks, inflation is likely to remain above 3 percent through the second half of this year and ease back toward 2 percent in 2022, as short-run imbalances diminish and the considerable overall slack in the economy pulls inflation lower. The factors pushing up inflation are transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely. The Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens sometime in the second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 8, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on October 27, 2021.

This article defines and documents these measures, focusing on central bank asset purchases and their impact on central bank balance sheets. It then discusses the challenges of identifying the effects of these measures and explores possible exit strategies. The potential costs of these policies are also analyzed, as well as the broader implications for monetary policy frameworks.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Sharon Kozicki appointed as Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario July 21, 2021 The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Sharon Kozicki as Deputy Governor, effective August 2, 2021. As Deputy Governor, Ms. Kozicki will join the Bank’s Governing Council, which sets the strategic direction of the Bank and is its policy-making body. This appointment brings the number of Governing Council members back up to six, its usual size. Once Carolyn Rogers, the Bank’s new Senior Deputy Governor, assumes her duties in December 2021, the Bank’s Governing Council will temporarily consist of seven people. This will allow for a broader diversity of views and analysis and will allow for smooth succession in the event of future retirements. “I am very pleased to welcome Sharon Kozicki to Governing Council. The Bank has long benefitted from Sharon’s thought leadership on monetary policy design, implementation and communication,” said Governor Tiff Macklem. “Her intellect and expertise will make an important contribution to our Governing Council deliberations and help ensure we take decisions based on diverse perspectives to fulfil the Bank’s mandate now, and in the future.” Until Ms. Rogers’ arrival at the Bank in December, Ms. Kozicki will share responsibility for overseeing the Bank’s financial system activities with Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle. Since August 2013, Ms. Kozicki has been Advisor to the Governor and Secretary to Governing Council, helping to guide the Bank’s outlook for the Canadian economy and overseeing production of the quarterly Monetary Policy Report. In 2016, she led the Bank’s work on reviewing the monetary policy framework ahead of the 2016 renewal of the inflation-targeting agreement with the Government of Canada. Her earlier roles at the Bank included Managing Director of the Bank’s Canadian Economic Analysis Department and Deputy Managing Director of the International Economic Analysis Department. Before joining the Bank in 2006, Ms. Kozicki was an economist with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, DC, and later Vice President and Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Born in Ottawa, Ms. Kozicki obtained a bachelor of science degree and a master’s degree in economics at the University of Toronto and a PhD from the University of California San Diego.

Given how important Lynx is as Canada’s wholesale payment system, a disruption or failure of this system could significantly and adversely affect the financial system and economy. This designation brings Lynx under formal Bank oversight. As part of Canada’s payments modernization efforts, Lynx replaces the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS). It inherits the operational functions to: reinforce the Bank’s policy interest rate provide a means for settling obligations from other financial market infrastructures (FMIs) channel liquidity from the Bank to financial institutions in times of crisis Payment systems under Bank oversight must comply with the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures issued by the Bank for International Settlements’ Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions. The principles ensure risks in the system are adequately monitored and controlled. Designation provides legal protection regarding payment finality. It also places Lynx under the Bank’s resolution regime, ensuring continued operations in the unlikely but plausible event that the payment system becomes non-viable. Additional information Under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act, the Bank has formal responsibility for the designation and oversight of clearing and settlement systems (also known as FMIs) that could pose a systemic or payments system risk. Currently, five systemically important FMIs and two prominent payment systems, including Lynx, are subject to the Bank’s oversight. Systemically important FMIs are FMIs that have the potential to pose a risk to Canada’s financial system. If one participant is unable to meet its obligations to an FMI, that could transmit financial problems through the FMI and cause other participants to be unable to meet their obligations. Prominent payment systems have the potential to pose risks to Canadian economic activity through a disruption or failure that could affect public confidence in the overall Canadian payments system. For more information on how the Bank identifies systemically important FMIs and how designation protects them against risk, see the Guideline Related to Bank of Canada Oversight Activities Under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act.

Search the site Toggle Search Home Press Press Releases Bank of Canada maintains policy rate, continues forward guidance and current pace of quantitative easing FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Media Relations Ottawa, Ontario September 8, 2021 The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being maintained at a target pace of $2 billion per week. The global economic recovery continued through the second quarter, led by strong US growth, and had solid momentum heading into the third quarter. However, supply chain disruptions are restraining activity in some sectors and rising cases of COVID-19 in many regions pose a risk to the strength of the global recovery. Financial conditions remain highly accommodative. In Canada, GDP contracted by about 1 percent in the second quarter, weaker than anticipated in the Bank’s July Monetary Policy Report (MPR). This largely reflects a contraction in exports, due in part to supply chain disruptions, especially in the auto sector. Housing market activity pulled back from recent high levels, largely as expected. Consumption, business investment and government spending all contributed positively to growth, with domestic demand growing at more than 3 percent. Employment rebounded through June and July, with hard-to-distance sectors hiring as public health restrictions eased. This is reducing unevenness in the labour market, although considerable slack remains and some groups – particularly low-wage workers – are still disproportionately affected. The Bank continues to expect the economy to strengthen in the second half of 2021, although the fourth wave of COVID-19 infections and ongoing supply bottlenecks could weigh on the recovery. CPI inflation remains above 3 percent as expected, boosted by base-year effects, gasoline prices, and pandemic-related supply bottlenecks. These factors pushing up inflation are expected to be transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely. Wage increases have been moderate to date, and medium-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Core measures of inflation have risen, but by less than the CPI. The Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens in the second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding future adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective. Information note The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 27, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time.
