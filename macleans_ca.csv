Politics Let's reopen Ontario and Quebec. You go first. Paul Wells: The plans that premiers Legault and Ford released on Monday were road maps and not timetables—and there are good reasons why By Paul Wells April 27, 2020 Ford applauds as he hands out prepared meals to front line health care workers at Scarborough Health Network hospital in Toronto on April 24, 2020 (CP/Frank Gunn) At last the day came when the politely populist premiers of Ontario and Quebec—the provinces where four-fifths of Canada’s COVID-19 patients reside—announced their plans to roll away their stone and step into the post-pandemic light. The plans were nearly empty and the premiers looked terrified. The Ontario document, A Framework for Reopening Our Province, has timelines that mention no date after April 27, which was the day the document was released. It listed three phases: “Protect and Support,” which is what’s been happening; “Restart,” which theoretically comes next; and “Recover,” which in theory will happen someday. The “Restart” phase is described in conspicuously belts-and-suspenders terminology: a “careful, stage-by-stage approach” during which “public health and workplace safety will remain the top priority” and “public health officials will carefully monitor” whether there are new outbreaks “for two-to-four weeks.” The big question: “whether it is necessary to change course” and essentially revert to the current cave days. This next phase will kick in when cases are durably declining, hospitals can handle any influx of new cases, and public-health tracing can follow any new cases. The second of those boxes, mercifully, has probably already been ticked. The third may never be, because this is such a sneaky virus. Where is Ontario on the first? A reporter asked. Premier Doug Ford couldn’t say. Quebec, the epicenter of the Canadian outbreak, has a slightly more concrete plan about which Quebec officials seemed commensurately less confident. “If we see that the situation isn’t under control, we’ll push the timetable back,” premier François Legault said. “The watchword will be prudence.” Another watchword will also be regionalism. Montreal is in the very early stages of a decline in active caseload following what was, and in many ways remains, one of the worst outbreaks in North America. The rest of the province looks more like the rest of the country. So Legault is re-opening elementary schools and public daycares outside greater Montreal in two weeks, on May 11. In the Montreal region they’ll open a week later. High schools stay closed until September. And even that timetable exaggerates the imminence of a post-COVID social era. Schools will reopen “if and only if” the situation doesn’t deteriorate from now to May 11, Legault said. And school won’t even be mandatory: “Parents who want to keep their children at home won’t be penalized in any way.” It’s pretty easy to anticipate 72 hours of large-scale game theory beginning on May 9, as tens of thousands of parents use Facebook, Zoom and text messages to ascertain whether they’re better off sending the kids to school or keeping them home. Class sizes will, in any event, be capped at 15, essentially requiring some number of parents to keep their children out. And after that? When does your local barber shop, dry cleaner, skate sharpener or driver’s license office open? We’ll see. It’s a far cry from the easy certainty of commentators like the shock jocks on Quebec City radio and the more nuanced impatience of columnists in the Sun papers, which essentially delivered their readership whole to the Ford Conservatives. It’s an impatience all of us have heard in family conversations. It’s an impatience most of us feel. You know the songbook as well as I do: Look, this is ridiculous, nobody signed on for global economic euthanasia, nobody was told in March that we’d still be here in May and maybe July and maybe January, everybody has to die of something, suicide and obesity and delayed surgery kill people too, and we’re pushing those numbers up as we try to tamp this one down. (Suddenly everyone’s a public-health ninja who knows more about all this than Theresa Tam and Bonnie Henry.) But it’s quite another matter to be the person in charge when the rubber hits the road. People are full of bravado for society and sometimes less so for their circle. Two weeks seems a reasonably manageable timeframe for a partial resumption of what was, after all, everyone’s everyday life until mid-March. But push it forward and make it personal: How do you feel about sending your own son or daughter back to school tomorrow? Are you ready for a family dinner this weekend? Everyone’s got to die of something, so how about Uncle Ned in late May by drowning in his own pulmonary fluids? That’s a harder call. It helps explain why the plans Legault and Ford released on Monday were, in Ford’s words, road maps and not timetables. And why it left some columnists, whose responsibility extends no further than their keyboards—I know, I live there too—righteously cranky. The fact is, it’s hard to plan next steps because disaster continues despite the best efforts to contain it: 57 deaths in Ontario in one day, 84 in Quebec. Many more still to come. The closest parallel to this coronavirus in recent history was the 1918-19 flu outbreak, and that one was worse in the fall than it had been in the spring. Legault and Ford aren’t even leading the process of deciding what happens next: like good populists, they’re being led by it, and if they looked worried on Monday it’s because they’re well aware there’s a shift change underway in the reopening debate. The debate was led until now by people who gain by sounding bold. They’re finding themselves outnumbered by people with everything to lose. Suddenly waiting doesn’t sound like such a bad idea.

Health Coronavirus in Canada: These charts show how our fight to 'flatten the curve' is going The end of April brings grim statistics: Canada’s number of COVID-19 cases topped 54,000, with 3,300 deaths, but there is some good news: the national rate of new cases has slowed to three per cent, down from 17 per cent at the beginning of the month By Patricia Treble May 1, 2020 Note: Data in the charts last updated on May 4 at 9 a.m. EDT. April is “a sad season of life without growth…It has no day,” wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in This Side of Paradise. For Canada in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 30 days filled with anxiety and grief. April 1 was the day when Canada’s cumulative tally of cases topped the 10,000 mark. New cases were being announced at the rate of about 1,600 a day, giving the nation a rate of increase of around 17 per cent. Already, regional disparities were becoming apparent. As COVID-19 spread with deadly speed through the long-term care (LTC) facilities of Ontario and Quebec, those provinces were posting daily rate increases above the national rate. In contrast, British Columbia had slowed its rate of increase to less than half the national rate after bringing in reforms in the wake of its own LTC crisis. At the start of the month, Canada had performed around 250,000 tests for the virus, averaging between 10,000 and 30,000 a day. Ontario was dealing with severe testing backlogs, averaging only about 5,000 tests daily. Alberta was completing roughly the same number each day, but given its smaller population, it actually had the highest testing rate in the country. By April 30, some 54,250 people had been infected in Canada, with 3,300 dying of the virus. Of those deaths, 89 per cent were aged 70 and older, even though this group accounts for just 12 per cent of the population. That age disparity could be traced, to a great degree, to the outbreaks at LTC and other group residences. In Ontario alone, 1,000 residents of these homes died in April, according to an open-source tally by scientist Iacovos Michael. The situation in Quebec was even worse; in Montreal alone, 125 residences had outbreaks by the end of April and the conditions were so dire that the government asked the military for help. Ontario soon followed in asking for troops to work in five hard-hit facilities. (Patricia Treble and Lauren Cattermole) Yet there was some good news as temperatures rose and flowers bloomed. The number of new cases stabilized at around 1,400 to 1,600 a day, roughly the same number as at the start of the month. And by April 30, the national rate of increase had slowed to three per cent, on a seven-day rolling average, with only Alberta above that rate. Some provinces, including Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, had reduced their number of new cases to one or two every week or two. That set up May as the month of staged reopenings of provincial economies and societies. And a whole new dynamic of the COVID-19 crisis. Why use percentage charts: By looking at the percentage change in cases, it’s easier to see trends that are not apparent in raw numbers. Daily increases can fluctuate wildly—such as when Quebec combined its confirmed and probable cases into one number on March 24, which resulted in a one-day spike of nearly 800 cases. So, to help see shifts without the graphic “noise” generated by these daily fluctuations, we’ve used a method called a rolling (or moving) average, which compares percentage changes between seven-day averages, to smooth the lines for each jurisdiction and allow trends to be more readily apparent. (Patricia Treble and Lauren Cattermole) Why use logarithmic charts: COVID-19 is increasing at an exponential pace, which can overwhelm normal linear charts. In contrast, overall trends are apparent when compared using a logarithmic chart. To explain his popular COVID-19 logarithmic charts on the Financial Times website, data expert John Burn-Murdoch has this handy explanation: the space between 100 and 1,000 is the same as the space between 1,000 and 10,000, because exponential increases means it takes the same amount of time to go between those two milestones. That allows readers to easily see if jurisdictions are following the same path or doing better or worse.

Ottawa There's no putting a shine on Canada's fiscal picture Bill Morneau's 'fiscal snapshot' predicts a $343-billion deficit—nearly 16 per cent of the country's annual GDP By Nick Taylor-Vaisey July 8, 2020 Morneau takes part in a media lock-up for the federal government's economic and fiscal snapshot (Sean Kilpatrick/CP) Finance ministers usually turn federal budgets into polished exercises in public relations. They show off their plans for the future, sprinkling new spending and tax credits among all of Canada’s regions and assorted interest groups. They stuff the boring fiscal tables at the back of unwieldy books, the covers of which feature smiling faces and sunshine. Bill Morneau’s economic and fiscal snapshot—tabled in the midst of a pandemic and riddled with gloomy projections asterisked by persistent uncertainty—doesn’t pretend the good times are here to stay. These are bad times, and everyone knows it. Sure, this summer’s update makes a big deal of the billions in emergency spending that filled the bank accounts of workers without jobs and businesses with no revenue. And the fiction writers at the Department of Finance still invented characters—Nathan and Emily, parents of two young kids; Sammy, a restaurant owner; Anna, a post-secondary student—who illustrate the depth and breadth of the widespread federal economic bailout. Morneau was suitably optimistic on the floor of the House of Commons. “Canadians are resourceful. Canadians are resilient. Together, we will get through this and build a better, fairer, and stronger Canada,” he said. But the document he tabled is largely devoid of fanfare, and it’s easy to feel depressed even picking a page at random. Here’s what passes for good news. Canada doled out the most direct fiscal support of any G7 nation, and the total dollar value of the economic response—including tax deferrals and liquidity support—is also tops among that group of countries. Yet coming out of 2020, federal projections say Canada will have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio of any G7 nation. The feds also claim their response plan substantially softened the hit to GDP growth, the unemployment rate and the prospects of Canadian families: “Despite clear challenges individual households may be facing, overall Canadians’ household finances appear to be holding up well so far.” RELATED: Did Bill Morneau even sleep a wink? But those numbers won’t make many headlines. The word of the day is uncertainty, which the fiscal snapshot says is “magnified to unprecedented levels.” The finance department’s survey of private sector economists in May had “shifted dramatically” from mid-March, when the coronavirus hit Canada hard. Those early forecasts predicted flat GDP growth in 2020. May’s survey, by contrast, produced predictions, on average, of a seven per cent drop. As the government’s forecasters attempted to predict what’s next, they added their own estimates to the private sector group’s best guesses—which varied wildly for the remainder of 2020. A resurgence of the virus would, of course, “severely hamper the economic recovery.” The feds gamed out two scenarios—”uneven and gradual recovery” and “virus resurgence”—in addition to the private sector numbers. The first scenario envisioned a world in which repetitive peaks in virus transmission leave households hesitant to visit most public spaces, and force businesses to remain shuttered because they can’t afford the cost of re-opening. The knock-on effect of more persistent, and permanent job losses produces an estimated 9.6 per cent decline in real GDP growth. Finance planners also looked at a scarier future, in which uncontrolled virus transmission re-emerges later this year and coincides with the next flu season. Even with improved preventative measures and contact tracing, more prolonged shutdowns would hit Canada with a “deeper and longer-lasting negative impact.” Canada’s GDP would theoretically decline by 11.2 per cent in 2020, and GDP growth would fall “below that of even the most pessimistic private sector forecast by the end of 2021.” The big number, the kind of figure that ends up at the top of news stories, is this year’s projected deficit. The parliamentary budget officer, Yves Giroux, had pegged it only several weeks ago as higher than $250 billion. Various private-sector economists had predicted up to $300 billion in red ink. The fiscal snapshot offers an even higher number: $343.2 billion, a consequence of vast sums of spending and similarly eye-popping totals in foregone revenue. Canada’s federal debt-to-GDP ratio had hovered just above 30 per cent for the most recent Liberal term in office. That rate is expected to leap to 49.1 per cent this year, and total debt will surpass the trillion-dollar mark that will end up in bold on newspaper front pages. In 2018-19, long before the pandemic unleashed economic chaos on the global economy, Canada’s annual deficit represented 0.6 per cent of GDP. This year, that will shoot up to 15.9 per cent. RELATED: Why Canada might need a temporary COVID-19 tax and repayment fund A general rule of thumb in budget literacy is that the deeper within the document a table resides, the more revealing it is of government finances. True to form, the 121st page of the fiscal snapshot is where the devil is hiding in the details. Table A2.2 points out the $227.9 billion in emergency spending: the CERB, the federal wage subsidy and all the other money earmarked for workers and employers. But just above that line on the same table is another hit to the federal bottom line: $81.3 billion in “economic and fiscal developments” since last year’s fiscal update. Source: Department of Finance Think of that as code for the $40.8 billion in income tax revenue projected last fall that, due to “developments,” federal coffers won’t see—$30.9 billion of which is personal income tax. Excise taxes, import duties, carbon pricing, EI premiums and other revenues, including crown corporations’ net profits, are all revised downward. The government’s financial position is now in a different universe than just a few months ago. Last year, the feds collected $341 billion in revenue and racked up $375.3 billion in expenses. Those projected numbers for 2020-21 have now fallen to $268.8 billion and risen to $612.1 billion, respectively. In terms of adjectives, “unprecedented” barely covers it. But there is one more piece of good fiscal news. All that new debt is pretty cheap. Because interest rates have made borrowing historically cheap, the feds will actually pay $4.3 billion less in charges on the billions of new debt they’ve accrued than they had projected to pay on what they’d already borrowed. Just don’t expect that silver lining on Page A1 of your local daily.

Society Sticky notes of gratitude festoon a COVID-19 vaccination clinic The notes cover three-quarters of the arena glass, creating a rainbow of hope By Michelle Cyca May 14, 2021 The Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre in St. Catharines has been converted from a hockey arena to a COVID-19 vaccination clinic for Niagara area residents (Photograph by Carlos Osorio) In St. Catharines, Ont., the Seymour-Hannah Sports and Entertainment Centre has been converted to a bustling COVID-19 vaccination clinic. Clinical manager Natalie Ferrero and her team of 80—including students, paramedics and nurses who have come out of retirement—provide up to 1,500 vaccinations a day. The clinic opened Feb. 17, the same day the first sticky note was added to the wall. Now, the notes cover three-quarters of the arena glass, creating a rainbow of hope and gratitude. “That’s what has kept us going,” says Ferrero. “It was very stressful, especially at the beginning, and the staff would read the notes at the end of each day.” After thousands of vaccinations and nearly as many thankful messages, one encounter stands out for Ferrero. “A little lady in her 80s came in one day. She was a cancer survivor, but her cancer had come back and she was starting chemo again,” Ferrero says, “And she started to cry. She said, ‘I haven’t been hugged in a year. I’m doing this all alone.’ I told her, ‘I’ve been vaccinated—may I hug you?’ And I did.” Vaccinated recipients leave messages about what getting the vaccine means to them (Photograph by Carlos Osorio) FILED UNDER: Canada Coronavirus COVID-19 vaccines Editor's Picks Advertisement Advertisement 0 © Copyright 2021 St. Joseph Communications.

Ottawa 338Canada: The Conservatives surge, the Liberals slide Philippe J. Fournier: The latest 338 projection shows the Liberals falling two seats per day since the campaign began. The Conservatives are the new favourites. By Philippe J. Fournier August 29, 2021 O'Toole and his wife, Rebecca, board their campaign plane for a flight to Hamilton, Ont. on Aug. 25, 2021 in Ottawa (Ryan Remiorz/CP) It was (another) difficult week for Justin Trudeau’s Liberals in public opinion polls. The trends we observed in the first week of this short campaign continued and even intensified in the second week. With support for the Liberals in a downward spiral in key regions of Canada, several polls now show the Conservatives have taken the lead in voting intentions in the country. In the latest seat projections, Conservatives and Liberals may now stand neck-in-neck, but the all-important “momentum” of this campaign is clearly on the side of Erin O’Toole’s team. Let’s take a look back at the polls of the past week: Earlier last week, the Angus Reid Institute, Léger, Abacus Data and Ipsos all released figures indicating that the Liberals had lost ground during the first week of the campaign. With tighter voting intentions (particularly in Ontario), these internet panel polls gave the Liberals national leads between one and four points over the Conservatives. We look forward to these firms’ newest figures next week to whether the Liberal Party has slowed this trend. According to the three polling firms with daily rolling polls, namely Mainstreet Research, EKOS and Nanos Research, support for the Liberals fell significantly as the week went along while the Conservative Party (CPC) surged ahead. As of this morning, Nanos has the CPC leading by a modest 2-point margin, whereas EKOS and Mainstreet measure the CPC much further ahead, by 6 and 10 points respectively over the Liberals. All three pollsters now show a statistical tie in Ontario, and all have the CPC regaining levels of support comparable to those of 2019 in Western Canada—a region which, since the election of Erin O’Toole to the leadership of the CPC in August 2020, initially seemed lukewarm to the new Conservative leader. Support for the NDP remained generally stable during the week with national support between 19 and 22 per cent. Jagmeet Singh’s team is projected for potential gains in Ontario and appear to have boosted its support somewhat in the Prairies. In Quebec, we will have to watch whether the return of former MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau will move the needle in the province. Obviously, without local polling in the riding of Berthier-Maskinongé, it will be difficult to know whether Brosseau has a realistic chance of taking over the riding she narrowly lost to the Bloc Québécois in 2019, but her return is positive news for Singh in Quebec. For the Bloc Québécois, last week’s polls all indicate support below 30 per cent in Quebec. With figures ranging from 23 to 29 per cent in the province, the support for the Bloc appears to have declined since 2019, hence some ridings narrowly won by the BQ in 2019 could be in danger of changing colours. Moreover, with the rise in popularity of Erin O’Toole elsewhere in the country, Yves-François Blanchet will have to adjust his strategy to keep his party’s in-roads from 2019, especially in the Quebec City area and among older, traditionally more right-of-centre voters, whom the CPC is targeting. The Green Party of Canada is in serious danger of falling off the map in this election. According to current projections, Green MP Paul Manly could be in danger of losing his riding of Nanaimo-Ladysmith on Vancouver Island (currently in a three-way fight with the Conservatives and the NDP). If the trend continues, former leader Elizabeth May could, once again, find herself the only elected member of her party. Finally, polls differ somewhat as to the support for Maxime Bernier’s People Party. The Mainstreet and EKOS IVR polls have measured national support of up to 6 and 7 per cent for the PPC, but other polling firms measure the party in the 2 to 4 per cent range instead. Can Bernier get elected in his home riding of Beauce? This is difficult to assess for the moment, especially since it is in Quebec where PPC support is lowest among the traditional survey regions in Canada. Here are the 338Canada updated vote projections. We note that the Conservative Party has taken the lead for the first time since the start of the pandemic. However, the current gap between the CPC and the Liberals remains inferior to the projection’s uncertainty, therefore we must still call this a statistical tie between the two parties: Nonetheless, even though it technically is a statistical tie, one party is in decline since the writ has dropped on Aug. 15, and the other has been gaining ground since day one of the campaign. Here are the vote projections since the beginning of August. While the NDP and BQ have remained generally stable, the lines at the top are clearly moving in opposite directions: Seat-wise, the Liberals have fallen to an average of 140 seats from coast to coast, and the Conservatives have caught up to them: While the seat projections of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party overlap around the same values, it is worth noting that in my column published two weeks ago, the Liberals stood at an average of 166 seats. The Liberals have therefore fallen by an average of two seats per day since the campaign began, and we do not know yet whether that slide has stabilized. The most significant movement in vote intentions comes from Ontario. When the campaign began, the Liberals held an average lead of 10 points over the Conservatives. Both parties are now tied in the province, and the seat projections in Ontario have moved accordingly: We also should not dismiss the CPC surge in British Columbia in the past two weeks. Even though regional sample sizes in federal polls are smaller for B.C. than Ontario and Quebec (and therefore should be used with caution), we nevertheless observed significant movement in favour of the Conservatives at the expense of the Liberals in the province. Whereas the Liberal Party appeared on its way to make gains in B.C. merely two weeks ago, it now appears it will have to fight for many of the seats it won in 2019: In Quebec, we have not yet observed any notable movement in voting intentions since the campaign was launched. In fact, with the exception of the Bloc’s modest decline, voting intentions in the province remain essentially stuck to the results of the 2019 election. Nevertheless, if the Bloc does indeed stand below the 30 per cent mark, this would most likely benefit the Liberals, and could potentially translate into additional Liberal Quebec seats. The first French debate on the TVA (Québécor) network will occur this Thursday (Sept. 2), so we will watch the numbers in Quebec closely this week. Against all expectations just last month, the Conservatives should now be perceived as the favourites to win the most seats in Canada. Granted, today’s update puts the Liberals and the CPC in a statistical tie, but one party is in free fall while the other has been on the rise. The question is therefore: Will the CPC be able to maintain this momentum in public support until election day? In 2015 and 2019, Justin Trudeau had his best campaign performances as the underdog in the race. Will he manage to repeat this feat, or will the 2021 campaign become “the one campaign too many” for Trudeau? What at first appeared to be a boring federal campaign has become anything but. * * * Details of this projection are available on the 338Canada page.
