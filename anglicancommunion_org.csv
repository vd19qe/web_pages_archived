Read about what Anglicans/Episcopalians believe. Learn about their work in a wide range of ministries and activities. Christ is Risen! A service for Easter Sunday (12 April) prepared by the Anglican Communion Office Covid-19: A message from global Anglican leadership The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Chair of the Anglican Consultative Council, the Secretary General of the Anglican Communion, and the five primates elected to represent their regions on the Standing Committee of the Anglican Communion, write a joint letter to the Anglican Communion about the Covid-19 pandemic. A message to Anglicans around the world from the global leadership of the Anglican Communion As governments around the world react and respond to the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic, many people are finding themselves facing unprecedented restrictions on their day-to-day lives. Many of us will have lived with such restrictions on a temporary basis in our particular country or region over recent years in response to instability, wars, and natural disasters. But for many, such restrictions are new. In any event, the global nature of the restrictions put them on an entirely different scale not seen since the Second World War. Many provinces of the Anglican Communion have suspended public worship in response to local official advice. This, along with other restrictions people are being asked to face, may be daunting, confusing and upsetting. The first thing that we want to say is that the suspension of public corporate acts of worship does not mean that we stop worshipping God. We can worship Him and continue to pray both privately and within our families. We have a number of resources to help you pray, including the Anglican Cycle of Prayer, through which we can join together, around the world, to pray for specific dioceses and provinces of our Anglican Communion. You can find these at anglicancommunion.org/prayer. The second thing we want to say is a reminder to us all to continue to place our trust in God. In his letter to the Romans, the Apostle Paul said: “I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” And Paul, with Timothy, in their letter to the Church at Philippi, said: “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” In our prayers, in addition to praying for those who are ill, and for those who are lonely, we should pray for wisdom for those in authority and for strength to be given to medical workers. We should do more than pray. We should also act by heeding the advice of our respective national and regional authorities who are working to contain the virus; and we should care for those who are unable to care for themselves. We want you to know that we are all praying for you all at this time and we will continue to pray for the whole of God’s Church and God’s World.

A service for the 4th Sunday of Easter 2020 (3 May) by the Anglican Communion Office Covid-19: An update from the Anglican Communion Office During this time of global lockdown, the Anglican Communion Office has suspended most of its programmatic activity. International travel is effectively impossible and so the usual round of meetings cannot take place. At the same time, the attention of primates, bishops and other provincial staff are focussed on supporting their people and their churches during this unprecedented pandemic. As a result of this, some 14 Anglican Communion staff have been, or are in the process of being, furloughed, with the support of the UK government’s Covid-19 job retention scheme. These staff members are, effectively, under extended leave of absence and will return to work when the conditions are rights. The Anglican Communion Office is continuing to function, albeit at a reduced capacity and with staff working from home, in accordance with official guidance by the authorities in London and New York. The departmental Directors at the ACO are using this time to re-evaluate their activities and priorities to enable the ACO to more effectively support member churches in their response to this changed world.

A service for Pentecost Sunday and ""Thy Kingdom Come"" (31 May) Covid-19: An update from the Anglican Communion Office During this time of global lockdown, the Anglican Communion Office has suspended most of its programmatic activity. International travel is effectively impossible and so the usual round of meetings cannot take place.

These staff members are, effectively, under extended leave of absence and will return to work when the conditions are rights. The Anglican Communion Office is continuing to function, albeit at a reduced capacity and with staff working from home, in accordance with official guidance by the authorities in London and New York. The departmental Directors at the ACO are using this time to re-evaluate their activities and priorities to enable the ACO to more effectively support member churches in their response to this changed world. In March 2020, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Chair of the Anglican Consultative Council, the Secretary General of the Anglican Communion, and the five primates elected to represent their regions on the Standing Committee of the Anglican Communion, wrote a joint letter to the Anglican Communion about the Covid-19 pandemic.

International travel is effectively impossible and so the usual round of meetings cannot take place. At the same time, the attention of primates, bishops and other provincial staff are focussed on supporting their people and their churches during this unprecedented pandemic. As a result of this, some 14 Anglican Communion staff have been, or are in the process of being, furloughed, with the support of the UK government’s Covid-19 job retention scheme. These staff members are, effectively, under extended leave of absence and will return to work when the conditions are rights. The Anglican Communion Office is continuing to function, albeit at a reduced capacity and with staff working from home, in accordance with official guidance by the authorities in London and New York. The departmental Directors at the ACO are using this time to re-evaluate their activities and priorities to enable the ACO to more effectively support member churches in their response to this changed world. In March 2020, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Chair of the Anglican Consultative Council, the Secretary General of the Anglican Communion, and the five primates elected to represent their regions on the Standing Committee of the Anglican Communion, wrote a joint letter to the Anglican Communion about the Covid-19 pandemic.

NEW: Plant Anglican - the Anglican Communion Church Planting Network The Anglican Communion Church Planting Network – or Plant Anglican for short – is a global network of men and women within, or associated with the Anglican Communion, who are united in their passion to see new churches planted in every global community to reach new people with the good news of Jesus Christ. The primary aim of Plant Anglican is to be a resource that encourages fellow church planters to be as effective as possible at planting churches in their own contexts. Members of Plant Anglican share a call from God to learn from each other and inspire one another to see God’s Kingdom expand to previously unreached areas, and flourish where His Church is already at work. Click here to visit the Plant Anglican website. Covid-19: An update from the Anglican Communion Office The Anglican Communion Office (ACO) at Saint Andrew’s House in west London has been closed since March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and official UK Government regulations and guidance to curb the spread of the virus. A number of staff are on furlough – the UK government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme – and all other staff are working from their homes.

A number of staff are on furlough – the UK government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme – and all other staff are working from their homes. This has an inevitable effect on the activity and output from the office. We are continuing to serve the Anglican Communion and its four Instruments of Communion; but at a reduced capacity. We currently anticipate the ACO remaining closed until at least the Spring of 2021, but we continue to keep the situation under review, following the latest official government and scientific advice. In March 2020, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Chair of the Anglican Consultative Council, the Secretary General of the Anglican Communion, and the five primates elected to represent their regions on the Standing Committee of the Anglican Communion, wrote a joint letter to the Anglican Communion about the Covid-19 pandemic.

NEW: Renewal 2021: Standing Committee unveil new focus for the Anglican Communion Office The Anglican Communion Office is being re-structured following a review led by the Archbishop of Cape Town, the Most Revd Thabo Makgoba. The review was requested by the Anglican Communion Standing Committee last year; and the outcome was communicated to staff in January. A statutory consultation is ongoing. Visit anglicancommunion.org/renewal2021 for more details of the changes. Covid-19: An update from the Anglican Communion Office The Anglican Communion Office (ACO) at Saint Andrew’s House in west London has been closed since March 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and official UK Government regulations and guidance to curb the spread of the virus. A number of staff are on furlough – the UK government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme – and all other staff are working from their homes. This has an inevitable effect on the activity and output from the office. We are continuing to serve the Anglican Communion and its four Instruments of Communion; but at a reduced capacity. We currently anticipate the ACO remaining closed until at least the Spring of 2021, but we continue to keep the situation under review, following the latest official government and scientific advice. In March 2020, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Chair of the Anglican Consultative Council, the Secretary General of the Anglican Communion, and the five primates elected to represent their regions on the Standing Committee of the Anglican Communion, wrote a joint letter to the Anglican Communion about the Covid-19 pandemic.
