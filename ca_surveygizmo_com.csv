Skip survey header Niagara Region Public Health: COVID-19 Community Health Survey I About the survey 1. The reason for this “Niagara Region Public Health (NRPH) Community Health Survey I” is to provide a snapshot of the health and well-being of Niagara residents, approximately 8 months after COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency in Ontario (March 17, 2020). The results of this survey will inform ways to improve Niagara Region Public Health's programs and services in response to the changing needs of Niagara residents during this time. This survey is the first of two surveys (1 out of 2 surveys). Another survey will be sent in a future phase to look at changes in the health and well-being of Niagara residents. The current survey will ask questions about: ● Physical activity, eating and behaviours ● Mental health and well-being ● Community safety ● Healthcare services use ● Access to public health information Instructions This online survey takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. If you have any questions or problems completing the survey, please email the survey team and someone will respond to you. If you are a parent/guardian of children under the age of 18 years old, you will also have the choice to answer child-specific questions related to their health and your experience with child care access. This is an additional 5 minutes of your time. For future surveys and group discussions, you also have the choice to provide your e-mail address, so we may follow up with you with future phases of this work. Risk and benefits There are no foreseeable risks from participating in this survey that are greater than those encountered in daily life. However, some questions may be personal, or you may feel some discomfort answering them. You may select ""prefer not to answer"" or ""don't know"" for questions you do not wish to answer.
