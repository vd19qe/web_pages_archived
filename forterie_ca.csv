Regarding Short Term Rentals, while the Province of Ontario is under Grey Shutdown, only the following are permitted: 6. (1) Every person who provides short term rental accommodation shall ensure that any rentals are only provided to individuals who are in need of housing. To find out more, please visit: https://www.ontario.ca/page/list-essential-workplaces Short-term Rentals in Fort Erie The Fort Erie Short-term Rental program was launched in 2020 to help establish and regulate terms and conditions for short-term rental businesses operating in Fort Erie. The program was introduced by Town Council due to a growing number of concerns from fire services, bylaw enforcement and local residents. Some areas of concern included fire safety, property maintenance and a lack of local contact. Starting January 1, 2020, all Fort Erie short-term rental operators (such as Airbnbs) are required to obtain a short-term rental licence from the Town of Fort Erie. Licence application forms can be completed online. Failure to obtain the appropriate licence will result in a $600 fine, 7-day operating suspension and 10 demerit points. In addition, a list of registered short-term rental properties in Fort Erie is now available. Contacting By-law Enforcement We want everyone to enjoy being part of the Fort Erie community. If you are concerned that a short-term rental property might be violating Town bylaws (i.e., noise and nuisance, parking, property standards, fire safety or building violation), please take a minute to review our FAQs or short-term rental by-law to confirm. If confirmed, please call Municipal By-law Enforcement during hours of operation at 905-871-1600, ext. 5216.

As a result of a regulation change, licensed establishments may create a patio adjacent to their premise or increase the size of their patio once they are permitted to welcome patrons on-site. This temporary measure will allow the public to safely enjoy service that meets social distancing requirements and other public health guidelines. While the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) will not require licensees to apply or pay a fee for these temporary extensions, licensed establishments must ensure they have municipal approval and meet all other applicable requirements. To assist in responding to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Town of Fort Erie has developed a Temporary Outdoor Patio program. Applicants wishing to establish a new temporary outdoor patio or temporarily expand an existing outdoor patio must complete this application. All items must be completed and submitted prior to approval. No fees shall apply to this application.

As a result of a regulation change, licensed establishments may create a patio adjacent to their premise or increase the size of their patio once they are permitted to welcome patrons on-site. This temporary measure will allow the public to safely enjoy service that meets social distancing requirements and other public health guidelines. While the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) will not require licensees to apply or pay a fee for these temporary extensions, licensed establishments must ensure they have municipal approval and meet all other applicable requirements. To assist in responding to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Town of Fort Erie has developed a Temporary Outdoor Patio program. Applicants wishing to establish a new temporary outdoor patio or temporarily expand an existing outdoor patio must complete this application. All items must be completed and submitted prior to approval. No fees shall apply to this application.
