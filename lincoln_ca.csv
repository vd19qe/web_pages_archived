Your property tax is based on the value of your property determined by the Provincial Governmentâs Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) and the Municipal tax rate. Lincolnâs tax bill accounts for three agencies. In addition to the Town of Lincoln's portion (36%) of the tax bill, property taxes pay for the delivery of community programs and services by Niagara Region (including waste) (51%) and the school boards (13%). The impact to property taxes is a combination of these three agencies, but Lincoln only controls approximately 1/3 of your tax bill. For 2020, the overall blended rate of the three agencies is 5.3%, with Lincolnâs portion is only 2.17% on your overall tax bill. Therefore, household impact is based on all three agencies & your property assessment (overseen by MPAC). Where do tax dollars go? A portion of every tax dollar is used to provide a wide range of programs and services to ensure a high quality of life for residents. For every $1 of the Town's portion of your tax bill, you receive the following programs and services: 25 cents parks, facilities, recreation, and culture 23 cents public works, roads, & infrastructure 16 capital levy & special infrastructure levy 12 cents fire services 9 cents legislative & administration (Council, Finance, IT, CAO, Clerks, HR, Communications) 7 agency, boards, commissions (Library, BIA) 5 cents planning & municipal enforcement 3 cents economic development & tourism Reminder for 2020 payment: In response to the Coronavirus pandemic, the Town is suspending late fees & interest on property taxes, water bills and accounts receivable until June 30, 2020. Tax Bill Mailing Date Due Dates Interim First week of February February 28, 2020 and April 30, 2020 Final First week of July July 31, 2020 and Sept. 30, 2020 Tax Certificates A tax certificate is a statement of the status of taxes, which is strongly recommended when buying or selling a property, showing outstanding taxes or arrears and includes any water/wastewater charges owing. Tax certificates are $50 (including all applicable taxes) per roll number and anyone can request one. Tax verbals are not provided at any time. To obtain a tax certificate, please complete the Property Information Request Form (Tax Certificate Requests) and forward it to the Town of Lincoln Municipal Offices with the required fee. Duplicate Tax Receipts/Statement of Account A fee of $9 will be charged for a duplicate receipt or statement of account. Change of Mailing Address If the property has changed ownership, send the tax bill to the new owner or return it to the Tax Department, indicating to whom the transfer of title has been made. To prevent misdirected tax bills, please advise the Tax Department in writing of any mailing address changes. Failure to receive a tax bill does not excuse payment of taxes and could result in penalty and interest charges of 1.25% per month applied to unpaid accounts. Please complete the Change of Mailing Address Form and forward it to the Town of Lincoln to the attention of the Tax Clerk.

2018 Guiding Transformational Change in Lincoln Future Focus Since the beginning of this term of Council, Council and staff have been focusing on a number of key priorities. Future Focus is Councilâs strategic plan that outlines these high priority items. It also highlights more than 100 other actions and initiatives contained in the strategic plan. The thrust of Future Focus is about transformational change; the kind of change that is helping us move closer to the Townâs vision of a community that offers citizens A Place to Grow. A Place to Prosper. A Place to Belong. Council developed this vision in consultation with citizens across Lincoln who shared their ideas about an ideal community and about their hopes and dreams for our community. Our vision guides Council and staff each day as we make decisions, deliver services and plan for the future. How are we changing? By doing business differently By making strategic investments to preserve, enhance or acquire new community assets, and; By pursuing and creating opportunities to bring people together â opportunities that enhance both their ability and their desire to participate in the life of the community. Doing Business Differently Changing the way we do business has involved modernizing our systems and processes to improve customer service. We have begun to transition to making more tasks available online to make things easier for the resident. This includes registering for various summer and recreational programs, applying for permits, and making complaints or suggestions. We have also updated our accounting systems, moving many of our services to optional online processing. This includes paying for parking tickets, fire inspections, and burning permits. We recognize the need for convenience in this increasingly digital world. We are happy to give residents the ability to complete tasks outside of normal business hours. In short, we are embracing technology to provide better customer service and become a more efficient and effective organization. Public Engagement When it comes to public consultation, we are going the extra mile to seek input from the public on issues and projects. Your Council cares what people think and believes it is important to provide opportunities for residents to share their thoughts, ideas and views. The public consultation process for the Prudhommeâs project â one of the most exciting developments in the townâs history â took place over two years because it is vital we get projects like this right. Communications We are working hard to do a better job of communicating with residents, because they have a right to know what is happening in their community and how they can get involved. We have invested in communications, hiring in-house expertise to help us create opportunities for meaningful, two-way communication with residents. To help achieve this we developed and launched a robust website and are proactively using social media to talk with residents. By-law Enforcement A real practical example of how we are doing business differently is the improvement we have made to our ability to respond to complaints about by-law infractions. We have brought the enforcement function in-house, meaning we now have Town staff dedicated to responding to complaints and to enforcing Town by-laws. Economic Development Office We have secured hands-on expertise to help us with our economic development activities. This vital role ensures that resources are available to help support local employers, which create the vast majority of new jobs in any community. We are now better able to help business people and other investors navigate government so they can establish faster and more smoothly. The Townâs economic development officer is also helping us strengthen relationships with our regional, provincial and federal partners. Partnering with other Levels of Government Over the past four years, the Town has received nearly $10 million from other levels of government. These funds have helped us complete and enhance projects that positively benefit our community. A great example is the Konkle Creek Naturalization Project. With over $600,000 funded by the Provinceâs Clean Water Wastewater Fund, the project will begin this year providing stormwater and erosion issues, along with enhancing our active transportation network with trails. Infrastructure The second way we are making transformational change in Lincoln is through strategic investments in infrastructure and other community assets across the Town. Jordan Village In Jordan, we are investing $6 million in a much-needed plan to realign the intersection at 19th and King St. With the help and input of local residents and business owners, we created a comprehensive plan. The plan is about: Creating new, attractive space for people to gather and support new commerce planned for the area. Accommodating special events and activities, such as a farmersâ market to draw residents and visitors. Increasing traffic and pedestrian safety, which has long been a concern, by turning a confusing 5-way intersection into a 4-way and installing a traffic light. And; Enhancing an historic village and neighbourhood, and creating a better place for residents, businesses and visitors. Transportation and Roads Since 2014, we have invested $11 million to maintain, upgrade or reconstruct roads. By investing a little to keep good roads in good condition, we avoided nearly $10 million worth of major repair or reconstruction work We are addressing road safety through various efforts â our speed reduction program using digital signs to determine roads where reducing speed is key, using traffic calming strategies like speed humps, increasing enforcement with support from NRPS. Prokich Park The Prokich family generously donated a portion of the park land to the Town, in honour of Angelina Prokich, and in turn, the Town is investing $1 million in the park to make it a great place for leisure and recreation for people of all ages. Community Connectedness We are working on projects and initiatives that enable people to come together â to play, to learn, to celebrate our history, to explore arts and culture, or just to gather and socialize. Places that bring people together are among our most precious assets because they foster and support a sense of community. Vibrant, healthy and prosperous communities create opportunities for people to connect with each other and with places. Prudhommes Prudommes is a great example of what planners call a âcomplete community,â which offers a mix of residential options, commercial facilities, amenities, and recreational space. This site has a long history as a place for business, for people to gather and to enjoy access to the waterfront. Museum and Cultural Centre The proposed new Lincoln Museum and Cultural Centre (the Jordan Historical Museum of the Twenty) will be another jewel in Lincolnâs crown. The museum will not only provide a home for its extensive collection of historical artifacts, but will also provide multi-purpose space for cultural exhibitions and a wide variety of public events and activities. Parks, Recreation and Culture Master Plan The Town has begun working on a Parks, Recreation and Culture Master Plan that will outline how we want to continue developing our sports, recreation, parks and cultural programs and facilities. It starts with gathering information from residents to understand what families and individuals want, what the gaps are, and how best to address them. uLinc We introduced the uLinc transit pilot in the fall of 2017. It is a free bus service that links Beamsville, Vineland and Jordan and will help us determine if there is enough need and desire for a permanent service. Transit service is a key element of complete communities as it provides access to reliable, affordable transportation to those who prefer this mode of transportation or have no alternative means of getting around.

Town of Lincoln rebate program will assist with rodent removal from residential properties Media Release - Town of Lincoln rebate program will assist with rodent removal from residential properties Town of Lincoln rebate program will assist with rodent removal from residential properties (Lincoln, ON - Sept. 29, 2020) - A new pilot rebate program will help Town of Lincoln residents cover the cost of removing rodents from outside their homes in urban areas. The Residential Rodent Control Rebate Program will give residents 50 per cent (to a maximum of $200) toward the cost of a licensed Ontario exterminator to assist with the removal of rodents from the exterior of their residential property. âAs the Town has a large agricultural component, with many food and water sources, rodents are attracted to this area. The Town has been receiving increased complaints from residents regarding the sighting of rodents in urban areas. This rebate will help address residentsâ concerns and mitigate the costs of removal, as well as provide enforcement staff with additional tools to seek compliance,â says Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. To be eligible for a rebate, residents must submit a form to the Town and have the exterior of their property inspected by a Town by-law enforcement officer to determine if there are conditions that may cause rodents to nest, feed, drink or breed on the property. Should the officer discover any issues, the property owner must correct them prior to applying for the rodent rebate program. Once the property conforms to the prescribed standards, a resident may hire an exterminator. The one-year pilot Residential Rodent Control Rebate Program is only available to residents living in the urban boundary, not businesses, for one-time participation annually. The program only includes exterior services. âTown of Lincoln staff recognize the impact rodents can have on a property and identify that this is an area of concern. The rebate program will assist residents in lessening the impact of rodents on their property,â says Town of Lincoln Councillor Adam Russell. âStaff will continue to work with residents and other agencies to monitor and follow up on concerns. We can expect to see improvements through a combination of by-law enforcement, property owner lot maintenance and community cooperation.â -30- For more information, please contact: Matt Bruder Associate Director of Planning & Development Town of Lincoln Direct: 905-563-2799 ext. 231 Tel: 905-563-8205 MBruder@lincoln.ca Date modified: 2020-09-29 About Lincoln Lincoln is located in the heart of Niagara region, with one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.

Town of Lincoln rebate program will assist with rodent removal from residential properties Media Release - Town of Lincoln rebate program will assist with rodent removal from residential properties Town of Lincoln rebate program will assist with rodent removal from residential properties (Lincoln, ON - Sept. 29, 2020) - A new pilot rebate program will help Town of Lincoln residents cover the cost of removing rodents from outside their homes in urban areas. The Residential Rodent Control Rebate Program will give residents 50 per cent (to a maximum of $200) toward the cost of a licensed Ontario exterminator to assist with the removal of rodents from the exterior of their residential property. âAs the Town has a large agricultural component, with many food and water sources, rodents are attracted to this area. The Town has been receiving increased complaints from residents regarding the sighting of rodents in urban areas. This rebate will help address residentsâ concerns and mitigate the costs of removal, as well as provide enforcement staff with additional tools to seek compliance,â says Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. To be eligible for a rebate, residents must submit a form to the Town and have the exterior of their property inspected by a Town by-law enforcement officer to determine if there are conditions that may cause rodents to nest, feed, drink or breed on the property. Should the officer discover any issues, the property owner must correct them prior to applying for the rodent rebate program. Once the property conforms to the prescribed standards, a resident may hire an exterminator. The one-year pilot Residential Rodent Control Rebate Program is only available to residents living in the urban boundary, not businesses, for one-time participation annually. The program only includes exterior services. âTown of Lincoln staff recognize the impact rodents can have on a property and identify that this is an area of concern. The rebate program will assist residents in lessening the impact of rodents on their property,â says Town of Lincoln Councillor Adam Russell. âStaff will continue to work with residents and other agencies to monitor and follow up on concerns. We can expect to see improvements through a combination of by-law enforcement, property owner lot maintenance and community cooperation.â -30- For more information, please contact: Matt Bruder Associate Director of Planning & Development Town of Lincoln Direct: 905-563-2799 ext. 231 Tel: 905-563-8205 MBruder@lincoln.ca Date modified: 2020-09-29 About Lincoln Lincoln is located in the heart of Niagara region, with one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.

The Zoning By-law is the Townâs primary tool to regulate the use of all land in the Town, it divides land into various zone categories (i.e., residential, commercial, employment), and establishes what uses are permitted and where buildings can be located on a property. In February 2019, WSP Canada Group Limited was retained by the Town to undertake the Comprehensive Zoning By-law Review. The new Comprehensive Zoning By-law will implement the policies of the Townâs new Official Plan and provide updated zoning and development standards that reflect new policy and regulatory initiatives at the provincial and Town level. Background & current Zoning By-law No. 93-14-Z1 Zoning By-law Review Discussion Paper Zoning By-law Review Draft Summary Report Public Information Centre #2 Members of the public are invited to provide comment on the draft summary report & discussion paper developed over the past eight months from stakeholder & community consultation.

(Jan. 13, 2020) â The provincial government has declared a state of emergency until at least Thursday, February 11, 2021 which include enhanced public health and workplace safety measures in effect for all of Ontario. The Province also issued a stay-at-home order that takes effect 12:01 a.m. Thursday, January 14; people should only leave home for groceries, medical appointments, exercise or essential work, and all businesses must ensure that any employee who can work from home, does work from home. âLincoln residents have been patient and most people are following the guidelines â thank you for everything youâre doing to keep our community safe. But as positive cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations increase significantly, this is not a situation we can take lightly so it will be crucial to stay the course and follow these new guidelines,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âWe have another stretch to get through and we will pull through by looking out for each other. We need to take this seriously."" âWith these latest restrictions from the Province, Lincoln residents need to do as much as they can from their homes â including doing business with the Town through our online and phone services, accessing curbside pickup for library and online shopping where possible,â said Michael Kirkopoulos, CAO of the Town of Lincoln. âPlease be careful, stay safe and if you can, support our local businesses who continue to adapt and are doing their best to stay afloat.â Impacts to Town of Lincoln facilities and services in response to the state of emergency are as follows: Town Hall is now open by appointment only. Visitors are asked to contact the Town ahead of time to make an appointment for essential services. Please call 905-563-8205 or e-mail info@lincoln.ca to book appointments.

Help prevent the spread of COVID-19 The best way to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 is to: Practice physical distancing by avoiding close interaction with others (stay 2 metres apart). Wash your hands often with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Wear a face covering in public (indoors and outdoors) in accordance with Niagaraâs Face Covering By-law, following the provincial order. Limit trips into the community to specific purposes that are important to you (e.g. shopping, dining, particular recreational activities), since extra time outside of the home adds to crowds and makes it more difficult for others to physically distance. Stay home if you are sick. Although COVID-19 is often very mild, minor symptoms should not be ignored. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve. Report a COVID-19 concern To report a concern about gatherings or business not following COVID-19 guidelines, contact Municipal Law Enforcement: MLE@lincoln.ca 905-563-2799 ext. 289 For By-law enforcement after hours (after 4:30 p.m. and weekends), please call Niagara Region dispatch line at 905-984-3690 or 1-877-552-5579.

(Jan. 13, 2020) â The provincial government has declared a state of emergency until at least Thursday, February 11, 2021 which include enhanced public health and workplace safety measures in effect for all of Ontario. The Province also issued a stay-at-home order that takes effect 12:01 a.m. Thursday, January 14; people should only leave home for groceries, medical appointments, exercise or essential work, and all businesses must ensure that any employee who can work from home, does work from home. âLincoln residents have been patient and most people are following the guidelines â thank you for everything youâre doing to keep our community safe. But as positive cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations increase significantly, this is not a situation we can take lightly so it will be crucial to stay the course and follow these new guidelines,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âWe have another stretch to get through and we will pull through by looking out for each other. We need to take this seriously."" âWith these latest restrictions from the Province, Lincoln residents need to do as much as they can from their homes â including doing business with the Town through our online and phone services, accessing curbside pickup for library and online shopping where possible,â said Michael Kirkopoulos, CAO of the Town of Lincoln. âPlease be careful, stay safe and if you can, support our local businesses who continue to adapt and are doing their best to stay afloat.â Impacts to Town of Lincoln facilities and services in response to the state of emergency are as follows: Town Hall is now open by appointment only. Visitors are asked to contact the Town ahead of time to make an appointment for essential services. Please call 905-563-8205 or e-mail info@lincoln.ca to book appointments. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 5 people (previously 10). Hilary Bald outdoor rink will remain open, with a capacity limit of 5 on the rink at a time. Please continue to practice physical distancing. The rink will now close at 8 p.m. Hear & Now Mental Health Walk-in Clinic is now available online and by phone appointment only. This service provides free one-on-one mental health counselling for children and youth up to age 18 in Lincoln. Call 1-800-263-4944 to book a counselling session. For more information on facility and service impacts and to see whatâs open and whatâs closed in Lincoln since the provincial shutdown starting December 26, visit https://lincoln.ca/coronavirus-pandemic/facility-service-impacts. Help prevent the spread of COVID-19 The best way to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 is to: Practice physical distancing by avoiding close interaction with others (stay 2 metres apart). Wash your hands often with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Wear a face covering in public (indoors and outdoors) in accordance with Niagaraâs Face Covering By-law, following the provincial order. Limit trips into the community to specific purposes that are important to you (e.g. shopping, dining, particular recreational activities), since extra time outside of the home adds to crowds and makes it more difficult for others to physically distance. Stay home if you are sick. Although COVID-19 is often very mild, minor symptoms should not be ignored. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve. Report a COVID-19 concern To report a concern about gatherings or business not following COVID-19 guidelines, contact Municipal Law Enforcement: MLE@lincoln.ca 905-563-2799 ext. 289 For By-law enforcement after hours (after 4:30 p.m. and weekends), please call Niagara Region dispatch line at 905-984-3690 or 1-877-552-5579.

The operating budget of $23.6 million covers the daily costs of running Town services. Council has approved overall increase of 1.9% on the Townâs portion of the tax rate: 0% capital, 0.9% operating & 1% money in the bank, at a blended rate of 1.75% How the Budget Works Each year, Town staff put forward a preliminary budget. Mayor and Councilâwith input from residents and businessesâapprove a final budget that addresses council priorities, operations, services, infrastructure and asset management. It includes the Operating Budget and Capital Budget. Operating Budget: The operating budget covers day-to-day spending on services such as salaries, grass cutting, recreation programs and fire services. Property taxes cover a large portion of the operating budget, while the rest is funded through provincial grants and subsidies, as well as user fees. Capital Budget: The capital budget funds construction and repair of the Townâs infrastructure. A portion of the capital budget is funded from property taxes, while the rest is funded from reserves, development charges and other levels of government. Water and Wastewater Rates: This budget is allocated to pay for the provision of: Clean drinking water Wastewater collection and removal The infrastructure and maintenance of the Townâs water and wastewater systems On average, 50% of each utility bill paid to the Town of Lincoln also covers Niagara Regionâs water and wastewater costs. The Town acts as a retailer in the distribution of water to the resident, while the Region acts as a wholesaler to the municipality. These programs are funded through user fees. The revenue collected from these fees pays for the services and the infrastructure to deliver them. Balancing the Budget Provincial law requires the Town to balance its budget each year, which means the money coming in equals the money going out. To balance the budget, the Town can increase its revenues through property taxes or user fees, or through changing or reducing the cost of services. Municipalities also have the opportunity to borrow money at competitive rates.

Town of Lincoln launches online engagement site, Speak Up Lincoln Media Release - Town of Lincoln launches online engagement site, Speak Up Lincoln Lincoln, ON - (Feb. 25, 2021) â As part of its effort to increase the level of communications and engagement with Lincoln residents and businesses, the Town has developed a new digital communication and engagement platform called Speak Up Lincoln. Speak Up Lincoln will enhance existing engagement opportunities and provide a place where community members can get updates and provide input on important Town of Lincoln projects and initiatives, at a time and place that is convenient for them. âWe are excited to launch this new platform and offer community members an opportunity to share their feedback on timely initiatives and let us know what matters most to them,â said Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âThis is just one of the ways we are supporting Council's priority of being a Vibrant Community by enhancing citizen engagement and participation, and identifying opportunities for greater transparency, accountability and inclusion.â This online engagement hub provides a centralized location for information and opportunities to share feedback. Here, community members can learn about, track, and review Town projects and issues that are important to them. Complementing the Town's offline participation opportunities, Speak Up Lincoln brings the conversations together in one central place. Through this online engagement tool, the Town is expanding the horizons on how the community and Town staff talk and share ideas about projects and concepts. The Town is launching the site at a time when in-person engagement has not been possible due to pandemic restrictions and the need to prevent community spread of COVID-19. âProviding an online space for public engagement is especially important as the pandemic continues and we are unable to hold in-person meetings for the foreseeable future,â added Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. Community members are invited to share comments on specific projects and identify which areas or topics they would like to learn more about and provide feedback on. More projects will be added to the site in line with corporate and Council priorities, annual budgets and the need for public feedback.

Town of Lincoln launches online engagement site, Speak Up Lincoln Media Release - Town of Lincoln launches online engagement site, Speak Up Lincoln Lincoln, ON - (Feb. 25, 2021) â As part of its effort to increase the level of communications and engagement with Lincoln residents and businesses, the Town has developed a new digital communication and engagement platform called Speak Up Lincoln. Speak Up Lincoln will enhance existing engagement opportunities and provide a place where community members can get updates and provide input on important Town of Lincoln projects and initiatives, at a time and place that is convenient for them. âWe are excited to launch this new platform and offer community members an opportunity to share their feedback on timely initiatives and let us know what matters most to them,â said Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âThis is just one of the ways we are supporting Council's priority of being a Vibrant Community by enhancing citizen engagement and participation, and identifying opportunities for greater transparency, accountability and inclusion.â This online engagement hub provides a centralized location for information and opportunities to share feedback. Here, community members can learn about, track, and review Town projects and issues that are important to them. Complementing the Town's offline participation opportunities, Speak Up Lincoln brings the conversations together in one central place. Through this online engagement tool, the Town is expanding the horizons on how the community and Town staff talk and share ideas about projects and concepts. The Town is launching the site at a time when in-person engagement has not been possible due to pandemic restrictions and the need to prevent community spread of COVID-19. âProviding an online space for public engagement is especially important as the pandemic continues and we are unable to hold in-person meetings for the foreseeable future,â added Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. Community members are invited to share comments on specific projects and identify which areas or topics they would like to learn more about and provide feedback on. More projects will be added to the site in line with corporate and Council priorities, annual budgets and the need for public feedback.

Town of Lincoln fast tracking approvals for tent permits and temporary patio expansions Town of Lincoln fast tracking approvals for tent permits and temporary patio expansions to support local tourism and hospitality sectors Lincoln, ON - (March 12, 2021) â The Town of Lincoln is expediting seasonal tent requests and temporary approvals for restaurants, bars, and wineries to help boost business as they reopen. As of Monday, March 1, 2021 Niagara Region entered the Red/Control Tier under the Provinceâs COVID-19 Response Framework, which allows indoor dining and outdoor dining in areas such as patios. A maximum of 10 patrons can be seated indoors and outdoor dining capacity is limited by the ability to keep patrons two metres apart. This is great news for our local businesses, as indoor dining and outdoor patios have been closed since the province-wide shut down on Dec. 26, 2020. In response, Town of Lincoln Council directed staff to come up with methods to support our tourism and hospitality industry. Approvals for tent permits and temporary patio extensions will come quickly, with an average turnaround time of 48-72 hours. Application fees for the 2021 temporary patio program are also being waived. The move aims to help businesses adapt to COVID-19 public health measures, support economic activity and give residents and tourists an opportunity to enjoy Lincolnâs superb offerings in a safe manner. âWe are making it easier for our bars, restaurants and wineries to extend their outdoor dining season and allow for increased seating capacity while following all public health guidelines,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âWe understand the toll the pandemic has taken on the local tourism and hospitality sector and we want to do everything we can to help businesses recover and prosper as the warm weather months approach.â âWe want to help businesses be able to welcome back more customers while adapting to COVID-19 public health restrictions,â said Mike Mikolic, Chair, Planning and Economic Development Committee. âWe are also happy to provide more opportunities for residents and visitors to get out and enjoy a meal at their favourite place.â Tourism and hospitality operators looking to expand or create temporary patios can contact Matt Bruder, Director, Planning and Development, at MBruder@lincoln.ca. Town staff will work with applicants to help them understand how they can safely operate an outdoor patio during the 2021 patio season. Town residents and visitors are encouraged to support our local restaurants, bars, and wineries by continuing to order curbside pickup at applicable locations. Visit ShopLincoln.ca to find out which services and dining options are currently available across our tourism and hospitality sectors.

We are pleased to announce that the Town of Lincoln will receive funding through the Province of Ontarioâs Inclusive Community Grant Program. The funding totalling $60,000 was the maximum amount a municipality was able to apply for. âThis is welcome news for Lincoln, and we look forward to making adjustments to our community facilities that will improve accessibility for our residents,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âOn behalf of Lincoln Council, I would like the thank the Minister of Seniors and Accessibility and the Provincial government for recognizing the growing need in our community to create more spaces that are inclusive and accessible for everyone.â âThank you to Councilâs continued support of this important work,â said Charlotte Sheridan, Chair of the Townâs Age-Friendly Advisory Committee. âThese upgrades will contribute to the committeeâs goal of creating a vibrant, healthy and diverse community where quality of life, inclusivity and living well are supported through all stages of life.â âThrough this funding, we can respond to the emerging needs of older adults and persons with disabilities in our community, in an environment that is rapidly changing,â added the Townâs Chief Administrative Officer Michael Kirkopoulos. âLincoln is committed to creating more accessible environments for people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds which supports our Communityâs Vision Statement â A Place to Grow, A Place to Prosper, A Place to Belong.â The Provinceâs Inclusive Community Grant Program funds projects in small urban or rural communities (with a population of less than 30,000) that will make moderate changes to the built environment and public spaces, so that they can become more inclusive and supportive of older adults and people with disabilities. The Inclusive Community grant is in addition to the $200,000 approved in the 2021 Capital Budget process. The Town has identified 44 accessibility upgrades across 10 municipal facilities that will better enhance use for residents of varying abilities. These include the following visual, audible and physical accessibility enhancements: Visual strobe fire alarm systems at 6 Town facilities Automatic door systems â 8 facilities Accessible parking â lot line painting at 10 Town facilities Barrier-free parking signage at 10 Town facilities Wall-mounted fixtures at 6 Town facilities Service counter upgrades at 2 facilities Ramps and curbs â 1 facility Washroom call station â 1 facility With the news that the funding has been allocated to the Town of Lincoln, staff are currently developing a plan to incorporate these changes by March 2022. - 30 - For media inquiries, please contact: Liliana Busnello Manager of Corporate Communications Town of Lincoln Direct: 905-563-2799 ext. 230 Tel: 905-563-8205 Date modified: 2021-04-12 About Lincoln Lincoln is located in the heart of Niagara region, with one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.

With the Provinceâs extended Stay at Home Order coming into effect in April, the Town delayed the launch of WanderLost and focused on activating online tactics such as Motherâs Day and Fatherâs Day gifting to keep the destination top of mind. With the Province safely moving into Phase One of its Reopening Framework, the Town of Lincoln can now fully activate this program and begin to realize the programâs potential to create a greater awareness of Lincoln as a tourism destination in its own right, as well as create qualified, revenue generation opportunities for local tourism business partners. WanderLost Lincoln will help visitors navigate the ever-changing limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic, plan their visit, as well as uncover the stories, promotions and events associated with Lincolnâs tourism sector. Local businesses will be able to share in important two-way conversations with their visitors, as well as learn more about their visitorsâ preferences and behaviours when visiting Lincoln. âWe are delighted to be able to finally move forward with this exciting program and put to use the much appreciated funding from our partners at the Province,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âWith summer just around the corner, our new WanderLost marketing campaign will help showcase to prospective visitors the caliber of Lincolnâs world-class craft beverage and culinary industry, its stunning natural beauty and deeply rooted cultural history.â âTourism is a key contributor to our economy, not only on a national level but also right here in Lincoln,â said Paul Di Ianni, the Townâs Director of Economic Development and Communications. âTourism also means business in Niagara, since close to 40,000 jobs and upwards of 2,800 businesses in our region are directly supported by the tourism industry.â About WanderLost The Town of Lincolnâs all-new WanderLost scavenger hunt offers a fun and free new way to explore the picture-perfect pocket of Niagara tucked between the Escarpment and Lake Ontario. With WanderLost as your guide, youâll discover our benchland businesses, heritage sites, and natural attractions that set this scenic section of Niagara in a leisurely league of its own. Great food and drink, picture-perfect panoramas, friendly faces, and feel-good vibes of supporting local businesses arenât your only rewards for exploring Lincoln! You can also earn points towards fun prizes and promotions on your travels from participating WanderLost app partners.

The Bicycle Friendly Community Award Program is an initiative of the Share the Road Cycling Coalition to help communities evaluate how bicycle friendly their community is, celebrate progress, and work toward achieving higher-level awards over time. âOn behalf of Lincoln Council and the Lincoln community, I am honoured to receive this recognition and I am certain that we will wear this designation with great pride,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âThis is truly a testament to the recent investments made by Council to ensure Lincoln is a well-connected and accessible community.â âThis is an outstanding achievement for the Lincoln community,â Carol Phillips, Chair of the Townâs Active Transportation (AT) Citizen Advisory Committee. âThe Committee members are focused on working with staff to promote active transportation and create even more opportunities for our residents and visitors alike to stay active through our AT network.â The Townâs Chief Administrative Officer Michael Kirkopoulos noted that in 2017, Lincoln received an honourable mention, however did not receive a designation. âItâs great to see that the Townâs efforts towards improving active transportation in the last few years have not gone unnoticed. Lincoln residents now have more options for cycling in town than they ever have.â To achieve this designation, the Town of Lincoln needed to demonstrate considerable achievements in the areas of Engineering, Education, Encouragement, and Evaluation & Planning. Lincolnâs designation was supported by such community strengths as: A picturesque landscape with natural features to augment the cycling experience and promote cycle tourism (e.g., vineyards, farms, orchards, creeks); A large number of cycle routes on main and side roads as well as Multi-Use Trails, loops, and provincial trails; Partnerships between Town Departments, Active Transportation Citizen Advisory Committee and Council; and A new Pumptrack at Rotary Park installed in October 2020, providing more options for recreational cycling. The judging panel and local reviewers also noted Lincolnâs efforts to improve bicycle friendliness including a Transportation Master Plan and Active Transportation Strategy adopted by Council with a designated annual budget; recent pandemic-related commitment for winter maintenance of Multi-Use Trails; and increased connectivity that includes plans for an integrated mobility and active transportation network. Moving forward, the Town will continue to work closely with the Active Transportation Citizen Advisory Committee to provide ongoing support and improvement to the Active Transportation Network. The Committee is currently working with Town staff to launch an Active Transportation Network page on the Townâs public engagement site, SpeakUpLincoln.ca, to share valuable knowledge and information to both locals and visitors to the area. Look for more details coming soon. Additionally, the Committee is working with Town staff to provide information and guidance on the creation of a new Active Transportation Network map.

The Bicycle Friendly Community Award Program is an initiative of the Share the Road Cycling Coalition to help communities evaluate how bicycle friendly their community is, celebrate progress, and work toward achieving higher-level awards over time. âOn behalf of Lincoln Council and the Lincoln community, I am honoured to receive this recognition and I am certain that we will wear this designation with great pride,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âThis is truly a testament to the recent investments made by Council to ensure Lincoln is a well-connected and accessible community.â âThis is an outstanding achievement for the Lincoln community,â Carol Phillips, Chair of the Townâs Active Transportation (AT) Citizen Advisory Committee. âThe Committee members are focused on working with staff to promote active transportation and create even more opportunities for our residents and visitors alike to stay active through our AT network.â The Townâs Chief Administrative Officer Michael Kirkopoulos noted that in 2017, Lincoln received an honourable mention, however did not receive a designation. âItâs great to see that the Townâs efforts towards improving active transportation in the last few years have not gone unnoticed. Lincoln residents now have more options for cycling in town than they ever have.â To achieve this designation, the Town of Lincoln needed to demonstrate considerable achievements in the areas of Engineering, Education, Encouragement, and Evaluation & Planning. Lincolnâs designation was supported by such community strengths as: A picturesque landscape with natural features to augment the cycling experience and promote cycle tourism (e.g., vineyards, farms, orchards, creeks); A large number of cycle routes on main and side roads as well as Multi-Use Trails, loops, and provincial trails; Partnerships between Town Departments, Active Transportation Citizen Advisory Committee and Council; and A new Pumptrack at Rotary Park installed in October 2020, providing more options for recreational cycling. The judging panel and local reviewers also noted Lincolnâs efforts to improve bicycle friendliness including a Transportation Master Plan and Active Transportation Strategy adopted by Council with a designated annual budget; recent pandemic-related commitment for winter maintenance of Multi-Use Trails; and increased connectivity that includes plans for an integrated mobility and active transportation network. Moving forward, the Town will continue to work closely with the Active Transportation Citizen Advisory Committee to provide ongoing support and improvement to the Active Transportation Network. The Committee is currently working with Town staff to launch an Active Transportation Network page on the Townâs public engagement site, SpeakUpLincoln.ca, to share valuable knowledge and information to both locals and visitors to the area. Look for more details coming soon. Additionally, the Committee is working with Town staff to provide information and guidance on the creation of a new Active Transportation Network map.

We are pleased to announce that the Town of Lincoln will receive funding through the Province of Ontarioâs Inclusive Community Grant Program. The funding totalling $60,000 was the maximum amount a municipality was able to apply for. âThis is welcome news for Lincoln, and we look forward to making adjustments to our community facilities that will improve accessibility for our residents,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âOn behalf of Lincoln Council, I would like the thank the Minister of Seniors and Accessibility and the Provincial government for recognizing the growing need in our community to create more spaces that are inclusive and accessible for everyone.â âThank you to Councilâs continued support of this important work,â said Charlotte Sheridan, Chair of the Townâs Age-Friendly Advisory Committee. âThese upgrades will contribute to the committeeâs goal of creating a vibrant, healthy and diverse community where quality of life, inclusivity and living well are supported through all stages of life.â âThrough this funding, we can respond to the emerging needs of older adults and persons with disabilities in our community, in an environment that is rapidly changing,â added the Townâs Chief Administrative Officer Michael Kirkopoulos. âLincoln is committed to creating more accessible environments for people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds which supports our Communityâs Vision Statement â A Place to Grow, A Place to Prosper, A Place to Belong.â The Provinceâs Inclusive Community Grant Program funds projects in small urban or rural communities (with a population of less than 30,000) that will make moderate changes to the built environment and public spaces, so that they can become more inclusive and supportive of older adults and people with disabilities.

The Pelham and Lincoln Public Library Boards are pleased to receive funding through the Municipal Modernization Program to facilitate a review of their potential merger, which was announced earlier this year. The potential merger of the Lincoln and Pelham Public Library Boards is poised to streamline administrative functions and expenditures in order to provide enhanced delivery of library services for our two communities and dedicate more resources directly to programs and materials. The municipalities will receive $60,000 in funding through the Municipal Modernization Program. This grant will be applied to the cost of an independent third-party reviewer who will deliver a final report with specific and actionable recommendations for cost-savings and efficiencies by both municipalities by November 30, 2021. âWe are very thankful to be awarded this funding from the Province. It will go a long way towards determining how we can meet our mutual goals of providing enhanced benefits, and more efficient and effective services to both of our communities,â said Donna Burton, Chair of the Lincoln Public Library Board. âImproving service delivery for Library users has been an ongoing priority for both of our Library Boards, and with this funding we can continue to work towards those goals,â said Nicole Nolan, Pelham Public Library Board Chair. âWe look forward to leveraging the ongoing partnership between our neighbouring municipalities in this endeavour.â The Lincoln and Pelham public libraries are a natural fit for sharing services, as the two are original members of the Libraries in Niagara Cooperative (LiNC). With a long history of partnership and working together for the betterment of the Lincoln and Pelham communities, the two Library Boards serve communities that are similar, and staff have comparable work cultures with a focus on excellent customer service. The Municipal Modernization Program was launched in 2019 to help small and rural municipalities modernize service delivery and identify new ways to be more efficient and effective. The projects selected for funding are those that support municipalitiesâ efforts to implement efficiencies, with a focus on digital modernization, service integration, streamlining development approvals and alternative service delivery. - 30 - For more information, please contact: Julie Andrews Chief Executive Officer Lincoln Public Library 905-563-7014 andrews@lincoln.library.on.ca Amy Guilmette Acting Chief Executive Officer Pelham Public Library 905-892-6443 | aguilmette@pelhamlibrary.on.ca Date modified: 2021-07-14 About Lincoln Lincoln is located in the heart of Niagara region, with one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.

The Pelham and Lincoln Public Library Boards are pleased to receive funding through the Municipal Modernization Program to facilitate a review of their potential merger, which was announced earlier this year. The potential merger of the Lincoln and Pelham Public Library Boards is poised to streamline administrative functions and expenditures in order to provide enhanced delivery of library services for our two communities and dedicate more resources directly to programs and materials. The municipalities will receive $60,000 in funding through the Municipal Modernization Program. This grant will be applied to the cost of an independent third-party reviewer who will deliver a final report with specific and actionable recommendations for cost-savings and efficiencies by both municipalities by November 30, 2021. âWe are very thankful to be awarded this funding from the Province. It will go a long way towards determining how we can meet our mutual goals of providing enhanced benefits, and more efficient and effective services to both of our communities,â said Donna Burton, Chair of the Lincoln Public Library Board. âImproving service delivery for Library users has been an ongoing priority for both of our Library Boards, and with this funding we can continue to work towards those goals,â said Nicole Nolan, Pelham Public Library Board Chair. âWe look forward to leveraging the ongoing partnership between our neighbouring municipalities in this endeavour.â The Lincoln and Pelham public libraries are a natural fit for sharing services, as the two are original members of the Libraries in Niagara Cooperative (LiNC). With a long history of partnership and working together for the betterment of the Lincoln and Pelham communities, the two Library Boards serve communities that are similar, and staff have comparable work cultures with a focus on excellent customer service. The Municipal Modernization Program was launched in 2019 to help small and rural municipalities modernize service delivery and identify new ways to be more efficient and effective. The projects selected for funding are those that support municipalitiesâ efforts to implement efficiencies, with a focus on digital modernization, service integration, streamlining development approvals and alternative service delivery. - 30 - For more information, please contact: Julie Andrews Chief Executive Officer Lincoln Public Library 905-563-7014 andrews@lincoln.library.on.ca Amy Guilmette Acting Chief Executive Officer Pelham Public Library 905-892-6443 | aguilmette@pelhamlibrary.on.ca Date modified: 2021-07-14 About Lincoln Lincoln is located in the heart of Niagara region, with one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.

Designed to address the challenges brought on by COVID-19, the $115-million Skills Development Fund aims to provide opportunities for workers and apprentices and help businesses access the qualified workers they need to recover from the pandemic. The Townâs Economic Development Department will be using the provincial funding to develop a Youth Skills Studio in partnership with Civiconnect, a non-profit organization that connects youth and the private sector to their communities to maximize their social impact through technology, innovation, and strategy. The Youth Skills Studio will provide 60,000 hours of work-integrated learning to 90 youth aged 15-29 working on 75 initiatives for local businesses. These work-integrated learning projects will enable local businesses to connect with youth who will provide digital services for their businesses, including: Digital systems administration Digital marketing Web development âConnecting young people with opportunities in technology is vital to kickstarting their careers while helping small business owners deal with the impacts of COVID-19,â said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. âThis training program is a win-win for young workers and local businesses looking for help expanding online. This investment meets the challenges of today while training our young workers in the technology of tomorrow.â âThe pandemic has shown us that businesses are in need of digital innovation and education to ensure their survival and growth in 2021 and beyond,â says Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âThis initiative will allow us to support our local businesses in facing this changing COVID-19 landscape, prepare youth for job opportunities and build upon Lincolnâs vision to be a place to grow, prosper and belong.â Town of Lincoln CAO Mike Kirkopoulos says that even before COVID-19, Town Council and staff knew that youth employment was a key element to economic growth and success. âThe pandemic has further compounded youth unemployment and underemployment, and we look forward to tackling this issue with the Youth Skills Studio here in Lincoln,â he says. Kailene Jackson, Co-Founder and Director of Programming at Civiconnect, says she is thrilled about the launch of the Youth Skills Studio. âWe will be able to mitigate some of the challenges posed by COVID-19, while contributing to long-term economic development and youth retention in the Town,â she says. âBridging the gap between youth and the business community is key to creating the prosperous and inclusive communities of tomorrow.â Paul Di Ianni, Director of Economic Development and Communications for the Town of Lincoln, recognized the importance of this financial contribution. âThis is the largest non-infrastructure-related investment the Town of Lincoln has ever seen,â he says. âThis investment will go a long way towards supporting the Townâs Economic Development Strategy, which identified youth employment and retention as a major component to supporting Lincolnâs economy.â In addition to retaining young talent in Lincoln, the Youth Skills Studio supports other priorities of Lincolnâs Economic Development Strategy by promoting business retention and expansion and innovation and leadership. It will also provide the foundation for an arts and tech hub in Lincoln. -30- For media inquiries on the Youth Skills Studio, please contact: Liliana Busnello Manager of Corporate Communications Town of Lincoln Direct: 905-563-2799 ext. 230 Tel: 905-563-8205 Date modified: 2021-08-05 About Lincoln Lincoln is located in the heart of Niagara region, with one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.

(Aug. 26, 2021) â The Town of Lincoln, supported by the Downtown Bench Beamsville BIA, has announced that it has received a $23,000 grant from Digital Main Streetâs Ontario Grants Program for a Digital Service Squad (DSS), which will provide trained digital specialists to work with local small businesses to help them adopt online technologies and digitally transform their sales, marketing, and back-office operations. The squad will begin visiting businesses in Lincoln on Monday, August 30, 2021. âWe are excited to once again have a Digital Service Squad return to Lincoln for a third year in support of our local businesses, especially as many of them are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âThe $2,500 Digital Transformation Grant can make a significant impact to small businesses, and I strongly encourage all eligible Lincoln businesses to apply and take advantage of the programming offered through Digital Main Street.â Paul Di Ianni, Director of Economic Development and Communications added that the program is an exceptional opportunity that supports our commitment to business retention and expansion, the attraction of new investment, marketing, and talent and workforce development. In addition to main street businesses, the Digital Service Squad will also target Lincolnâs tourism-based businesses that do not fall within the designated main street areas. âCOVID-19 has hit our business community hard,â said Di Ianni, âand many of these businesses need the support to enhance their digital presence.â Renewed funding of $12.37 million for the Digital Main Streetâs Ontario Grants Program (OGP) from Ontarioâs Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade (MEDJCT) and the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev) includes $3 million for the Digital Service Squad program and $7.5 million to provide 3,000 Digital Transformation Grants to qualified brick-and-mortar small businesses. The OGP is administrated by the Ontario BIA Association, in partnership with the Toronto Association of BIAs (TABIA). âOntario small businesses are the heart of our neighbourhoods and the economic foundation of our communities,â said Nina Tangri, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. âOur government is committed to being there for them as they reopen. This additional support will give these businesses the digital boost they need to raise their profile and rebuild better than ever.â The DSS will meet with brick-and-mortar small businesses at no cost to help them complete an online assessment and introduce them to online training modules to build their knowledge and skills. The DSS can also assist businesses with developing their Digital Transformation Plan (DTP) and applying for a one-time $2,500 grant to implement it. This one-on-one DSS assistance also includes support for basic website set-up, Google My Business profiles, 360-degree photos, social media presence, and much more. The DSS can also provide information on the ShopHERE program, if applicable, to assist with digital storefront set-up and e-commerce. âIn the past 17 months, as small businesses across the province fought to stay open and keep customers engaged online, Digital Service Squads were there to help,â said Kay Matthews, Executive Director of OBIAA. ""Squads jumped online themselves during lockdowns to help virtually, and businesses have consistently told us how important the DSS was to their success through the pandemic. We are thrilled to support Lincolnâs DSS and help them assist more small businesses than ever.â LEARN MORE The Town of Lincoln The Town of Lincoln, located in the heart of the Niagara Region, has one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.

Funding to be used to support four social infrastructure projects Lincoln ON â (August 23, 2021) - The Town of Lincoln is pleased to receive Provincial and Federal funding through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, which will allow four social infrastructure projects valued at $1.35 million to be completed over the next two years. The Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP) is a $30-billion infrastructure program cost-shared between federal, provincial, and municipal governments. Designed to create long-term economic growth, build inclusive, sustainable, and resilient communities, and support a low-carbon economy, the ICIP program assists communities in delivering vital services that foster greater social inclusion, improve the quality of life for residents and reflect local community needs. The Town is receiving $860,000 through the Community, Culture, and Recreation stream of the ICIP program to improve access and the quality of priority community infrastructure projects. Additionally, $173,000 has been provided through the COVID-19 Resilience stream of the ICIP program to support quick-start, short-term projects that respond to the impacts of the pandemic. In total, the Town will receive $1.03 million in funding through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program. âInvestment in social infrastructure builds strong and dynamic communities, supports economic growth, celebrates diversity, and promotes community health and wellbeing,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âWe are grateful to both the Government of Ontario and Government of Canada for continuing to invest in Lincoln and ensuring our residents have access to modern and accessible public amenities in their community. Projects that will receive support through the ICIP programs include: Installation of inclusive playground equipment at Rotary Park (Beamsville) Addition of a drive-thru service window at the Lincoln Public Library (Beamsville) Installation of rubberized surfacing at playgrounds to increase accessibility (Community-wide) Addition of a childrenâs educational space at the Lincoln Museum and Cultural Centre (Jordan) Chief Administrative Officer Michael Kirkopoulos added that Town staff continues to identify, investigate and invest the necessary time and effort to apply for all funding programs that potentially offset municipal project costs and lead to direct and measurable community benefit. âAs we have seen throughout the pandemic, culture and recreation facilities and assets are community imperatives that bring people together and help them to thrive and grow.â In 2020, Town Council approved the necessary capital contributions required to support the playground resurfacing project. In addition to the upper-level government funding, the Town acknowledges the contributions of the Rotary Club of Lincoln (Rotary Park playground) as well as Wise Guys Charity Fund (childrenâs education space) for their commitment to the noted projects.

(Aug. 26, 2021) â The Town of Lincoln, supported by the Downtown Bench Beamsville BIA, has announced that it has received a $23,000 grant from Digital Main Streetâs Ontario Grants Program for a Digital Service Squad (DSS), which will provide trained digital specialists to work with local small businesses to help them adopt online technologies and digitally transform their sales, marketing, and back-office operations. The squad will begin visiting businesses in Lincoln on Monday, August 30, 2021. âWe are excited to once again have a Digital Service Squad return to Lincoln for a third year in support of our local businesses, especially as many of them are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic,â said Town of Lincoln Mayor Sandra Easton. âThe $2,500 Digital Transformation Grant can make a significant impact to small businesses, and I strongly encourage all eligible Lincoln businesses to apply and take advantage of the programming offered through Digital Main Street.â Paul Di Ianni, Director of Economic Development and Communications added that the program is an exceptional opportunity that supports our commitment to business retention and expansion, the attraction of new investment, marketing, and talent and workforce development. In addition to main street businesses, the Digital Service Squad will also target Lincolnâs tourism-based businesses that do not fall within the designated main street areas. âCOVID-19 has hit our business community hard,â said Di Ianni, âand many of these businesses need the support to enhance their digital presence.â Renewed funding of $12.37 million for the Digital Main Streetâs Ontario Grants Program (OGP) from Ontarioâs Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade (MEDJCT) and the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev) includes $3 million for the Digital Service Squad program and $7.5 million to provide 3,000 Digital Transformation Grants to qualified brick-and-mortar small businesses. The OGP is administrated by the Ontario BIA Association, in partnership with the Toronto Association of BIAs (TABIA). âOntario small businesses are the heart of our neighbourhoods and the economic foundation of our communities,â said Nina Tangri, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. âOur government is committed to being there for them as they reopen. This additional support will give these businesses the digital boost they need to raise their profile and rebuild better than ever.â The DSS will meet with brick-and-mortar small businesses at no cost to help them complete an online assessment and introduce them to online training modules to build their knowledge and skills. The DSS can also assist businesses with developing their Digital Transformation Plan (DTP) and applying for a one-time $2,500 grant to implement it. This one-on-one DSS assistance also includes support for basic website set-up, Google My Business profiles, 360-degree photos, social media presence, and much more. The DSS can also provide information on the ShopHERE program, if applicable, to assist with digital storefront set-up and e-commerce. âIn the past 17 months, as small businesses across the province fought to stay open and keep customers engaged online, Digital Service Squads were there to help,â said Kay Matthews, Executive Director of OBIAA. ""Squads jumped online themselves during lockdowns to help virtually, and businesses have consistently told us how important the DSS was to their success through the pandemic. We are thrilled to support Lincolnâs DSS and help them assist more small businesses than ever.â LEARN MORE The Town of Lincoln The Town of Lincoln, located in the heart of the Niagara Region, has one of the most diverse economies in Niagara.
