""There's a panic mode going on right now,"" said pharmacist Larry Boggio, who owns several south Niagara pharmacy locations. Niagara-on-the-Lake pharmacist Sean Simpson called it a ""trying week"" for staff at his Simpson's Pharmasave store. ""I don't know that it will be the worst we will experience, but it's been the most amount of dramatic change in a short period of time,"" added Simpson, an Ontario Pharmacists Association board member. Despite a statement Wednesday from pharmaceutical industry advocacy organization Innovative Medicines Canada, saying ""there are no COVID-19 related shortages being reported, or current constraints on their ability to supply medicines to Canadians,"" the pharmacists say some drug distribution companies have begun rationing drug orders — limiting the amount of medications they provide to prevent stockpiling. ""The only measure they (distributors) can take is to limit supply to each pharmacy, which then creates potential shortages for those facilities that need it more in the short-term,"" Simpson said. ""I think there has been a fair bit of supply chain disruption at this time and I'm hoping that will settle."" McKesson Canada spokesperson Andrew Forgione said the distribution company has taken ""proactive steps to support responsible ordering, including temporarily adjusting daily customer ordering for some medications and certain daily essentials."" ""It is unnecessary for Canadian consumers or retailers to mass order products,"" Forgione said in an email. ""We encourage patients and customers to refill maintenance medications and seek health-care essentials in a responsible manner to avoid unnecessary strain on the system."" He said McKesson — the largest pharmaceutical distribution company in the country — is continuing to work with suppliers to meet increased demand for products being sought in relation to COVID-19. ""This demand may cause temporary variability for certain products at some store locations,"" he said. ""We are re-supplying customers as quickly as possible."" Pharmacists, however, say the rationing of prescription medicines has severely reduced the supply of drugs they receive, regardless of the size of the orders they place. Boggio said Ventolin inhalers are one product that has been in short supply, although they are vital to patients with ailments like asthma. ""We go through tons of them,"" he said. ""We order like 25, and they send us six. What good is that going to do?"" He said pharmacy staff are then forced to ration those few inhalers among patients. ""Especially at this time, these are the very vulnerable patients,"" Boggio said. ""It's not like toilet paper. If you run out of toilet paper, you can still survive. But when you run out of drugs, things happen."" Simpson said his pharmacy has faced difficulty getting an adequate supply of several medications. ""We need 12 of one item to fill the orders that we've already taken, and we're only getting three per day,"" he said. ""We're having to ask our patients to be more patient,"" he said. ""We want to make sure we have a supply for patients who need their meds."" Boggio said the vast majority of his patients understand the limitations. ""In times like this everyone needs to work together so everyone can get through this,"" he said. Forgione said McKesson is also working with the more than 1,350 hospitals and 7,100 pharmacies it serves to ensure they have appropriate access to health-care essentials while working to safeguard the pharmaceutical supply chain. ""We believe we have a responsibility to do our part to ensure continuity of care in the days and weeks ahead. We're working with pharmacies, hospitals and manufacturing partners to promote responsible ordering and distribution of daily health-care products,"" he said. ""Our role as one of Canada's key health-care distributors is one we take seriously. We will continue to do all we can to ensure products, as much as possible, are moving to customers."" Pharmacies are also stepping up protocols to ensure the safety of their staff and customers, while continuing to encourage patients to use delivery services. Simpson's pharmacy earlier this week asked its older customers to visit the store before 11 a.m., and all other customers to visit the business during the remainder of the day. But as a result of staff concerns about the number of customers who continued to visit the pharmacy, he said the pharmacy has now closed its doors to customers while setting up a makeshift drive-through in the parking lot to fill their orders while they wait in their vehicles. Boggio said staff at his pharmacies are also trying to protect customers, screening them at the door when possible. If a customer has COVID-19 symptoms or has been out of the country, he said staff fill their prescriptions as the customer waits outside — reducing their interaction with others within the business.

Although Nick Hominuk's sign, written on a large sheet of paper and posted from his hospital room, was meant for his daughter, it also brightened the hearts of people throughout the community. Andrea said she has been visiting her father almost every day since Feb. 20, after he was hospitalized as a result of complications following a knee replacement surgery. Nick, who celebrated his 79th birthday on March 1, has since been transferred to Port Colborne hospital, where he's recovering while undergoing physiotherapy. After concerns about the spread of COVID-19 meant the hospital could no longer allow visitors, Andrea said she never stopped her daily visits. Although she could no longer be at her father's side Andrea continued to visit Port Colborne hospital at least once a day, standing below his window while speaking to him on her cellphone. In doing so, she said she often attracts the attention of patients in neighbouring rooms and greets them with a wave, too. But a surprise was awaiting her when, she arrived at the hospital on Saturday. ""When I pulled up at lunchtime ... that sign was in the window. I just said, 'Oh my God!'"" the Welland resident said, laughing. She said hospital staff know she visits every day to see her father, and helped him create the sign. But seeing it in the window also reassured Andrea that her father was getting better, and his sense of humour was returning, too. Niagara Health president Lynn Guerriero called the efforts of staff at the hospital site a ""beautiful act of kindness"" and ""an example of what compassionate care looks like."" ""Our staff and physicians across Niagara are going above and beyond each day to ensure our patients are receiving high-quality care,"" Guerriero said. ""We know it's not easy for our patients and families to be apart, and we are happy that this sign created by our team brightened the spirits of this family."" Considering the anxiety in the community, Andrea said she shared a picture of the sign with friends and family as well, posting it on social media websites. She said she was overwhelmed by the response. Hundreds of people shared the image and commented on it, calling it ""incredibly sweet,"" and saying it brought tears to their eyes. ""It just blew my mind,"" Andrea said. The picture, she said, seemed to resonate with people in the community, at a time when they could use some cheering up. Andrea said her father misses his visitors, but he's aware of the reasons for the isolation. Nick has a television in his room, often tuned into news networks. ""He gets it,"" Andrea said. ""He understands what's going on and how serious it is."" She's asked him if he understands why people can't visit. ""He says it's better to be safe than sorry.""
