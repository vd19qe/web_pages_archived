FILE PHOTO: Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti stands next to demonstrators during a protest against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 2, 2020. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson The concept envisions mass production and distribution of low-cost, do-it-yourself diagnostic kits based on paper-strip designs that can be used frequently and produce results in minutes, similar to home pregnancy tests. No lab equipment or special instruments would be required. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said this week he has convened a team of public health experts, bioscience executives, government leaders and philanthropists to push for accelerated research, development and production of such tests. Proponents say that rapid, at-home COVID-19 testing would allow for real-time detection of new clusters of cases, including asymptomatic individuals - before they can spread. Such a feat has proven unattainable within the existing testing framework, which relies on laboratories to process samples and typically takes days or weeks to return results. “If we get this right, we could be doing as many as a million tests a week using paper strip testing just here in Los Angeles,” Garcetti said on Wednesday, as the city appeared to be on the verge of tamping down its latest surge of infections. When paired with expanded contact-tracing to locate and quarantine other exposed individuals, rapid in-home test kits could be as effective as a vaccine in breaking the COVID-19 transmission cycle, according to advocates led by Harvard University epidemiologist Michael Mina. ‘AT WARP SPEED’ “They can effectively be akin to a vaccine that was introduced tomorrow,” Mina told a recent conference call with reporters, as quoted by the Harvard Gazette. The tests could be produced for as little as $1 a piece, he said. “This is something we can actually do at warp speed.” Mina, Garcetti and other proponents have said such a breakthrough is critical as state and local leaders struggle to find ways to reopen schools, universities and workplaces safely. To date the respiratory virus has claimed some 5,200 lives in Los Angeles County, one of the nation’s COVID-19 hotspots, accounting for nearly half of California’s deaths from the pandemic. Mina said he envisions making home diagnostic kits so widely available Americans could test themselves daily, or every other day, as a matter of routine. The new test kits would be based on antigen detection technology that scans saliva or nasal mucous for the presence of viral proteins. This method, while quick and simple, is generally far less sensitive - with more frequent false-negative results - than the current gold standard of COVID-19 screening, called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests, which look for traces of viral genetic material. QUICK OR PRECISE That difference, according to Mina, has led to one of the chief roadblocks to biotech companies developing at-home antigen tests - reluctance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which recommends over-the-counter, non-lab tests perform at a minimum of 90% sensitivity. FDA recommends at least an 80% rate for prescription at-home tests to be used under a doctor’s supervision. “Until the regulatory landscape changes, those companies have no reason to bring a product to market,” Mina said. Mina and others, including Dr. Ashish K. Jha, a Harvard professor of medicine, insist that from a public health perspective the accuracy of home antigen tests are sufficient. Related Coverage Factbox: Latest on worldwide coronavirus spread In a commentary published by Time magazine, Jha cited government data suggesting that the current testing regime is only detecting one in 10 Americans who are infected. Responding to a Reuters query, the FDA said in a statement that it would consider alternatives, including a “strategy that involves serial testing using less sensitive tests to achieve performance.” But FDA support for such a strategy would hinge on available information showing that benefits outweigh risks and addressing “the capacity to manufacture a sufficient supply of tests with which to conduct multiple tests per person,” the agency said.

FILE PHOTO: A vial of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is seen ahead of being administered at the Royal Victoria Hospital, on the first day of the largest immunization program in the British history, in Belfast, Northern Ireland December 8, 2020. Liam McBurney/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Canada is the third country after Britain and Bahrain to give the green light to Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, developed with Germany’s BioNTech SE. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in parliament it was “a good day for Canadians”. “We will see 30,000 vaccines begin to arrive next week with many more on the horizon, but ... we’ve got a tough winter to get through,” Trudeau said. Canada is in the midst of a virulent second wave of the pandemic, with several areas of the country imposing new health restrictions, weighing down what had been a clear rebound after the first wave. General inoculations for all Canadians will begin in April after priority populations are taken care of, the government said in a vaccination plan also released on Wednesday. The nation is now “well-positioned to immunize 100% of the population in 2021,” the plan said, while a separate table distributed by the Health Ministry said immunization could be completed by the end of September. “It is going to be good for Canada and the world economy once the vaccinations start rolling out in a meaningful fashion,” said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corp in Toronto. Toronto’s stock market has rallied about 12% since the end of October and the commodity-linked Canadian dollar has climbed to a 2-1/2-year high against its U.S. counterpart as investors bet that the rollout of vaccines would boost the global economy next year. The vaccine, which the regulator said was “safe, effective and of good quality,” was approved under an interim, accelerated drug review system very similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorizations. It comes a day before a panel of advisers to the FDA is set to review and recommend whether the U.S. agency should authorize use of the Pfizer vaccine. Related Coverage Health Canada's statement approving Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 'Light at the end of the tunnel,' as Canada approves COVID-19 vaccine On Tuesday, British citizens became the first in the world to get the shots outside of clinical trials following last week’s UK approval. In a large, late-stage trial, the vaccine was shown to be 95% effective at preventing illness, far better than originally anticipated. However, on Wednesday Britain’s medicine regulator advised that people with a history of significant allergies not get Pfizer’s vaccine after two people reported adverse reactions on the first day of its rollout. Responding to questions on the allergic reactions, Health Canada officials said that is always a risk with vaccines and that they will monitor developments. They only are recommending that people who have previously had adverse reactions to any of the vaccine’s ingredients not take it for now. ‘HISTORIC MOMENT’ The province of Saskatchewan said on Wednesday it expected to receive enough doses for 1,950 people by Tuesday, intended first for healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Quebec expects to have received 55,000 doses of the vaccine by Jan. 4, the premier of the predominantly French-speaking province, Francois Legault, said. Legault also said he is weighing new restrictions and stepping up enforcement of current ones. Alberta will begin vaccinations on Wednesday, with health care workers getting the first 3,900 doses, Health Minister Tyler Shandro said. British Columbia will also have about the same number of doses as Alberta next week, but did not specify when it would begin vaccinating people. The province said it expects to vaccinate 400,000 people by the end of March. As of Tuesday, Canada had reported 429,035 total cases, an increase of 5,981 on the day before, and 12,867 deaths. “Today’s decision from Health Canada is a historic moment in our collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and is a major step towards returning to normalcy in Canada,” Cole Pinnow, president of Pfizer Canada, said in a statement. Canada has a firm order for 20 million doses of the vaccine, enough to inoculate 10 million people, with options to buy up to 56 million more. Pfizer will ship its vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage, to warehouses across Canada. For the most part, provincial and territorial health systems will administer the shots, for free. They will have final say over how to use scarce early supplies in their jurisdictions. Priority groups who will get vaccinated first include some healthcare workers, long-term care residents and employees, the elderly and Indigenous populations, according to federal guidelines. Regulators have received rolling applications for three other experimental vaccines, from Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson. The Moderna vaccine is farthest along, having completed pivotal trials showing it to be 94.1% effective at preventing illness and 100% at preventing severe COVID-19. Officials have said they expect to receive 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March. Each vaccine requires two doses given about three weeks apart. FedEx Corp and Innomar Strategies, a Canada-based unit of U.S. drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp, have been hired to provide logistical support on vaccine delivery.

The iPhone maker’s automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch. At one point, Apple drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals. Doug Field, an Apple veteran who had worked at Tesla Inc, returned to oversee the project in 2018 and laid off 190 people from the team in 2019. Since then, Apple has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers, two people familiar with the effort said, asking not to be named because Apple’s plans are not public. Apple’s goal of building a personal vehicle for the mass market contrasts with rivals such as Alphabet Inc’s Waymo, which has built robo-taxis to carry passengers for a driverless ride-hailing service. Central to Apple’s strategy is a new battery design that could “radically” reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle’s range, according to a third person who has seen Apple’s battery design. Apple declined to comment on its plans or future products. Making a vehicle represents a supply chain challenge even for Apple, a company with deep pockets that makes hundreds of millions of electronics products each year with parts from around the world, but has never made a car. It took Elon Musk’s Tesla 17 years before it finally turned a sustained profit making cars. “If there is one company on the planet that has the resources to do that, it’s probably Apple. But at the same time, it’s not a cellphone,” said a person who worked on Project Titan. It remains unclear who would assemble an Apple-branded car, but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles. And there is still a chance Apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker, rather than the iPhone maker selling an Apple-branded car, one of the people added. Two people with knowledge of Apple’s plans warned pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo/File Photo Shares of Tesla ended 6.5% lower on Monday after their debut in the S&P 500 on Monday. Apple shares ended 1.24% higher after the news. Apple has decided to tap outside partners for elements of the system, including lidar sensors, which help self-driving cars get a three-dimensional view of the road, two people familiar with the company’s plans said. Apple’s car might feature multiple lidar sensors for scanning different distances, another person said. Some sensors could be derived from Apple’s internally developed lidar units, that person said. Apple’s iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro models released this year both feature lidar sensors. Reuters had previously reported that Apple had held talks with potential lidar suppliers, but it was also examining building its own sensor. As for the car’s battery, Apple plans to use a unique “monocell” design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials, one of the people said. Apple’s design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, the person said, which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries. ”It’s next level,” the person said of Apple’s battery technology. “Like the first time you saw the iPhone.” Apple had previously engaged Magna International Inc in talks about manufacturing a car, but the talks petered out as Apple’s plans became unclear, a person familiar with those previous efforts said. Magna did not immediately respond to a request for comment. To turn a profit, automotive contract manufacturers often ask for volumes that could pose a challenge even to Apple, which would be a newcomer to the automotive market. “In order to have a viable assembly plant, you need 100,000 vehicles annually, with more volume to come,” the person said. Some Apple investors reacted to the Reuters report on the company’s plans with caution. Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple investor Gullane Capital Partners, said it could be tough for Apple to produce large volumes of cars out of the gate. “It would seem to me that if Apple develops some advanced operating system or battery technology, it would be best utilized in a partnership with an existing manufacturer under license,” Miller said. “As we see with Tesla and the legacy auto companies, having a very complex manufacturing network around the globe doesn’t happen overnight.” Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple has a history of higher margins than most automakers. “My initial reaction as a shareholder is, huh?” Eddins said. “Still don’t really see the appeal of the car business, but Apple may be eyeing another angle than what I’m seeing.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing; and Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman in Detroit; editing by Jonathan Weber, Edward Tobin and Sonya Hepinstall Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple investor Gullane Capital Partners, said it could be tough for Apple to produce large volumes of cars out of the gate. “It would seem to me that if Apple develops some advanced operating system or battery technology, it would be best utilized in a partnership with an existing manufacturer under license,” Miller said. “As we see with Tesla and the legacy auto companies, having a very complex manufacturing network around the globe doesn’t happen overnight.” Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple has a history of higher margins than most automakers. “My initial reaction as a shareholder is, huh?” Eddins said. “Still don’t really see the appeal of the car business, but Apple may be eyeing another angle than what I’m seeing.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing; and Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman in Detroit; editing by Jonathan Weber, Edward Tobin and Sonya Hepinstall Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The iPhone maker’s automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch. At one point, Apple drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals. Doug Field, an Apple veteran who had worked at Tesla Inc, returned to oversee the project in 2018 and laid off 190 people from the team in 2019. Since then, Apple has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers, two people familiar with the effort said, asking not to be named because Apple’s plans are not public. Apple’s goal of building a personal vehicle for the mass market contrasts with rivals such as Alphabet Inc’s Waymo, which has built robo-taxis to carry passengers for a driverless ride-hailing service. Central to Apple’s strategy is a new battery design that could “radically” reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle’s range, according to a third person who has seen Apple’s battery design. Apple declined to comment on its plans or future products. Making a vehicle represents a supply chain challenge even for Apple, a company with deep pockets that makes hundreds of millions of electronics products each year with parts from around the world, but has never made a car. It took Elon Musk’s Tesla 17 years before it finally turned a sustained profit making cars. “If there is one company on the planet that has the resources to do that, it’s probably Apple. But at the same time, it’s not a cellphone,” said a person who worked on Project Titan. It remains unclear who would assemble an Apple-branded car, but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles. And there is still a chance Apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker, rather than the iPhone maker selling an Apple-branded car, one of the people added. Two people with knowledge of Apple’s plans warned pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo/File Photo Shares of Tesla ended 6.5% lower on Monday after their debut in the S&P 500 on Monday. Apple shares ended 1.24% higher after the news. Apple has decided to tap outside partners for elements of the system, including lidar sensors, which help self-driving cars get a three-dimensional view of the road, two people familiar with the company’s plans said. Apple’s car might feature multiple lidar sensors for scanning different distances, another person said. Some sensors could be derived from Apple’s internally developed lidar units, that person said. Apple’s iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro models released this year both feature lidar sensors. Reuters had previously reported that Apple had held talks with potential lidar suppliers, but it was also examining building its own sensor. As for the car’s battery, Apple plans to use a unique “monocell” design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials, one of the people said. Apple’s design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery, giving the car a potentially longer range. Apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, the person said, which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium-ion batteries. ”It’s next level,” the person said of Apple’s battery technology. “Like the first time you saw the iPhone.” Apple had previously engaged Magna International Inc in talks about manufacturing a car, but the talks petered out as Apple’s plans became unclear, a person familiar with those previous efforts said. Magna did not immediately respond to a request for comment. To turn a profit, automotive contract manufacturers often ask for volumes that could pose a challenge even to Apple, which would be a newcomer to the automotive market. “In order to have a viable assembly plant, you need 100,000 vehicles annually, with more volume to come,” the person said.

REUTERS/Christinne Muschi Canada has deals with Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, but both companies ran into production problems last month and reduced shipments. The country trails many other nations in the total number of inoculations and critics accuse Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government of bungling the rollout. Ottawa buys the vaccines, while the 10 provinces and three northern territories administer them. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, said more than 240,000 doses were injected last week, the most in more than a month. “We are seeing positive signs that the rollout is ramping up. ... This is a reflection of greater supply,” he told a briefing, saying about 2.9% of Canadians had received at least one dose. “We expect this percentage to significantly increase throughout March,” he added. Canada has so far recorded a total of 21,807 COVID-19 deaths and 855,126 cases. Major General Dany Fortin, in charge of coordinating the rollout, said a total of 643,000 doses had been distributed this week, the highest amount yet. Canada says it is still on track to receive a total of 6 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna by the end of March and that anyone who wants a shot can get one by the end of September. Ontario, the most-populous province, has started to lift some restrictions imposed to combat a second wave of the virus even as experts say case rates are rising again. “We need to watch our every step. There is no easy path through a minefield,” Adalsteinn Brown, co-chair of the province’s science advisory panel, told reporters.

FILE PHOTO: A Canadian Border Service Agency officer walks between checkpoints at the Canada-United States border crossing at the Thousand Islands Bridge, which remains closed to non-essential traffic to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Lansdowne, Ontario, Canada September 28, 2020. REUTERS/Lars Hagberg The 30-day extension is the second announced under President Joe Biden and comes as U.S lawmakers in northern border states have urged lifting the nearly year-old restrictions to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In a notice Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said the three countries have all “determined that non-essential travel ... poses additional risk of transmission and spread of the virus.” Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair confirmed the extension of restrictions on Twitter. Canada has shown little interest in lifting the restrictions and last month imposed new COVID-19 testing requirements for some Canadians returning at land crossings. On Jan. 26, the U.S. government began requiring nearly all international air travelers to get negative COVID-19 test results within three days of travel but has no similar requirements for land border crossings. The Biden administration has spent weeks reviewing whether to impose COVID-19 testing requirements for land border crossings but has not issued new requirements. In an executive order in January, Biden directed U.S. officials to “immediately commence diplomatic outreach to the governments of Canada and Mexico regarding public health protocols for land ports of entry.” U.S. lawmakers say Americans who own property in Canada cannot maintain their homes. Border towns and businesses have been hard hit by the lack of cross-border traffic. Hundreds of thousands of people cross the U.S.-Mexico border daily, and Mexico has extremely limited COVID-19 testing capacity, U.S. officials say. Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky said at a March 2 hearing a vacationing Kentucky family recently tested positive in Mexico for COVID-19 and could not return to the United States on a flight. “They flew to Tijuana, walked across the border to the United States, got on an airplane in San Diego and then returned to Kentucky,” Massie said.

Slideshow ( 2 images ) The country’s top court said climate change is a threat to Canada a whole and upheld the legality of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which had been challenged by Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Carbon pricing, often called a carbon tax by opponents, is the lynchpin of the federal government’s plan to ultimately reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Ottawa will steadily ramp up the price of carbon to C$170 ($135.08) a ton by 2030, from C$30 a ton currently. Canada is the fourth-largest oil producer in the world and the fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter on a per capita basis. “Parliament has jurisdiction to enact this law as a matter of national concern,” Chief Justice Richard Wagner wrote in the ruling. “All parties to this proceeding agree that climate change is an existential challenge. It is a threat of the highest order to the country, and indeed to the world.” Under the carbon pricing act, Ottawa can impose a federal levy on provinces that do not have an adequate carbon pricing system of their own. Opposing provinces argued this infringed on their jurisdiction, but the Supreme Court ruled federal intervention was justified. The ruling was backed by six members of the nine-member court, with three dissenting opinions. “Today’s decision by the Supreme Court of Canada does not change our core conviction that the federal carbon tax is bad environmental policy, bad economic policy, and simply wrong,” Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said in a statement. Saskatchewan will unveil its own climate measures to avoid being subject to the “punitive and ineffective” federal tax, he added. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told a news conference the “disappointing” ruling undermined provincial authority, and set a dangerous precedent that allowed the federal government to overstep its constitutional powers. Ontario released a statement outlining its own environment plan, and Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy said the province would not stop investing in a green economy. Canada needs to cut emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 to fulfil its international climate commitments, which would involve slashing annual emissions to 511 megatons, compared with 729 megatons in 2018. The Liberals unveiled a strengthened climate plan last year aimed at reducing emissions to 503 megatons. “This decision is a win for the millions of Canadians who believe we must build a prosperous economy that fights climate change,” Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in a statement. Senior Liberals have said they expect a snap election in 2021, two years ahead of schedule, and the Supreme Court ruling is a boon for Trudeau ahead of a possible vote. The opposition Conservative party said they would repeal federal carbon pricing, if elected.

The budget deficit remains historically wide, with additional pandemic-related spending announced, but a path back to balance could be welcomed by bond investors and credit rating agencies. The province is one of the world’s largest sub-sovereign borrowers. The longer-term outlook gave investors a sense of how Ontario intends to tackle their high deficits, said Robert Hogue, a senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. “I think that will be viewed positively,” Hogue added. The deficit is seen narrowing to C$33.1 billion ($26.4 billion) in 2021-22, matching a November projection, but lower than the record C$38.5 billion deficit forecast for 2020-21, a budget document showed. The fiscal year begins on April 1. The deficit is then seen shrinking further in future years before swinging to a modest surplus in 2029-30. The deficit is “neither sustainable nor desirable forever” but is necessary to get through the pandemic and to recover stronger, said Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy, in prepared remarks. The economy is expected to grow by 4% in 2021 and 4.3% in 2022, with the pace then moderating in subsequent years. It contracted by an estimated 5.7% in 2020. The 2021 growth forecast for the province, which is home to manufacturers and Canada’s major financial center, was less than the 4.9% pace seen in November and slightly below the average of private-sector forecasts. With economic activity recovering, revenue is forecast to rise 1.4% to C$154 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, while expenses are seen falling to C$173 billion, a drop of 2.7%, as funding of COVID-19 programs dials back. Still, the province announced new support measures for health and the economy. It includes C$2.3 billion more for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing in 2021-22, as well as additional money for parents and small businesses. Pandemic-related spending was projected at C$51 billion over a four-year period, up from C$45 billion in November. The province forecast net-debt-to-GDP rising to 48.8% in 2021-22 from 47.1% in 2020-21. It is seen peaking at 50.5% in 2024-25 before gradually declining to 46.4% in 2029-30. The yield on Ontario’s 10-year bond was at 2.05% on Wednesday, down 2.1 basis points, in line with moves on other provincial bonds.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov Read More The United States on Thursday imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including curbs to its sovereign debt market, to punish it for interfering in last year’s U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions. The U.S. government blacklisted Russian companies, expelled Russian diplomats and barred U.S. banks from buying sovereign bonds from Russia's central bank, national wealth fund and Finance Ministry. The United States warned Russia that more penalties were possible but said it did not want to escalate. The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily, summoning the U.S. ambassador for a diplomatic dressing-down to tell him ""a series of retaliatory measures will follow soon."" A ministry spokeswoman also said a possible summit could be imperiled. Russia denies meddling in U.S. elections, orchestrating a cyber hack that used U.S. tech company SolarWinds Corp (SWI.N) to penetrate U.S. government networks and using a nerve agent to poison Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on Tuesday to Russian President Vladimir Putin to raise concerns about those issues and the buildup of Russian forces in Crimea and along the border with Ukraine, although a top U.S. general saw only a “low-to-medium” risk of a Russian invasion in the next few weeks. Biden, who also proposed a U.S.-Russian summit, is trying to strike a balance between deterring what Washington sees as hostile Russian behavior, while avoiding a deeper deterioration in U.S.-Russian ties and preserving some room for cooperation. ""My bottom line is this: There is an interest in the United States to work with Russia. We should and we will,"" Biden said in remarks to the press. But ""when Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond,"" he said. ""I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate."" Russia said Washington’s actions contradicted a stated U.S. desire to normalize relations with Moscow. The sanctions are hostile steps that heighten the countries’ confrontation, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. Among his moves, Biden signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. government to impose sanctions on any area of the Russian economy and used it to restrict Russia’s ability to issue sovereign debt to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2020 U.S. election. Biden barred U.S. financial institutions from taking part in the primary market for rouble-denominated Russian sovereign bonds from June 14. U.S. banks have been barred from taking part in the primary market for non-rouble sovereign bonds since 2019. He did not prohibit them, however, from buying such debt in the secondary market, a step likely to have a far more dramatic effect on the Russian bond and currency markets, which fell as news of the sanctions seeped out before recovering some losses. The Treasury also blacklisted 32 entities and individuals that it said had carried out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 presidential election and other ""acts of disinformation and interference."" ANALYST: RUSSIA TO CONTINUE TESTING U.S. In concert with the European Union, Britain, Australia and Canada, the Treasury also put sanctions on eight individuals associated with Moscow's occupation of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The White House said it was expelling 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including representatives of the Russian intelligence services, and for the first time, formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds hack. The agency said the allegations were “nonsense” and “windbaggery.” The U.S. government plans a new executive order to strengthen its cybersecurity, a U.S. official told reporters, suggesting it could include such elements as encryption and multifactor authentication. The White House also said it would respond to reports Russia had offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence agencies have ""low-to-moderate"" confidence in their assessment of those reports, in part because they rely on sometimes undependable testimony from detainees, it said. Russia has long brushed off allegations of putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. Andrew Weiss, a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank analyst, was skeptical the U.S. sanctions would change a ""largely competitive and adversarial relationship"" in the short term or deter Russia in the long term. ""I'd be surprised if today's very calibrated announcements by the Biden administration materially shift the relationship in either direction,"" he said, saying Russia was willing to cooperate on some issues but there was unlikely ever to be a meeting of the minds on Ukraine or election interference. ""I don't think it's realistic to expect the new sanctions will shift Russia's risk calculus in a fundamental fashion,"" he added. ""It's to be expected that the Russians will keep probing and testing our resolve."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

""There are around 30 groups within DarkSide that are attempting to hack companies all the time, and they succeeded this time with Toshiba,"" said Takashi Yoshikawa, a senior malware analyst at Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions.

Read our Editor's note on how we're helping professionals make smart decisions. Read more Skip to main content World Business Markets Breakingviews More Sign In Menu June 9, 20219:23 PM UTC Americas Canada takes cautious step toward lifting border restrictions, businesses fret David LjunggrenSteve Scherer 3 minute read 1/3 Peace Arch Park, one of the few places where families can gather due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) border restrictions, is seen in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada March 13, 2021. REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier Read More Canada on Wednesday took a cautious first step toward easing COVID-19 border restrictions, saying it was prepared to relax quarantine protocols for fully vaccinated citizens returning home starting in early July. Canada's air and land borders have allowed for only essential travel since March of last year, and people returning home are required to quarantine for 14 days. If they arrive by air, they also must stay in a designated hotel until they receive a negative COVID-19 test. ""The first step ... is to allow fully vaccinated individuals currently permitted to enter Canada to do so without the requirement to stay in government-authorized accommodation,"" Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters on Wednesday. The easing of restrictions will hinge on COVID-19 case numbers and vaccinations, she said. Canadian businesses, especially airlines and those that depend on tourism, have been lobbying the Liberal government to relax restrictions. Hajdu made clear Ottawa would act slowly. Asked about calls from businesses to lift restrictions starting on June 22, Hajdu said: ""We do want to be cautious and careful on these next steps to be sure that we are not putting that recovery in jeopardy."" The Canadian Airports Council said it was ""disappointed the new measures were not extended to all vaccinated travellers and that there is still no plan for a restart of travel"" while the Chamber of Commerce said much work remained. The opposition Conservatives, almost neck and neck in polls with the Liberals ahead of an election expected this year, demanded an end to the quarantine program and said ""Canadians can't afford more pandemic mismanagement from (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau."" By June 21, Canada is due to decide whether to extend land border restrictions with the United States. The measures do not affect trade. Hajdu said Canada would take a ""phased approach towards adjusting current border measures."" It is still unclear when the border rules might change for foreign travelers. There will be as many as seven phases, with borders not fully open until some 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, a source familiar with the matter said. Canada is working on a certificate that can be presented at the border as proof of vaccination, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters. Even if fully vaccinated, Canadians will be required to take a COVID-19 test before departure and upon arrival, and then quarantine until they receive a negative result, Hajdu said Some 70% of eligible Canadians have received a first shot, Procurement Minister Anita Anand said, while about 10% are fully vaccinated. Canada is due to get millions of doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines in June. This includes 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, with some coming for the first time from the United States. On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it was forming an expert working group with Canada to determine how best to safely restart travel. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio A year into the pandemic, Canada's national statistics agency is updating how it measures inflation, using new types of data for the first time as it bets on what lockdown spending shifts will prevail even as life returns more to normal. Statistics Canada's overdue re-weighting of its consumer price index (CPI) basket, set for release with June data, could give another bump to inflation which is already running hot. It also has implications for real return bonds, which compensate investors for changes in CPI. ""It's something that people are paying attention to ... because of how odd the period preceding it was,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""If it puts more weight on something that generally has a higher inflation rate, and takes away some of the weighting on things that just generally over many years have lower inflation, you are going to see the monthly numbers perk up,"" he said. Statscan rejigs the weights of its CPI basket on a biennial basis, with the 2021 update delayed by six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time, the agency is using real world inputs - like price scanners at grocery stores - and actual consumer outlays, along with its traditional survey of household spending, to determine the new weightings. The Bank of Canada targets inflation at 2%, with a 1%-3% control range. The central bank has said it expects inflation to be near the top end of its target band over the next few months due to the base-year effect, before dropping to around 2% later in 2021. In April, inflation rose at its fastest pace in a decade to 3.4%, mostly due to the statistical comparison to last year when prices tanked during early pandemic shutdowns. Statcan's alternate index, weighted to better reflect the impact of spending shifts due to the pandemic, has consistently tracked above official inflation. Canadians spent less on gasoline and travel in 2020, for example, but more on food and housing. Key to the rejig is a bet on just how much the pandemic shift in consumption habits will stick as vaccines roll out and Canadians return to a more normal life. ""For all we know we could go back to the same spending patterns we had before the pandemic,"" said Derek Holt, head of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank. ""I don't think so - I don't think we'll all be boarding cruise ships and packing movie theaters anytime soon, but maybe we will."" For bond investors, the tricky thing will be judging how a basket shakeup will change headline numbers, either up or down, particularly as some of the components that could be reduced in weight face sharp price rises as the economy reopens. ""Air fare inflation is going to be pretty high for the next year,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics. ""So if they reduce the weight of airlines they'd actually be reducing headline inflation by doing that."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Patrick Doyle/File Photo Read More A landmark deal by the Group of Seven advanced economies to pursue higher global taxation on large companies shows it is possible to end the ""race to the bottom"" and will benefit Canada, Canada's finance minister said on Saturday. Chrystia Freeland spoke with reporters after a meeting in London, where G7 countries agreed to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%. read more ""We've shown today that it is possible to end the global race to the bottom on taxation,"" Freeland told reporters. ""Multinational companies need to pay their fair share of taxes. Jurisdiction shopping allowed them to avoid doing that."" Freeland said the issue was of particular importance to Canada as a ""relatively high-tax country."" The measures will need to find broader agreement at a meeting of the G20 - which includes a number of emerging economies - due to take place next month in Venice. Important details remain to be negotiated over the coming months. When asked about the impact on Canadian companies, Freeland said: ""I'm not going to go into the specifics ... because I think it's still a little bit too early,"" adding that details need to be fleshed out. Freeland said Canada will still move ahead with its own planned digital services tax, similar to those already in place in other G7 countries, as the group continues to coordinate on a transition plan.

REUTERS/Aaron Harris Canada lost more jobs than expected in May amid continued lockdowns to curb a harsh third wave of COVID-19, data showed on Friday, but economists were quick to predict a rush of hiring in June as those restrictions ease. Some 68,000 jobs were lost in May, Statistics Canada said, more than the average analyst forecast for a loss of 20,000. The unemployment rate climbed to 8.2%, in line with expectations. Employment is now 3% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. ""I am hopeful that this is the last down-print we have before we release a fury of hiring activity starting in June,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of Capital Market Economics at Scotiabank. Many Canadian provinces are easing restrictions as new COVID-19 infections plummet and more Canadians get their jab. Canada has administered first doses to about 60% of its adult population, with just over 6% fully vaccinated. That should bolster the reopening of ""high-contact"" service sectors, where employment remains furthest below pre-pandemic levels, with hiring set to ramp up in subsequent months as businesses respond to a surge of pent-up demand. read more ""With households sitting on an exceptionally large stockpile of savings built up during the pandemic, that recovery could accelerate relatively quickly over the summer,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC, in a note. While the Canadian economy has not weathered the third of wave of infections quite as well as it did the second, the expected second-half boom should allow the Bank of Canada to look past the disappointing May numbers, economists said. ""The Bank of Canada will fully look through it,"" said Holt. ""(The data) will be less choppy as we go into the second half of the year."" The Bank of Canada is expected to taper its asset purchase program again in the third quarter and has signaled it could start hiking rates as soon as late 2022. read more Part-time and full-time employment both dropped in May, and jobs were lost in the goods sector for the first time since April 2020. Long-term unemployment held relatively steady, while the participation rate for core-age women fell for the second consecutive month in May, dipping back below pre-pandemic levels.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo TORONTO, June 17 (Reuters) - Canada's financial regulator raised the amount of capital the country's biggest lenders must hold to guard against risks to a record 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, from 1% currently, in a surprise move that could pave the way for them to resume dividend increases and share buybacks. The new measures, which take effect on Oct. 31, is a sign that the economic and market disruptions stemming from the coronavirus pandemic have abated and banks' capital levels have been resilient, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) said in a statement. But the regulator acknowledged that key vulnerabilities, including household and corporate debt levels, as well as asset imbalances caused by steep increase in home prices over the past year, remain. In a sign of concern about the housing market, OSFI and the Canadian government raised the benchmark to determine the minimum qualifying rate for mortgages, starting June 1. read more The increase in the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) to the highest possible level raises the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital - the core bank capital measure - to 10.5% of risk-weighted assets; a 4.5% base level, a ""capital conservation buffer"" of 2.5%, and a 1% surcharge for systemically important banks, plus the DSB. The change ""gives OSFI more leeway to loosen a restriction down the road, namely the freeze on buybacks and dividend increases,"" National Bank Financial Analyst Gabriel Dechaine said. OSFI felt it was ""useful for the banks to understand what our minimal capital expectations are and to give them time to adjust to that... ahead of any lifting of the temporary capital distribution restrictions,"" Assistant Superintendent Jamey Hubbs said on a media call. Even with the higher requirement, Canada's six biggest banks would have excess capital of about C$51 billion, dropping from C$82 billion as of April 30, according to Reuters calculations. That was driven in part by a moratorium on dividend increases and share buybacks imposed by OSFI in March 2020, although a pandemic-driven surge in loan losses has so far failed to materialize. The Canadian banks index (.GSPTXBA) slipped 0.25% in morning trading in Toronto, while the Toronto stock benchmark (.GSPTSE) fell 0.1%. The increase is the first since the last one announced in December 2019, which did not come into effect as planned in April 2020, as OSFI made an out-of-schedule change that dropped the rate to 1% in March. It has maintained that level at its twice yearly reviews. Prior to that, OSFI had raised the required level by 25 basis points at every twice yearly review since it was introduced at 1.5% in June 2018.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio OTTAWA, June 15 (Reuters) - Canada's Green Party was increasingly mired in an internal dispute over its position on Israel on Tuesday, and a news report said the bloc would hold a vote next month on whether to oust its leader, Annamie Paul, who was elected just eight months ago. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported that the Greens had triggered a process that could remove Paul, the first black person to head a mainstream Canadian party, beginning with a vote next month. A Green Party spokesperson declined to comment on the report, but said the party's ""federal council"" would meet later on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Paul, 48, rejected calls from the Quebec wing of the party for her to resign after a member of parliament left the Greens due to the Israel controversy. ""I believe that I have been given a strong mandate. I believe that I have been given the instructions to work on behalf of Canadians for a green recovery,"" Paul said at a news conference in Ottawa. Paul herself is not a member of parliament. The Greens - who champion the environment and the fight against climate change - had only three legislators in the 338-seat House of Commons and one, Jenica Atwin, abandoned the party last week to join the governing Liberals. Atwin has said that her exit was in large part due to a dispute over the party's stance on Israel. Atwin on Twitter has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians, while a senior adviser to Paul, Noah Zatzman, has posted on Facebook that some unspecified Green members of parliament are anti-Semitic. The party's executive committee voted last week not to renew Zatzman's contract, local media reported. Paul converted to Judaism some two decades ago after she married a Jewish man. While the Greens are the smallest faction in parliament, they perform well in British Colombia and hold two seats there. The current turmoil may favor their rivals ahead of a national election that senior Liberals say could be just a few months away. The Greens would win about 6.7% of the vote nationally if a vote were held now, according to an average of recent polls aggregated by the CBC.

REUTERS/Lars Hagberg/File Photo WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - U.S. and Canadian officials are set to meet Tuesday to discuss how to eventually lift pandemic-related border restrictions between the two countries, but no immediate action is expected, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Monday. U.S. and Canadian business leaders have voiced increasing concern about the ban on non-essential travel at land borders because of COVID-19 that was imposed in March 2020 and has been renewed on a monthly basis since. The measures, which also apply to the U.S.-Mexico border, do not affect trade or other essential travel. The current restrictions are set to expire June 21, but U.S. and industry officials expect they will be extended again. Reuters reported on June 8 the Biden administration was forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the United Kingdom to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions. A meeting is expected to occur with Mexico later this week and meetings with the United Kingdom and EU are currently set for next week, but the timing could still shift, three people briefed on the meetings said. U.S. restrictions prevent most non-U.S. citizens who have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil within the last 14 days from traveling to the United States. Reuters reported previously that U.S. and airline officials do not think U.S. restrictions will be lifted until around July 4 at the earliest. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday he has spoken with U.S. President Joe Biden about how to lift the restrictions, but made clear no breakthrough has been achieved. Two officials said the working groups are each expected to meet twice a month. Canada last week took a cautious first step, saying it was prepared to relax quarantine protocols for fully vaccinated citizens returning home starting in early July.

REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier TORONTO, June 9 (Reuters) - Canada has reached a proposed settlement with a group of indigenous survivors of the now-defunct residential schools for the abuse they suffered, a federal minister said on Wednesday, ending a 14-year fight for justice. The settlement comes as the government is scrambling to deal with a national outcry after the remains of 215 indigenous children were discovered at a former residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia. The government has been under pressure to stop legally opposing indigenous people’s requests for compensationand acknowledgement in court following the discovery. Under the latest agreement, the government will provide C$10,000 ($8,259.00) to each survivor involved in the class action lawsuit and create a C$50 million indigenous-led nonprofit to support wellbeing and cultural learning. The settlement does not include an explicit admission of wrongdoing by the government. Crown-Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said the plaintiffs had hoped for an official apology and ""while this is not part of a settlement agreement, we will be listening to their concerns, as we work together on this request."" The estimated 12,000 to 20,000 survivors in the lawsuit attended residential schools during the day and went home at night. Because of this, they were not included in a previous settlement for residential school survivors. Between 1831 and 1996, Canada's residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 indigenous children from their parents, bringing them to institutions with the stated purpose of assimilation. They were malnourished, beaten and sexually abused in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission called cultural genocide in its landmark 2015 report. The proposal is open for comments from plaintiffs until August 2021, and will be presented along with the comments to the court in September for approval. Bennett told reporters at a Wednesday news conference that the government will continue to work with survivors and their families and others to resolve remaining childhood claims. ""Together we will move forward on the path to reconciliation,"" she said. CANADA IS A ""REPEAT OFFENDER"" Several plaintiffs spoke at the conference, describing the pain the residential schools and the years-long lawsuit brought them. ""This has been a really long process, 14 years, returning to court, regurgitating trauma,"" Charlotte Gilbert, a representative for the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit, said. A separate class action, still ongoing, deals with residential schools' cultural damage and involves 105 indigenous bands. ""No amount of compensation can change the legacy of residential schools,"" Diena Jules, a survivor of the schools, said. ""Nothing can restore us to being whole."" The government remains embroiled in several ongoing lawsuits involving indigenous people in Canada. A Canadian Human Rights Tribunal case involving discrimination through the systemic under-funding of child and family services against indigenous children - resulting in a disproportionate number of indigenous children in foster care - has a hearing next week. The Canadian government has admitted its child and family services funding system ""was broken and needed immediate and substantial reform."" But in its most recent filings it argued the tribunal was the wrong venue for this dispute and that individual compensation was not appropriate in this instance. ""It's a really dangerous argument,"" said Cindy Blackstock, a member of the Gitxsan nation and executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, which brought the legal action. Canada is ""a repeat offender"" when it comes to abrogating the rights of indigenous children, she said. ""It needs a heavy hand for deterrence.""

REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier Read More OTTAWA, June 9 (Reuters) - Canada on Wednesday took a cautious first step toward easing COVID-19 border restrictions, saying it was prepared to relax quarantine protocols for fully vaccinated citizens returning home starting in early July. Canada's air and land borders have allowed for only essential travel since March of last year, and people returning home are required to quarantine for 14 days. If they arrive by air, they also must stay in a designated hotel until they receive a negative COVID-19 test. ""The first step ... is to allow fully vaccinated individuals currently permitted to enter Canada to do so without the requirement to stay in government-authorized accommodation,"" Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters on Wednesday. The easing of restrictions will hinge on COVID-19 case numbers and vaccinations, she said. Canadian businesses, especially airlines and those that depend on tourism, have been lobbying the Liberal government to relax restrictions. Hajdu made clear Ottawa would act slowly. Asked about calls from businesses to lift restrictions starting on June 22, Hajdu said: ""We do want to be cautious and careful on these next steps to be sure that we are not putting that recovery in jeopardy."" The Canadian Airports Council said it was ""disappointed the new measures were not extended to all vaccinated travellers and that there is still no plan for a restart of travel"" while the Chamber of Commerce said much work remained. The opposition Conservatives, almost neck and neck in polls with the Liberals ahead of an election expected this year, demanded an end to the quarantine program and said ""Canadians can't afford more pandemic mismanagement from (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau."" By June 21, Canada is due to decide whether to extend land border restrictions with the United States. The measures do not affect trade. Hajdu said Canada would take a ""phased approach towards adjusting current border measures."" It is still unclear when the border rules might change for foreign travelers. There will be as many as seven phases, with borders not fully open until some 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, a source familiar with the matter said. Canada is working on a certificate that can be presented at the border as proof of vaccination, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters. Even if fully vaccinated, Canadians will be required to take a COVID-19 test before departure and upon arrival, and then quarantine until they receive a negative result, Hajdu said Some 70% of eligible Canadians have received a first shot, Procurement Minister Anita Anand said, while about 10% are fully vaccinated. Canada is due to get millions of doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines in June. This includes 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, with some coming for the first time from the United States. On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it was forming an expert working group with Canada to determine how best to safely restart travel.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio/File Photo OTTAWA, June 4 (Reuters) - A year into the pandemic, Canada's national statistics agency is updating how it measures inflation, using new types of data for the first time as it bets on what lockdown spending shifts will prevail even as life returns more to normal. Statistics Canada's overdue re-weighting of its consumer price index (CPI) basket, set for release with June data, could give another bump to inflation which is already running hot. It also has implications for real return bonds, which compensate investors for changes in CPI. ""It's something that people are paying attention to ... because of how odd the period preceding it was,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""If it puts more weight on something that generally has a higher inflation rate, and takes away some of the weighting on things that just generally over many years have lower inflation, you are going to see the monthly numbers perk up,"" he said. Statscan rejigs the weights of its CPI basket on a biennial basis, with the 2021 update delayed by six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time, the agency is using real world inputs - like price scanners at grocery stores - and actual consumer outlays, along with its traditional survey of household spending, to determine the new weightings. The Bank of Canada targets inflation at 2%, with a 1%-3% control range. The central bank has said it expects inflation to be near the top end of its target band over the next few months due to the base-year effect, before dropping to around 2% later in 2021. In April, inflation rose at its fastest pace in a decade to 3.4%, mostly due to the statistical comparison to last year when prices tanked during early pandemic shutdowns. Statcan's alternate index, weighted to better reflect the impact of spending shifts due to the pandemic, has consistently tracked above official inflation. Canadians spent less on gasoline and travel in 2020, for example, but more on food and housing. Key to the rejig is a bet on just how much the pandemic shift in consumption habits will stick as vaccines roll out and Canadians return to a more normal life. ""For all we know we could go back to the same spending patterns we had before the pandemic,"" said Derek Holt, head of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank. ""I don't think so - I don't think we'll all be boarding cruise ships and packing movie theaters anytime soon, but maybe we will."" For bond investors, the tricky thing will be judging how a basket shakeup will change headline numbers, either up or down, particularly as some of the components that could be reduced in weight face sharp price rises as the economy reopens. ""Air fare inflation is going to be pretty high for the next year,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics. ""So if they reduce the weight of airlines they'd actually be reducing headline inflation by doing that.""

""Multinational companies need to pay their fair share of taxes. Jurisdiction shopping allowed them to avoid doing that.""

The measures will need to find broader agreement at a meeting of the G20 - which includes a number of emerging economies - due to take place next month in Venice. Important details remain to be negotiated over the coming months. When asked about the impact on Canadian companies, Freeland said: ""I'm not going to go into the specifics ... because I think it's still a little bit too early,"" adding that details need to be fleshed out. Freeland said Canada will still move ahead with its own planned digital services tax, similar to those already in place in other G7 countries, as the group continues to coordinate on a transition plan.

The vote sent gambling shares higher as it is seen helping them win back customers from offshore websites and U.S. casinos.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch OTTAWA, June 21 (Reuters) - Canadian retailers are readying for a post-pandemic rebound as consumers emerge from lockdowns and open their wallets, but higher costs are eroding their profit margins and fanning inflationary pressures. Skyrocketing transport and input costs - fueled by a global shipping container shortage and surging demand for raw materials - mean prices set a few months ago no longer make sense, especially when demand for goods is so high that certain products are selling out before they even arrive. Many retailers and importers are sacrificing margins to try to weather what they hope is a temporary imbalance as the world snaps back from the pandemic. But some are also increasing their prices and that is helping feed Canada's hottest inflation in a decade in May. read more While the Bank of Canada says the current period of high inflation is transitory, it warned this month that if supply imbalances persist, inflation might lead it to reduce stimulus more quickly than expected. read more For furniture importer Rachel Bourdages, the cost of getting shipments from India and China to Canada has quadrupled amid the shipping container shortage. Last year, she was paying around $4,000 per container. ""Last month, for the same container, it was $15,000. And this month ... it will be around $16,900,"" said Bourdages. Bourdages and others also are facing frequent price increases from their suppliers, who are grappling with surging costs for raw materials like wood and metals, along with labor shortages. Bourdages is increasing prices where she can, but it is not enough to make up for her added costs. And the shipping delays mean she is under pressure to order products months in advance, with no guarantee the price she gives her customers now will be sufficient by the time the goods arrive. It's not just small businesses feeling the pinch. Retailers like Canadian Tire (CTCa.TO) and parka maker Canada Goose (GOOS.TO) noted the cost impact of the global crunch in recent investor calls. And consumer prices for everything from clothing and shoes to furniture and cars have jumped on the year. Still, retail sales are expected to boom this summer and were already tracking about 5% higher in early June, according the RBC COVID Consumer Spending Tracker. The only bright spot for retailers has been the strong Canadian dollar, which has surged 9.6% in the last year, giving importers more purchasing power. ""When the Canadian dollar is stronger, that gives them at least a small buffer,"" said Diane Brisebois, chief executive of the Retail Council of Canada. But that buffer is not enough, particularly for furniture retailers and importers who as of May are facing a new anti-dumping tariff on upholstered sofas and chairs from China and Vietnam, two of the largest supplier markets. Love Dodd, who owns three furniture stores in British Columbia, canceled 35 containers he had on order rather than pay the tariff of up to 296%. The shipments he was unable to cancel or divert have cost him hundreds of thousands. “That’s not something I can pass on to my customers, I can’t say ‘Mr. and Mrs. Jones, that sofa you’ve got coming in, we have to charge you 296% extra,’” he said. “We’ll be eating the costs on that.” Reporting by Julie Gordon in Ottawa; Editing by Steve Orlofsky Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo Summary reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/fx-polls?RIC=CAD= poll data TORONTO, July 1 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar will strengthen over the coming year, bolstered by higher oil prices and reduced stimulus from the Bank of Canada, but gains could stop short of the currency's recent six-year high, a Reuters poll showed. The loonie has pulled back 3.2% since last month touching its strongest level since May 2015 near 1.20 per U.S. dollar, or 83.33 U.S. cents, pressured by the Federal Reserve's surprise shift to more hawkish guidance and worries the spreading Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus could slow a global economic recovery. Analysts say 1.20 is a key technical level for the currency. ""It may be difficult to quickly regain ground for the Canadian dollar in the very near term, with the risk of a fourth wave of the pandemic spreading,"" said Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins. Canada is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so the loonie is particularly sensitive to the global economic outlook. Oil on Monday reached its highest level since October 2018 at $74.45 a barrel while some analysts expect the Bank of Canada to cut the pace of bond purchases again at its next policy decision on July 14. read more In April, the BoC became the first central bank in the Group of Seven to reduce its pandemic support. Tapering could support the loonie but the BoC does not want the currency to reach a level that reduces the competitiveness of Canada's exports, said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics. ""Under 1.20, the Bank of Canada starts getting nervous,"" Simpson said. The median forecast of more than 40 strategists was for the Canadian dollar to strengthen 2.5% in six months to 1.21. It was then expected to pull back to 1.22 in one year, compared to a 1.21 forecast in June's poll. A risk to the loonie's outlook is a potential reassessment by markets of the order in which central banks begin lifting interest rates from record lows. Currently, money markets see the Bank of Canada moving ahead of the Fed, with a hike by about the middle of next year . But Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets expects the BoC to wait for the Fed to hike and to then tighten at a slower pace than the U.S. central bank. If the BoC tightens ""faster than the Fed then that puts untoward (upward) pressure on the loonie and we think the Bank of Canada is going to be keen to avoid that,"" Rai said. He expects the currency to weaken over the coming 12 months. Past rate hike cycles show faster liftoff by the BoC may not be sustained, particularly if the loonie overshoots. read more (For other stories from the latest Reuters foreign exchange poll: ) Reporting by Fergal Smith; polling by Sujith Pai and Swathi Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Christinne Muschi TORONTO, July 15 (Reuters) - Canada may permit fully vaccinated travellers into the country by early September, the country's prime minister said on Thursday, if the current trend in vaccination rate and public health conditions continue. Justin Trudeau made the remarks in a call with Canadian provincial leaders, according to a readout of the call released by his office. Trudeau also said there were ongoing discussions with the United States to begin allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents into Canada for non-essential travel by mid-August. ""The Prime Minister noted that, if our current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue, Canada would be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travellers from all countries by early September,"" according to a statement. Some 78% of people aged 12 years or older in Canada have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, health officials said recently. About 44% of people 12 years or older are fully vaccinated. Earlier on Thursday, Canada said it will allow large cruise ships to visit once again starting in November as the COVID-19 pandemic fades, but they must fully comply with public health requirements.

REUTERS/Blair Gable/File Photo OTTAWA, July 14 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada on Wednesday took a mostly optimistic stance on the country's economy, saying the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic had largely passed while warning inflation would remain hot in the near-term. The central bank held its key interest rate at a record low 0.25% and cut its weekly net purchases of Canadian government bonds to a target of C$2 billion, expressing confidence growth would rebound strongly and this time be more durable. ""The reopening of the economy and the strong progress on vaccinations have given us reason to be more optimistic about the direction of the economy,"" Governor Tiff Macklem told reporters after the rate decision. ""But we are not there yet, and we are mindful that the process is likely to be bumpy, and some scars will remain."" Earlier, the bank said that while the third pandemic wave had slowed Canada's economic growth in the first half of 2021, it should pick up in the third quarter. The central bank said Canada's economy is now expected to grow 6.0% in 2021, down from the April forecast of 6.5%, while it revised up its 2022 growth estimate to 4.6% from 3.7%. ""The downside risks associated with the pandemic have significantly diminished,"" the bank said in its summer monetary policy report. Inflation is expected to remain at or above 3% - the top of the bank's 1%-3% control range - through the rest of 2021, easing back to the 2% target by 2022. Macklem made clear the pressure on inflation is seen as transitory, reiterating that economic slack would be fully absorbed in the second half of 2022. ""There's no indication that these strong inflation readings are forcing the bank to reevaluate their monetary policy,"" said Josh Nye, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. The central bank is expected to further trim its bond-buying program this year, setting the stage for a rate hike as soon as late 2022. But higher rates could come sooner, said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Economics. ""The 'later' risks would be driven by the virus, while the 'sooner' risks could arise if inflation remains stubbornly high and/or if growth is juiced more than expected by well-supported consumers,"" he said in a note. On employment, which lags pre-pandemic levels by roughly 500,000 jobs, a strong rebound is expected over the coming months and the central bank hinted that despite high long-term unemployment, scarring may not be as bad as initially thought. ""The workers most affected by the pandemic - namely, young people and workers with fewer skills - may face less risk of skills erosion,"" the bank said. The Canadian dollar was little changed on Wednesday, trading at 1.2510 to the greenback, or 79.93 U.S. cents.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren Read More TORONTO, July 13 (Reuters) - Canadian municipalities reeling from a pandemic-driven hit to revenues are facing an added blow from surging liability insurance costs, forcing them to raise property taxes or even cut services for residents. The increase in premiums, about 20% to 30% in many cases, has been driven by a shrinking pool of insurers, more claims in an increasingly litigious climate and uncertainty around payout amounts. Cities need insurance to protect against claims in the event of accidents on municipal properties or roads, and to deal with risks including cyber attacks and natural disasters - so forgoing coverage is not an option. The 444 municipalities in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, would face a combined revenue shortfall of about C$2.4 billion ($1.9 billion) due to the pandemic, Ontario's Financial Accountability Office (FAO) said in December. ""Any unanticipated increase in costs can come as a surprise,"" although municipalities do have some funds for contingencies, said Travis Shaw, senior vice-president for public finance at DBRS Morningstar. If higher property taxes - the most reliable source of revenue at a time when other income, such as transit fees, has been decimated due to lockdowns - become unaffordable for residents, ""the other alternative is cutting expenses and reducing services,"" he said. ""They're required by law to get to a balanced budget."" The biggest revenue losses have been in transit, recreation and other fees, while the biggest expenses were for temporary housing and shelters and other social services, Ontario's FAO said. Larger cities have had the biggest hit to revenues due to transit-fee declines, but many smaller municipalities have faced big cost challenges, as many families, taking advantage of what appears to be a permanent shift to working from home, at least part-time, have fled large cities for smaller towns in search of more space and affordable housing. This has put pressure on these towns to fast-track expensive infrastructure and service projects. read more SMALL POOL While the bigger tax bases help, that benefit is ""consumed by the cost to service"" the growth, said Sandra Zwiers, director of finance for the County of Essex, about 350 kilometers southwest of downtown Toronto, which has received an influx of residents from around the city. Essex County had a premium increase of 13%, or C$115,780, for this fiscal year, following a 10.6% rise the previous year, Zwiers said. Accident-related lawsuits against cities and settlements have risen alongside cyber attacks and natural disasters, both domestically and globally, even as bond yields have slid, resulting in more stringent underwriting standards and higher premiums around the world. While cities elsewhere, including in the United States, have also faced higher costs, there has been an outsized impact on Canadian municipalities due to a small pool of insurers, smaller populations and the legal requirement for municipalities to have joint and several liability (J&S) coverage, according to DBRS Morningstar. J&S covers the share of settlement amounts other at-fault parties are responsible for when they cannot pay them, so that the plaintiff is not short-changed. Alongside rising premiums, some towns face higher deductibles, and the removal of some coverage, including environmental impairment and cyber. Essex County's deductible rose to C$100,000 per occurrence last year, from C$25,000 previously. For Bracebridge, a town in the cottage district of Muskoka, some 175 kilometers north of Toronto, a C$160,000 increase in expenses in a year raises property taxes by 1%, said its mayor, Graydon Smith, who is also president of the Association of Municipalities Ontario. ""The frustration comes from the fact that we could (manage risks) as well as anybody can do, but that still doesn't stop the 30% increase"" Bracebridge has seen this year, Smith said. What may be deemed inadequate risk management, meanwhile, could result in bigger hikes, he added. Municipalities in insurance pools have controlled costs better but even they are not immune. Ontario's Waterloo region has an eight-municipality pool, funded by levies on members, with settlements split between the city at fault, the pool and the excess insurance provider. Despite being considered lower-risk than other cities, premiums in Waterloo rose a ""modest"" 9.8% last year, and a ""significant"" increase is expected this year, said Brian McEnhill, risk manager for the insurance pool. McEnhill attributed the increases partly to more claims - particularly higher-valued ones that have the region relying more on its insurer - and a diminishing pool of underwriters. EXITING INSURERS Consolidation has shrunk the insurance market, most notably the 2019 acquisition of Frank Cowan Company, Canada's biggest municipal insurance provider, by Intact Financial Corp (IFC.TO). An Intact spokesperson declined to comment. Lloyd's syndicates, including MS Amlin, as well as the Ontario Municipal Insurance Exchange (OMEX), which enabled cities to group together to self-insure, are among those who have left the Canadian municipal market in the last few years. OMEX attributed its suspension in part to J&S. ""Underwriters only have a certain amount of premium dollars,"" said David Richards, chief executive of specialty insurance brokerage EQUA Specialty Risk Partners Corporation. ""If they're historically losing money on municipal insurance ... then capacity shrinks. As a result, they focus on where they can make money."" Although J&S is not unique to municipal policies, the perception of governments as deep-pocketed has driven outsized payouts, said Pete Karageorgos, consumer and industry relations director at the Insurance Bureau of Canada. A growing number of towns in Ontario are renewing calls to do away with J&S, but the government remains unconvinced. The province needs certainty that a change would mean a decline in insurance rates, and there is not enough data ""to confidently draw a causal connection,"" a spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General said. Blaming J&S is a ""red herring,"" said Ontario Trial Lawyers Association President Kris Bonn. ""It's a more fair system to have the innocently injured victim be made whole for their losses,"" he said. ""The municipality can still go after the other defendant if they pay more than their proportionate share.""

REUTERS/Aaron Harris OTTAWA, July 9 (Reuters) - Canada added more jobs than expected in June, bringing employment within 1.8% of pre-pandemic levels, data showed on Friday, with economists eyeing a potential return to higher employment levels by year-end. The country added 230,700 jobs in June, beating analyst expectations of 195,000, as public health restrictions were eased in several regions, Statistics Canada said. The unemployment rate was 7.8%, just short of expectations of 7.7%. ""The details of the increase were less impressive than the headline, with all of the gain coming from part-time work,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC Economics, in a note. ""But with virus containment measures continuing to ease, more sizeable labor market improvements are expected in months to come,"" he added. The release of the June data was delayed Friday morning by an technical issue with Statscan's website. Part-time employment rose by 263,900, led by strong gains in youth employment, mostly among young women, while full-time employment fell by 33,200. The service sector added 278,600 jobs, mostly in high-contact services like accommodation and food, while goods sector employment fell by 48,000. Ontario, Canada's most populous province, loosened some restrictions in early June, allowing limited in-person shopping and dining, but many other businesses remain shuttered. As the reopening expands, employment is expected to balloon. ""I think it's very feasible that we regain, if not all, then most of the jobs lost during the pandemic by the end of this year,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of Capital Market Economics at Scotiabank. The strong June gain also supports an expectation that the Bank of Canada will again taper its asset purchase program, potentially as soon as next week. The central bank will update its forecasts as part of its regular rate decision on July 14. ""A very strong report reinforces the idea that the Bank of Canada should be announcing another round of tapering next week,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2471 to the greenback, or 80.19 U.S. cents, after the data.

REUTERS/Lars Hagberg Read More WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday extended the closure of land borders with Canada and Mexico to non-essential travel such as tourism through Aug. 21 even as officials debate whether to require visitors to have received a COVID-19 vaccine. The latest 30-day extension by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) came after Canada said on Monday it would start allowing in fully vaccinated U.S. visitors on Aug. 9 for non-essential travel after the COVID-19 pandemic forced a 16-month ban that many businesses have called crippling. ""We rely on the guidance of our health and medical experts, not on the actions of other countries,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, declining to offer any timetable for when the administration might ease travel restrictions that bar much of the world from the United States. One difficult question for President Joe Biden's administration is whether to follow Canada's lead and require all visitors to be vaccinated for COVID-19 before entering the United States, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. The White House plans a new round of high-level meetings this week to discuss the travel restrictions and the potential of mandating COVID-19 vaccines for visitors, but no decisions have been made, the sources said. The review comes amid increasing concern among U.S. officials about the Delta variant. U.S. health officials have reported sizable increases in COVID-19 cases and deaths, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. The White House last month launched interagency working groups with the European Union, Britain, Canada and Mexico to look at how eventually to lift travel and border restrictions. Asked on Friday about when the United States would lift European travel restrictions,Biden said he would ""be able to answer that question to you within the next several days — what is likely to happen."" Businesses in Canada and the United States, particularly the travel and airline industries, have pushed for an end to restrictions on non-essential travel between the two countries, which were imposed in March 2020, early in the pandemic. Since then, the land border has remained closed to all non-essential travel. The United States has allowed Canadians to fly in, although they must first receive a negative COVID-19 test, as do nearly all U.S.-bound international air travelers. Canada has not allowed Americans to do the same. Travelers crossing U.S. land borders on essential business do not need negative COVID-19 tests. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, a business group, criticized the latest U.S. extension. The chamber's chief executive, Perrin Beatty, said the U.S. move ""flies in the face of both science and the most recent public health data."" ""It's hard to see how allowing fully vaccinated Canadians to enter the U.S. poses a public health threat when travel within the U.S. is unrestricted,"" Beatty added. The United States has continued to extend the restrictions on Canada and Mexico on a monthly basis since March 2020. Airlines and others have urged Biden's administration to lift restrictions covering most non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in Britain, the 26 nations in Europe without border controls as well as Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil. The U.S. land border restrictions do not bar U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents returning to the United States. As in prior extensions, DHS said it could still seek to amend or rescind the restrictions before Aug. 21.

Justin Trudeau made the remarks in a call with Canadian provincial leaders, according to a readout of the call released by his office. Trudeau also said there were ongoing discussions with the United States to begin allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents into Canada for non-essential travel by mid-August. ""The Prime Minister noted that, if our current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue, Canada would be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travellers from all countries by early September,"" according to a statement. Some 78% of people aged 12 years or older in Canada have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, health officials said recently. About 44% of people 12 years or older are fully vaccinated. Earlier on Thursday, Canada said it will allow large cruise ships to visit once again starting in November as the COVID-19 pandemic fades, but they must fully comply with public health requirements.

REUTERS/Blair Gable/File Photo OTTAWA, July 14 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada on Wednesday took a mostly optimistic stance on the country's economy, saying the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic had largely passed while warning inflation would remain hot in the near-term. The central bank held its key interest rate at a record low 0.25% and cut its weekly net purchases of Canadian government bonds to a target of C$2 billion, expressing confidence growth would rebound strongly and this time be more durable. ""The reopening of the economy and the strong progress on vaccinations have given us reason to be more optimistic about the direction of the economy,"" Governor Tiff Macklem told reporters after the rate decision. ""But we are not there yet, and we are mindful that the process is likely to be bumpy, and some scars will remain."" Earlier, the bank said that while the third pandemic wave had slowed Canada's economic growth in the first half of 2021, it should pick up in the third quarter. The central bank said Canada's economy is now expected to grow 6.0% in 2021, down from the April forecast of 6.5%, while it revised up its 2022 growth estimate to 4.6% from 3.7%. ""The downside risks associated with the pandemic have significantly diminished,"" the bank said in its summer monetary policy report. Inflation is expected to remain at or above 3% - the top of the bank's 1%-3% control range - through the rest of 2021, easing back to the 2% target by 2022. Macklem made clear the pressure on inflation is seen as transitory, reiterating that economic slack would be fully absorbed in the second half of 2022. ""There's no indication that these strong inflation readings are forcing the bank to reevaluate their monetary policy,"" said Josh Nye, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. The central bank is expected to further trim its bond-buying program this year, setting the stage for a rate hike as soon as late 2022. But higher rates could come sooner, said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Economics. ""The 'later' risks would be driven by the virus, while the 'sooner' risks could arise if inflation remains stubbornly high and/or if growth is juiced more than expected by well-supported consumers,"" he said in a note. On employment, which lags pre-pandemic levels by roughly 500,000 jobs, a strong rebound is expected over the coming months and the central bank hinted that despite high long-term unemployment, scarring may not be as bad as initially thought. ""The workers most affected by the pandemic - namely, young people and workers with fewer skills - may face less risk of skills erosion,"" the bank said. The Canadian dollar was little changed on Wednesday, trading at 1.2510 to the greenback, or 79.93 U.S. cents.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren Read More TORONTO, July 13 (Reuters) - Canadian municipalities reeling from a pandemic-driven hit to revenues are facing an added blow from surging liability insurance costs, forcing them to raise property taxes or even cut services for residents. The increase in premiums, about 20% to 30% in many cases, has been driven by a shrinking pool of insurers, more claims in an increasingly litigious climate and uncertainty around payout amounts. Cities need insurance to protect against claims in the event of accidents on municipal properties or roads, and to deal with risks including cyber attacks and natural disasters - so forgoing coverage is not an option. The 444 municipalities in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, would face a combined revenue shortfall of about C$2.4 billion ($1.9 billion) due to the pandemic, Ontario's Financial Accountability Office (FAO) said in December. ""Any unanticipated increase in costs can come as a surprise,"" although municipalities do have some funds for contingencies, said Travis Shaw, senior vice-president for public finance at DBRS Morningstar. If higher property taxes - the most reliable source of revenue at a time when other income, such as transit fees, has been decimated due to lockdowns - become unaffordable for residents, ""the other alternative is cutting expenses and reducing services,"" he said. ""They're required by law to get to a balanced budget."" The biggest revenue losses have been in transit, recreation and other fees, while the biggest expenses were for temporary housing and shelters and other social services, Ontario's FAO said. Larger cities have had the biggest hit to revenues due to transit-fee declines, but many smaller municipalities have faced big cost challenges, as many families, taking advantage of what appears to be a permanent shift to working from home, at least part-time, have fled large cities for smaller towns in search of more space and affordable housing. This has put pressure on these towns to fast-track expensive infrastructure and service projects. read more SMALL POOL While the bigger tax bases help, that benefit is ""consumed by the cost to service"" the growth, said Sandra Zwiers, director of finance for the County of Essex, about 350 kilometers southwest of downtown Toronto, which has received an influx of residents from around the city. Essex County had a premium increase of 13%, or C$115,780, for this fiscal year, following a 10.6% rise the previous year, Zwiers said. Accident-related lawsuits against cities and settlements have risen alongside cyber attacks and natural disasters, both domestically and globally, even as bond yields have slid, resulting in more stringent underwriting standards and higher premiums around the world. While cities elsewhere, including in the United States, have also faced higher costs, there has been an outsized impact on Canadian municipalities due to a small pool of insurers, smaller populations and the legal requirement for municipalities to have joint and several liability (J&S) coverage, according to DBRS Morningstar. J&S covers the share of settlement amounts other at-fault parties are responsible for when they cannot pay them, so that the plaintiff is not short-changed. Alongside rising premiums, some towns face higher deductibles, and the removal of some coverage, including environmental impairment and cyber. Essex County's deductible rose to C$100,000 per occurrence last year, from C$25,000 previously. For Bracebridge, a town in the cottage district of Muskoka, some 175 kilometers north of Toronto, a C$160,000 increase in expenses in a year raises property taxes by 1%, said its mayor, Graydon Smith, who is also president of the Association of Municipalities Ontario. ""The frustration comes from the fact that we could (manage risks) as well as anybody can do, but that still doesn't stop the 30% increase"" Bracebridge has seen this year, Smith said. What may be deemed inadequate risk management, meanwhile, could result in bigger hikes, he added. Municipalities in insurance pools have controlled costs better but even they are not immune. Ontario's Waterloo region has an eight-municipality pool, funded by levies on members, with settlements split between the city at fault, the pool and the excess insurance provider. Despite being considered lower-risk than other cities, premiums in Waterloo rose a ""modest"" 9.8% last year, and a ""significant"" increase is expected this year, said Brian McEnhill, risk manager for the insurance pool. McEnhill attributed the increases partly to more claims - particularly higher-valued ones that have the region relying more on its insurer - and a diminishing pool of underwriters. EXITING INSURERS Consolidation has shrunk the insurance market, most notably the 2019 acquisition of Frank Cowan Company, Canada's biggest municipal insurance provider, by Intact Financial Corp (IFC.TO). An Intact spokesperson declined to comment. Lloyd's syndicates, including MS Amlin, as well as the Ontario Municipal Insurance Exchange (OMEX), which enabled cities to group together to self-insure, are among those who have left the Canadian municipal market in the last few years. OMEX attributed its suspension in part to J&S. ""Underwriters only have a certain amount of premium dollars,"" said David Richards, chief executive of specialty insurance brokerage EQUA Specialty Risk Partners Corporation. ""If they're historically losing money on municipal insurance ... then capacity shrinks. As a result, they focus on where they can make money."" Although J&S is not unique to municipal policies, the perception of governments as deep-pocketed has driven outsized payouts, said Pete Karageorgos, consumer and industry relations director at the Insurance Bureau of Canada. A growing number of towns in Ontario are renewing calls to do away with J&S, but the government remains unconvinced. The province needs certainty that a change would mean a decline in insurance rates, and there is not enough data ""to confidently draw a causal connection,"" a spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General said. Blaming J&S is a ""red herring,"" said Ontario Trial Lawyers Association President Kris Bonn. ""It's a more fair system to have the innocently injured victim be made whole for their losses,"" he said. ""The municipality can still go after the other defendant if they pay more than their proportionate share.""

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Read More BOSTON, July 27 (Reuters) - Corporate diversity has become the most common type of sustainability metric used in setting executive pay, a new study found, as companies look to increase the share of women and minorities in their workforces. Among 61 metrics used by Fortune 100 companies to tie executive pay to environmental, social or governance factors, 14 of them, or 23%, were diversity metrics, according to Nathan Grantz, senior research analyst at compensation consultant Equilar. In all, 44 companies use one or more ESG metrics, including seven that adopted them this year, Equilar found. The new attention to diversity reflects last year's Black Lives Matter protests and the social stratification laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Amit Batish, Equilar director of content. Both trends made big asset managers more interested in having executives tie pay to new goals, as retail investors pour billions of dollars into funds using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to pick stocks. (https://reut.rs/3eOKOmI) ""Investors and key stakeholders are putting more pressure on companies, and that's why these ESG metrics are becoming more prevalent,"" Batish said. One company that added diversity metrics is insurer Allstate Corp (ALL.N), which said in an April 12 securities filing that it would measure executives' progress against factors including ""inclusive diversity and equity strategies"" when setting their annual cash bonuses. Allstate representatives did not comment. Separately, in an April 2 filing, retailer CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) said it would modify, by as much as 10%, certain payouts to senior leaders with a new metric to ""assess our progress in achieving greater diverse leadership representation"" in 2021.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau named Mary Simon - a former journalist, ambassador, and Inuit community advocate - to serve as the representative in Canada of its head of state, Queen Elizabeth, earlier this month. Simon is the first indigenous person to take on the role, created more than 400 years ago to represent the colonial power on North American soil. The change comes as Canada grapples with the legacy of its treatment of indigenous people. ""We need people like Ms. Simon because we need people who build bridges and bring us together,"" Trudeau said at the ceremony. 1/5 Mary Simon conducts an inspection of the guard after being sworn in as Canada's first indigenous Governor General during a ceremony in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada July 26, 2021.

""I have heard from Canadians who describe a renewed sense of possibility for our country and hope that I can bring people together,"" Simon, 73, said after being installed. The ceremony, broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp also in Simon's native Inuktitut language, was scaled back and masks were worn due to COVID-19. A drummer accompanied her entry into the Senate where she took an oath. The governor general performs functions such as swearing in governments and formally signing legislation, but is also the commander in chief of the military and can summon or dissolve Parliament.

Video taken June 27, 2021. TWITTER @CANADIANBYLUCK via REUTERS/File Photo Read More July 26 (Reuters) - Cyprus. Cuba. Turkey. Canada. Northern Ireland. Antarctica. All recorded their hottest-ever temperatures in the last two years, and according to a new study, more such extremes are coming. In the next three decades, ""record-shattering"" heat waves could become two to seven times more frequent in the world than in the last 30 years, scientists report in a study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Beyond 2050, if current greenhouse gas emissions trends continue, such record-breaking heat waves could be three to 21 times more frequent, the study found. Even with the records seen in 2021, ""we haven't seen anything close to the most intense heat waves possible under today's climate, let alone the ones we expect to see in the coming decades,"" said co-author Erich Fischer, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich. For the study, the researchers used climate modeling to calculate the likelihood of record-breaking heat that lasted at least seven days and far surpassed earlier records. Communities preparing for climate change need to be preparing for such extremes, he said. ""Every time record temperatures or precipitation go well beyond what we've experienced during our lifetime, that's usually when we're unprepared and the damage is largest,"" Fischer said. Last month's Canadian heat wave killed hundreds of people and reached 121 Fahrenheit (49.6 Celsius) - an eye-popping 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4.6 degrees Celsius) above the country's previous record, set in 1937. ""We should no longer be surprised if we see records smashed by large margins,"" Fischer said. If greenhouse gas emissions are aggressively cut, the likelihood of heat waves would remain high but the chances of exceeding records would eventually fall over time, the study suggests. The new research shows that ""we must expect extreme event records to be broken - not just by small margins, but quite often by very large ones,"" climate scientist Rowan Sutton at the University of Reading's National Centre for Atmospheric Science said in a statement. ""This highlights the huge challenge to improve preparedness, build resilience and adapt society to conditions that have never previously been experienced,"" Sutton said. The study was released as scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change begin two weeks of virtual meetings to finalize their next global climate science assessment.

REUTERS/Lars Hagberg Read More WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday extended the closure of land borders with Canada and Mexico to non-essential travel such as tourism through Aug. 21 even as officials debate whether to require visitors to have received a COVID-19 vaccine. The latest 30-day extension by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) came after Canada said on Monday it would start allowing in fully vaccinated U.S. visitors on Aug. 9 for non-essential travel after the COVID-19 pandemic forced a 16-month ban that many businesses have called crippling. ""We rely on the guidance of our health and medical experts, not on the actions of other countries,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, declining to offer any timetable for when the administration might ease travel restrictions that bar much of the world from the United States. One difficult question for President Joe Biden's administration is whether to follow Canada's lead and require all visitors to be vaccinated for COVID-19 before entering the United States, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. The White House plans a new round of high-level meetings this week to discuss the travel restrictions and the potential of mandating COVID-19 vaccines for visitors, but no decisions have been made, the sources said. The review comes amid increasing concern among U.S. officials about the Delta variant. U.S. health officials have reported sizable increases in COVID-19 cases and deaths, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates. The White House last month launched interagency working groups with the European Union, Britain, Canada and Mexico to look at how eventually to lift travel and border restrictions. Asked on Friday about when the United States would lift European travel restrictions,Biden said he would ""be able to answer that question to you within the next several days — what is likely to happen."" Businesses in Canada and the United States, particularly the travel and airline industries, have pushed for an end to restrictions on non-essential travel between the two countries, which were imposed in March 2020, early in the pandemic. Since then, the land border has remained closed to all non-essential travel. The United States has allowed Canadians to fly in, although they must first receive a negative COVID-19 test, as do nearly all U.S.-bound international air travelers. Canada has not allowed Americans to do the same. Travelers crossing U.S. land borders on essential business do not need negative COVID-19 tests. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, a business group, criticized the latest U.S. extension. The chamber's chief executive, Perrin Beatty, said the U.S. move ""flies in the face of both science and the most recent public health data."" ""It's hard to see how allowing fully vaccinated Canadians to enter the U.S. poses a public health threat when travel within the U.S. is unrestricted,"" Beatty added. The United States has continued to extend the restrictions on Canada and Mexico on a monthly basis since March 2020. Airlines and others have urged Biden's administration to lift restrictions covering most non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in Britain, the 26 nations in Europe without border controls as well as Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil. The U.S. land border restrictions do not bar U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents returning to the United States. As in prior extensions, DHS said it could still seek to amend or rescind the restrictions before Aug. 21.

REUTERS/Christinne Muschi/File Photo OTTAWA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Canada unexpectedly posted a trade surplus of C$3.23 billion ($2.58 billion) in June, the largest in almost 13 years, as exports jumped on higher shipments of oil and autos, Statistics Canada data indicated on Thursday. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a trade deficit of C$0.68 billion in June. The surplus was the largest since the C$3.45 billion recorded in September 2008. Exports leapt by 8.7%, the biggest increase since July 2020, to hit a record high C$53.76 billion as economies continue their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. ""This is a very pleasant surprise,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Canada's export development agency. ""International supply chains are becoming less encumbered and ... fundamental underlying demand that has been with us all the way along is actually manifesting itself in growth,"" he said by phone. The value of crude oil exports rose by 25.7% on higher volumes after a slowdown in production in April and May. Exports of motor vehicles and parts - hobbled in recent months by a shortage of computer chips - rose by 14.9% but remain more than 8% lower than in June 2020. ""The auto sector is still struggling to cope with shortages and, with energy exports now close to a record high, the scope for further gains is limited,"" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a note. The shortages also helped cut imports of autos and parts, which fell 3.8%. Overall imports dipped by 1.0%. Royce Mendes, senior economist with CIBC, said in a note that exports of goods and services ""should provide less of a drag on GDP in the second quarter than previously anticipated"". The Canadian dollar held onto earlier gains, trading at C$1.2504 to the U.S. dollar, or 80.0 U.S. cents.

Government data showed a seven-hour wait for the Fort Frances, Ontario, and International Falls, Minnesota, crossing. Fort Frances advertises itself online as ""rarely experiencing delays."" Several crossings in Ontario and New Brunswick - between the states of New York and Maine - had waits of three hours. Canada barred all leisure travel from the United States in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But as of Aug. 9 fully vaccinated Americans are able to enter the country. International travelers who are fully vaccinated will be allowed to enter in early September. Late on Friday, the Canadian government and border staff reached a tentative deal to end a strike that began earlier in the day and caused delays even before Americans began arriving. read more Toronto's Pearson International Airport, Canada's biggest, has also asked travelers to brace for delays as American leisure travelers return. Canada's partial reopening comes just as new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the United States hit a six-month high. read more Prior to the pandemic, tourism was the fifth-largest industry in Canada, contributing C$105 billion ($83.4 billion) to GDP and providing one in 10 jobs, according to the Tourism Industry Association of Canada. 1/7 Travellers line up to enter Canada after border restrictions were loosened to allow fully vaccinated U.S. residents, after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced an unprecedented 16-month ban that many businesses complained was crippling them, at the Peace Arch border crossing in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada August 9, 2021. REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier Read More The border reopening, however, and the rules surrounding it may not be enough to save Canada's outdoor tourism sector. Hunting and fishing lodges in remote parts of the country - most of which rely on American tourists for business - are reporting cancellations of people who do not want to get fully vaccinated or comply with the 14-day quarantine. ""We wish we would have been able to open a month ago, and we wish that now that we are open the rules were easier to understand,"" said Dominic Dugré, president of the Canadian Federation of Outfitter Associations. Remote lodges are struggling to accommodate the multiple negative COVID-19 tests required of travelers. Ken Gangler, 61, has owned three lodges in Manitoba over the past 37 years. The current one is 370 kms (230 miles) from the closest road, and accessible only via air. ""We're scrambling to open up but because there was such little notice from the government, the airlines don't have planes on the routes,"" he said. Gangler's son and his partner paid C$3,900 ($3,103.37) for two round trip airline tickets from Orlando, Florida, to Winnipeg, compared with C$1,300 before the pandemic. ""People don't want to pay these astronomical air fares,"" Gangler said, adding that staff shortage is another issue.

Reuters reported this week the extension was expected. The latest restrictions extend the prohibitions beyond the end of the busy U.S. summer tourism season. Airline officials say it will be at least weeks and potentially months before any U.S. travel restrictions are lifted, citing the rising number of COVID-19 cases. The U.S. land border restrictions do not bar U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents from returning to the United States. Separate from the Canada and Mexico land border restrictions, the United States bars most non-U.S. citizens who within the last 14 days have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen countries in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil. The White House confirmed on Aug. 5 it may require visitors from abroad to be vaccinated as part of its plans to eventually reopen international travel but it had yet to decide and would not immediately lift restrictions.

HYBRIT, owned by SSAB (SSABa.ST), state-owned utility Vattenfall (VATN.UL) and miner LKAB, said it would deliver the steel to truck-maker Volvo AB (VOLVb.ST) as a trial run before full commercial production in 2026. ""I'm happy to be minister for enterprise and energy in a country where industry is bubbling with energy for a (green) reset,"" Ibrahim Baylan, Minister for Business, Industry and Innovation, told a press conference on Wednesday. HYBRIT started test operations at its pilot plant for fossil-free steel in Lulea, northern Sweden, a year ago. A worker climbs on steel bars at a construction site of a subway in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China August 14, 2018. Chengdu Economic Daily REUTERS/Stringer It aims to replace coking coal, traditionally needed for ore-based steel making, with fossil-free electricity and hydrogen. Hydrogen is a key part of the EU's plan to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. SSAB, which accounts for 10% of Sweden's and 7% of Finland's carbon dioxide emissions, said the trial delivery was an ""important step towards a completely fossil-free value chain"". ""The goal is to deliver fossil-free steel to the market and demonstrate the technology on an industrial scale as early as 2026,"" it said in a statement. Another green steel venture, H2 Green Steel, is planning to build a fossil fuel-free steel plant in the north of Sweden, including a sustainable hydrogen facility, with production starting in 2024.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren Read More OTTAWA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Canada's ruling Liberal Party said on Wednesday that if re-elected it would raise corporate taxes on the most profitable banks and insurers to help pay for the cost of the COVID-19 recovery. The Liberals said they would hike the rate to 18% from 15% on all earnings over C$1 billion ($793 million) and vowed to establish a special dividend, so that those same institutions contribute more. The measures are expected to generate C$2.5 billion per year over four years, starting in 2022/23. Polls show the Liberals, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have a slender lead over their Conservative rivals ahead of the Sept. 20 election. ""Given that our banks have posted extraordinarily large profits, have continued to be incredibly successful, including through a pandemic ... we're going to ask them to do a little bit more,"" Trudeau told a campaign event in British Columbia on the same day that two banks reported big profits. British Columbia is an influential province, accounting for 42 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons. Polls indicate the Liberals face a fight there from the opposition New Democrats, who also appeal to center-left voters. The Canadian Bankers Association criticized the news, saying that ""singling out specific economic sectors for special taxation is a proven detriment to economic growth"". The Canadian banks index (.GSPTXBA) slipped just 0.6% after the announcement, compared with little change in the Toronto stock benchmark (.GSPTSE), but still ended the day up 0.5% from Tuesday's close. Maria Khoury, senior vice president for North American financial institutions' credit ratings at DBRS Morningstar, said the muted reaction in part reflected skepticism over campaign promises and the broad expectation that some tax increases were inevitable following the flood of government support. Large banks include Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (RY.TO), Toronto Dominion Bank (TD.TO), Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) (BNS.TO), Bank of Montreal (BMO) (BMO.TO) and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. RBC beat analysts' expectations for third-quarter profit on Wednesday after Scotiabank and BMO did the same on Tuesday. read more Large insurers include Manulife Financial (MFC.TO), Sun Life Financial (SLF.TO), Intact Financial (IFC.TO) and Great-West Lifeco.

REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD Aug 24 (Reuters) - Canada's e-commerce giant Shopify Inc (SHOP.TO) said on Tuesday it was partnering with TikTok to work on a feature that would let shoppers buy directly from the social media app. Shopify merchants who have a TikTok business account would soon be able to add a shopping tab to their profiles for the first time ever, the company said in a blog post. The pilot version is currently available to users in the U.S. and UK and the company will launch in additional regions in the coming months. Social media giants including Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Twitter (TWTR.N) have recently been investing heavily in shopping features to drive sales growth. The companies are vying for a piece of the so-called social commerce industry, which relies on users' ability to discover and buy products through social media apps and is expected to balloon to $50 billion from $36 billion in annual sales by 2023 in the United States according to research firm eMarketer. read more Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/David Ryder WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday extended the closure of its land borders with Canada and Mexico to non-essential travel such as tourism through Sept. 21 despite Ottawa's decision to open its border to vaccinated Americans. The latest 30-day extension by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), came after Canada said in July it would start allowing in fully vaccinated U.S. visitors starting Aug. 9 for non-essential travel after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a lengthy ban that many businesses have called crippling. read more ""In coordination with public health and medical experts, DHS continues working closely with its partners across the United States and internationally to determine how to safely and sustainably resume normal travel,"" DHS said on Twitter. The United States has continued to extend the extraordinary restrictions on Canada and Mexico on a monthly basis since March 2020, when they were imposed to address the spread of COVID-19. Reuters reported this week the extension was expected. The latest restrictions extend the prohibitions beyond the end of the busy U.S. summer tourism season. Airline officials say it will be at least weeks and potentially months before any U.S. travel restrictions are lifted, citing the rising number of COVID-19 cases. The U.S. land border restrictions do not bar U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents from returning to the United States. Separate from the Canada and Mexico land border restrictions, the United States bars most non-U.S. citizens who within the last 14 days have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen countries in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil. The White House confirmed on Aug. 5 it may require visitors from abroad to be vaccinated as part of its plans to eventually reopen international travel but it had yet to decide and would not immediately lift restrictions. The White House in June launched interagency working groups with the European Union, Britain, Canada and Mexico to look at how eventually to lift travel and border restrictions.

HYBRIT, owned by SSAB (SSABa.ST), state-owned utility Vattenfall (VATN.UL) and miner LKAB, said it would deliver the steel to truck-maker Volvo AB (VOLVb.ST) as a trial run before full commercial production in 2026. ""I'm happy to be minister for enterprise and energy in a country where industry is bubbling with energy for a (green) reset,"" Ibrahim Baylan, Minister for Business, Industry and Innovation, told a press conference on Wednesday.

Chengdu Economic Daily REUTERS/Stringer It aims to replace coking coal, traditionally needed for ore-based steel making, with fossil-free electricity and hydrogen. Hydrogen is a key part of the EU's plan to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. SSAB, which accounts for 10% of Sweden's and 7% of Finland's carbon dioxide emissions, said the trial delivery was an ""important step towards a completely fossil-free value chain"". ""The goal is to deliver fossil-free steel to the market and demonstrate the technology on an industrial scale as early as 2026,"" it said in a statement. Another green steel venture, H2 Green Steel, is planning to build a fossil fuel-free steel plant in the north of Sweden, including a sustainable hydrogen facility, with production starting in 2024.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio MONTREAL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finds himself behind in polls ahead of a snap election he called hoping his management of the COVID-19 crisis would propel him to victory. Trudeau called the Sept. 20 election last month, two years ahead of schedule. At the time, his Liberals were well ahead and looked likely to regain the majority in parliament they lost in 2019. His main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, has repeatedly attacked him for calling a vote during the pandemic. The latest polls by Nanos, Ekos and others show Liberal fortunes have faded as voters have grown fatigued with Trudeau, 49, who has been in power since 2015. One Liberal strategist said on Friday the early-vote call had backfired as it was seen as ""wrong"" and ""greedy"" by electors. Also on Friday, Canadian health officials released modeling showing new COVID-19 cases could surpass the peak of the third wave within the month, and warned that if vaccinations among young adults do not ramp up, the country's hospital capacity may be exceeded. read more The Nanos Research survey for CTV put the Conservatives on 35.7% public support, with the Liberals on 30.7% and the smaller left-leaning New Democrats on 18.3%. An Ekos poll published late Thursday puts the Conservatives at 35.5% versus 30.7% for the Liberals.(See more polls: ) If these numbers hold up on election day, O'Toole would most likely win a minority administration. (See profiles of party leaders: read more ) On Thursday, the Conservative leader came out of a French-language leaders' debate without suffering much damage. During the exchanges, Trudeau said that if there were to be another minority government, there would most likely be another election in 18 months. read more ""We should not be in a campaign. Only Mr. Trudeau wanted this campaign for his own personal interests,"" O'Toole told reporters on Friday. ""And last night, he threatened another election if he doesn't get his way with this one. Canadians deserve better than that,"" he said after a campaign announcement in Montreal. On Friday, Trudeau said his debate comments referred to the average duration of minority governments. He then attacked O'Toole's opposition to vaccine mandates for domestic travel, saying the Conservative policy would put people in danger. ""Without strong leadership on vaccines, our kids won't be safe in the classroom, our businesses won't grow and thrive, and all Canadians will be at risk,"" Trudeau said. On Friday, Canadian health officials said there is an ""urgent need"" to ramp up vaccinations for 18- to 39-year-olds, who lag the rest of the population. They also said masking and social distancing must continue into the winter to prevent further spread. Some 77% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated. Liberal strategists expressed hope their fortunes will improve if Canadians start paying more attention next week after Monday's Labor Day holiday and two more debates. During the last two election campaigns, Trudeau won crucial support late by telling Canadians a vote for the New Democrats - who compete for the same left-leaning segment of the electorate - would split progressives resulting in a Conservative government.

REUTERS/John Morris Read More OTTAWA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Canadians will face a stark choice on how to tackle a childcare crisis when they go to the polls on Sept. 20, with the ruling Liberals vowing to push ahead with a subsidized daycare system and the rival Conservatives offering tax credits to parents. The dire need for affordable, reliable childcare in Canada was laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic, as daycare and school closures forced many parents, mostly women, to cut back work hours or leave jobs to care for children, hurting productivity. More than 48% of Canadian parents have struggled to find affordable childcare, a recent Statistics Canada study found, prompting 27% of them to delay a return to work and 41% to change work schedules. Public support for a national childcare program is high, with more than 70% of Canadians in favor, according to an Angus Reid poll. Support is strongest among women and left-leaning Canadians, key voting blocs for the center-left Liberals who are in a neck-and-neck race with the Conservatives. ""What the pandemic served to do was it really just made the challenges of trying to balance childcare with paid work so glaring,"" said Morna Ballantyne, executive director of Child Care Now, which advocates for publicly funded childcare. ""Women were dropping out of the paid labor force."" Mothers of young children saw a huge jump in unemployment during the pandemic, and continue to lag their male counterparts in recovering those losses. The labor participation rates for women with children are also far lower than for male parents. Getting those women working is key to Canada's economic growth, economists say. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals say their C$30 billion ($23.8 billion) plan to vastly lower daycare fees by ensuring an average cost of C$10-a-day and creating 250,000 new childcare spots over five years will help do that. The Liberal plan is being implemented in seven of the 10 provinces and one of the three Canadian territories. The Conservatives, out of power since losing a 2015 election, have said that if they win this month's vote, they will cancel those deals and instead offer payments of up to C$6,000 a year, based on income, to help parents pay for their daycare of choice. The two main parties' divergent approaches could make childcare a deciding factor in key electoral ridings, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, where center-based daycare spots are notoriously hard to find and childcare can cost families thousands of dollars each month. Kerry Liu, a Toronto-area father whose youngest child will be starting kindergarten this year, said daycare was a huge expense for his family and the Liberals' plan is definitely a key consideration for him in the election. ""For two kids it's almost C$3,000 (a month). So I believe C$10-a-day will benefit a lot of parents,"" he said. ""That's going to be a big game-changer."" The median cost for toddler care for one child in Toronto is C$1,578 a month. That drops to C$210 a month under the Liberal plan compared with C$1,178 a month for a middle-income family under the Conservative plan, according to Reuters' calculations. Reuters Graphics ""We're going to help all parents, all parents, immediately"" whether they use public daycare or not, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said when he launched his election platform last month. POSSIBLE WEDGE ISSUE Business groups, which typically are concerned about excessive government spending, prefer the tax-credit approach because subsidized care is more costly. But Trudeau's national daycare strategy is ""popular across the board"" with voters, said Nik Nanos, head of Nanos Research, and could be a wedge issue in tight races, particularly in urban centers where both parents typically work. ""If you're in downtown Toronto or downtown Vancouver, you want to run against the Conservatives on vaccinations and childcare,"" Nanos said, referring to the two main parties' divergence over mandated COVID-19 vaccinations. Trudeau, who hopes high COVID-19 vaccination rates and a strong economic rebound will help him win a majority government on Sept. 20, has mandated the shots for federal workers and all his candidates. O'Toole opposes the mandates. But the chaotic situation last month in Afghanistan, where Canada struggled to evacuate its citizens, has left Trudeau's Liberals sagging in the polls and well below the 170 seats needed for a majority in the House of Commons. Canada's economy also performed worse than expected in the second quarter. The Liberals, who currently rely on the support of opposition parties to pass legislation, are favored by 31% of voters versus 34% for the Conservatives, according to a new Nanos Research poll. The left-leaning New Democrats, who also support national daycare, are at 20%. Many childcare advocates back the Liberal plan. They say Canada needs more daycare spots, lower fees for parents and more job security for childcare workers. ""A tax credit to parents ... is not going to address any of those issues,"" said Kerry McCuaig, a fellow in early childhood policy at the University of Toronto's Atkinson Centre.

Picture taken April 14, 2021. REUTERS/Chris Helgren Read More OTTAWA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Canada's Conservatives hammered Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday after data showed that the country's economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter and again in July, putting the economy at the center of debate three weeks ahead of a national election. Canada is the only Group of Seven country to record a deceleration in the second quarter, according to an OECD report. ""Canada's economy is getting worse, not better,"" Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said from his Ottawa headquarters. ""Under Justin Trudeau we are heading further down the road of recession, not the road to recovery."" Canada's economy shrank 1.1% in the second quarter on an annualized basis, missing analyst expectations of a gain of 2.5%, Statistics Canada data showed. A preliminary estimate for July showed a contraction of 0.4%, while June GDP rose 0.7%, in line with expectations. With the July decline, economic activity remains about 2% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. ""It's a jaw-dropper,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, adding: ""It will probably be an uncomfortable question for the government today but I don't think the GDP number will have a huge impact on the elections."" Trudeau's Liberals are currently tied with the Conservatives at 33% ahead of the Sept 20 federal election, according a new Nanos Research poll. The left-leaning New Democrats have 19%. Polls have shown that the economy is one of the top concerns of Canadians heading into the vote. Statscan said the second-quarter drop was mostly driven by declines in home sales and exports. Housing investment boomed during the pandemic, helping drive the economic rebound from the crisis, but the market has cooled from its March peak. The likely contraction in July, which comes even as most provinces loosened COVID-19 restrictions, was driven by decreases in manufacturing, construction and retail trade, said Statscan. The outlook has been further clouded by a surge in new COVID-19 infections, mostly among the unvaccinated. Economists said the GDP miss could impact the timing of Bank of Canada policy tightening, though hot inflation and a strong August could also sway the picture. The central bank last month said it expected Canada's economy to gain 2.0% in the second quarter, with growth picking up ""strongly"" in the third quarter as more services reopened. It will put out new forecasts in October. ""It comes in weaker than their expectations,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group.

Under the preliminary proposal outlined in a company blog post, the fund would provide gig workers with cash benefits to put toward a retirement or life insurance plan, or to pay for educational or dental and health benefits not covered by Canada's universal healthcare system. The benefits fund would be enabled by Canada's provincial governments, Uber said in the blog post without providing further details, but managed by ride-hail and delivery companies. The companies would share data on drivers' hours and earnings and pay into the fund proportionally. Workers would qualify for fund benefits if they meet a threshold, which Uber's Monday proposal did not disclose. Uber in a statement said it welcomed discussions with other industry players, adding the benefits fund was part of a recent Ontario government submission. DoorDash Inc (DASH.N) in a statement said it welcomed other stakeholders who wanted to provide workers with benefits while maintaining their flexibility, but did not directly comment on Uber's plan. Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) and Just Eat Takeaway.com's (TKWY.AS) Grubhub did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Uber said it advocates for benefits funds everywhere, but added that labor laws, social safety nets and different cultures meant it would pursue a different approach in every country, with Monday's proposal tailored to Canada. Gig companies have long been criticized for the lack of benefits and protections they offer their independent contractor workers. Many labor unions, some lawmakers and the Biden administration have said gig workers should be reclassified as employees. read more The companies have also faced several lawsuits in Canada and the United States alleging worker misclassification. The companies have rejected calls for reclassification, saying surveys showed the majority of their workers do not want to be employees. In recent years, the companies have suggested limited benefit models while maintaining workers' contractor status, including in California where voters approved such a proposal last year. The companies at times have argued apportioning benefits is complicated by the fact that many drivers work for multiple platforms at once. In a March blog post outlining its initial Canadian proposal, Uber advocated for industry-wide reforms that held every company to the same standards.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio Read More OTTAWA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Canada's ruling Liberals on Friday said that if re-elected they would provide C$1 billion ($792 million) to help the 10 provinces create special passports for people to prove they had been inoculated against COVID-19. Polls show the Liberals, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, are narrowly ahead of their Conservative rivals. The election is on Sept 20. ""Proof of vaccination systems ensure Canadians can be confident that those around them are fully vaccinated, in addition to providing businesses with important and clear guidance around how to reopen safely,"" the Liberals said in a statement. The question of vaccines could be a wedge issue in the election. The Conservatives, led by Erin O'Toole, are not requiring inoculations for their candidates and suggest that rapid testing is an alternative to vaccine passports. The C$1 billion would help cover costs incurred by the provinces for creating vaccine passports for people wishing to enter nonessential businesses or public spaces. Some provinces have already said they plan to set up such a system. Earlier this month, the Liberal government said it would soon require all federal public servants and many other workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The mandate will also include air, train and cruise ship travelers. ""We are ensuring anyone traveling on a plane or a train must be vaccinated, but Erin O'Toole won't listen to the experts on this issue,"" Trudeau said in a statement.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren Read More OTTAWA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Canada's ruling Liberal Party said on Wednesday that if re-elected it would raise corporate taxes on the most profitable banks and insurers to help pay for the cost of the COVID-19 recovery. The Liberals said they would hike the rate to 18% from 15% on all earnings over C$1 billion ($793 million) and vowed to establish a special dividend, so that those same institutions contribute more. The measures are expected to generate C$2.5 billion per year over four years, starting in 2022/23. Polls show the Liberals, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, have a slender lead over their Conservative rivals ahead of the Sept. 20 election. ""Given that our banks have posted extraordinarily large profits, have continued to be incredibly successful, including through a pandemic ... we're going to ask them to do a little bit more,"" Trudeau told a campaign event in British Columbia on the same day that two banks reported big profits. British Columbia is an influential province, accounting for 42 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons. Polls indicate the Liberals face a fight there from the opposition New Democrats, who also appeal to center-left voters. The Canadian Bankers Association criticized the news, saying that ""singling out specific economic sectors for special taxation is a proven detriment to economic growth"". The Canadian banks index (.GSPTXBA) slipped just 0.6% after the announcement, compared with little change in the Toronto stock benchmark (.GSPTSE), but still ended the day up 0.5% from Tuesday's close. Maria Khoury, senior vice president for North American financial institutions' credit ratings at DBRS Morningstar, said the muted reaction in part reflected skepticism over campaign promises and the broad expectation that some tax increases were inevitable following the flood of government support. Large banks include Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (RY.TO), Toronto Dominion Bank (TD.TO), Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) (BNS.TO), Bank of Montreal (BMO) (BMO.TO) and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. RBC beat analysts' expectations for third-quarter profit on Wednesday after Scotiabank and BMO did the same on Tuesday. read more Large insurers include Manulife Financial (MFC.TO), Sun Life Financial (SLF.TO), Intact Financial (IFC.TO) and Great-West Lifeco.

REUTERS/Lars Hagberg Read More OTTAWA, Sept 9 (Reuters) - With less than two weeks before Canadians vote in a federal election, the race is too close to call. But what is certain is that for the first time in recent memory, no matter which party wins, the government spending taps will be wide open. The ruling Liberals and the rival Conservatives are both promising tens of billions of dollars in investments if they triumph in the Sept. 20 vote. Canada's two main parties say the spending is needed to battle the effects of a fourth wave of COVID-19 and kick-start an economic recovery. Economists, however, warn that the debt and budget deficits that will accompany the higher spending could leave Canadians with a hangover that lasts decades when interest rates climb from the current ultra-low levels. ""Voters should be aware of the fact that deficits do matter. They will cost money,"" said Craig Alexander, chief economist at Deloitte Canada. ""The debt service costs for these deficits and the accumulated debt is going to take up fiscal capacity down the road,"" said Alexander, who supports targeted spending. Canada's Conservatives, who tend to be more parsimonious than the other parties, revealed late on Wednesday that their campaign promises would cost more than C$51 billion ($40 billion) over five years without a hint of a balanced federal budget in that timeline. The center-left Liberals, meanwhile, have proposed C$78 billion in new spending. The Conservatives say they would reduce the deficit by about C$7 billion more than the Liberals by 2026, mainly thanks to their plans to eliminate the national daycare program. The spending that Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau embraced to stem the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is projected to push Canada's net debt to a record C$1.38 trillion by 2025. The Conservatives did not provide numbers for how their spending plan would impact the national debt. Reuters Graphics A near-debt crisis in the early 1990s, fueled in part by massive government spending in the 1970s and 1980s, shifted Canada's political landscape in favor of balanced budgets and prudent fiscal policy over big spending. But Canadians regarded the pandemic-related spending, and with it massive deficits, as justified, said pollster Nick Nanos, head of Nanos Research. Any talk of balanced budgets has become more an afterthought, at least for many voters. The worry is that S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service, two of the main ratings agencies, could follow Fitch Ratings' decision last year to cut Canada's triple-A credit rating if deficits become more structural in nature rather than cyclical. That would likely increase debt servicing costs, which could lead to higher taxes or government spending cuts. REIN IT IN Before the pandemic, Trudeau had relaxed his focus on the deficit and targeted a lowering of the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 30%. Liberals say that ratio, now above 50%, will still slowly come down despite Trudeau promising billions more on top of the C$101.4 billion stimulus budgeted in April. The Liberals, who currently have a minority government that relies on the opposition to pass legislation, trail the Conservatives 30.6% to 32.6% in the latest Nanos poll, with 20.3% for the left-leaning New Democrats, who also favor more government spending. The economy, which performed worse than expected in the second quarter, is a top concern for all voters, polls show, though deficits are more of a worry for those who normally cast a ballot for the Conservatives. Nanos said Canadians ""just don't like excessively large deficits, and they get a little uncomfortable when they see deficits as being part of the regular operation default of a government."" Conservative leader Erin O'Toole has walked a tightrope, vaguely promising to balance the budget within the next decade without major cuts, while pledging new spending. Reuters Graphics On Wednesday, the Conservatives said they would do better than the Liberals in lowering deficits over the next five years, in part by eliminating Trudeau's expensive national childcare program. read more Economists say stimulus should be focused on initiatives that boost competitiveness, like digital infrastructure, along with social spending that increases labor force participation, like funding childcare. ""I think the narrative around building back better needs to be rooted in how are we going to make the Canadian economy more competitive and more dynamic, and give it an edge over its international peers,"" Alexander said.

Trudeau has struggled to explain why an early election during a worsening fourth wave of COVID-19 was a good idea. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole consistently accuses the Liberal leader of putting Canadians in harm's way for personal ambition. People also seem to be tiring of Trudeau, who carries the baggage of having governed for six years. Since Trudeau called the election, his hefty opinion poll lead has vanished: surveys point to a tight race in which he could lose to the opposition Conservatives. Polls: But steady Conservative gains during the first three weeks seemed to have stopped as Trudeau attacked O'Toole for his opposition to vaccine mandates and his promise - now reversed - to legalize some assault weapons the Liberals had banned. WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES? To tackle the pandemic the Liberals ran up a record national debt of C$1 trillion ($785.7 billion) and pushed budget deficits to highs not seen since World War Two. In the campaign they promised another C$78 billion in new spending over five years. read more O'Toole says he will balance the books within a decade without making cuts. Analysts say financial markets do not appear overly worried about the fiscal implications of either promise although the stocks of bank and insurance firm could suffer after Trudeau promised a new windfall tax on their profits. VACCINE MANDATES The Liberal government has introduced COVID-19 vaccine mandates. During the campaign, Trudeau has been abused and heckled by people opposing the move and says his Conservative rival is taking his cues from the crowds. O'Toole opposes vaccine mandates, including for his own candidates, and says he prefers frequent testing. read more CHILDCARE Employment of women has plummeted thanks to COVID-19. The Liberals are promising to spend up to C$30 billion over five years to set up a long-promised C$10 a day national childcare program. The Conservatives say they will cancel those deals and instead offer tax credits of up to C$6,000 a year to help pay for daycare. read more HOUSING AFFORDABILITY Housing prices have soared about 70% since Trudeau took office. He is promising to build, preserve, or repair 1.4 million homes over the next four years, among other measures. The Conservatives would boost supply by building a million homes over three years and loosening some mortgage requirements. CLIMATE CHANGE Forest fires in western Canada and a drought in crop-growing areas are focusing attention on climate change. The Liberals promise more aggressive emissions cuts than the Conservatives, who are major advocates of the oil and gas industry. read more ($1 = 1.2665 Canadian dollars) Reporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Mark Heinrich Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier Read More WINNIPEG, Manitoba/MONTREAL, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Canada's federal election race is so close that even a few swing districts on the western Prairies, a region usually hostile to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals, may be key to his hopes to stay in power, analysts say. Trudeau, 49, called an election for Sept. 20 two years early, gambling that the country's successful COVID-19 vaccination campaign would help him hold the 155 seats he currently holds and pick up 15 more, which would allow him to govern without opposition support in the 338-seat House of Commons. But he appears destined to come up short, according to polls, and a minority government for either the Liberals or Erin O'Toole's Conservatives is most likely, said Darrell Bricker, CEO of pollster Ipsos Public Affairs. ""They've not been able to shake that initial disappointment for Canadians (with) the way the election was called and why it was called,"" Bricker said of the Liberals, noting that Canada is entering a fourth pandemic wave. ""It's really stuck to the Prime Minister personally."" A Nanos Research survey of 1,200 people for CTV on Monday put the Liberals at 34.1% popular support and the Conservatives at 32%, a reversal from a day earlier, when Liberals were at 33.4% compared with 34.9% for Conservatives. With the race nearly a dead heat, potential swing parliamentary constituencies have emerged across the country. The Liberals are fighting 20 ""toss-up"" races and the Conservatives 19, according to 338Canada.com, an election projection site. At least two Conservative seats in Calgary, heart of the country's oil industry, are in play for the Liberals, said Lori Williams, associate professor of political science at Mount Royal University in Calgary. One Conservative constituency in Edmonton is also up for grabs, according to 338Canada.com. ""These Alberta seats become pretty important, because (the election) could come down to a handful,"" Williams said. Alberta shut out the Liberals in 2019 amid fears that their climate change policies would undermine the oil industry. But those fears have abated due to Trudeau's support for the sector, Williams said. THE 905 The Conservatives' best opportunity to win lies in the commuter communities around Toronto, referred to by their telephone area code, 905, Bricker said. The Liberals dominated the 905 in 2019, but are on track only to split its roughly 75 seats with the Conservatives, raising doubts about the Liberals' retaining power, he said. Costas Menegakis, executive of a logistics company and the Conservative candidate for Richmond Hill, said fears of rising taxes and mortgage rates are driving support to his party. ""I think the Prime Minister miscalculated his potential fortunes"" in calling the election, he said. The left-of-center New Democratic Party (NDP) is challenging for Liberal seats in Toronto itself, leaving the ruling party under siege on both political flanks, Bricker said. To offset possible losses, Liberals are eyeing breakthroughs in Quebec and the West. In Quebec, nine constituencies, mostly held by the Bloc Quebecois - a Quebec separatist party - could fall to the Liberals, said Philippe Fournier, creator of 338Canada.com. The predominantly French-speaking province accounts for almost a quarter of the seats in the House. The Liberals are trying to flip constituencies like Trois-Rivières, where a once-fierce push to separate Quebec from Canada has taken a backseat to issues like climate change, infrastructure and labor shortages. When former newspaper opinion writer Martin Francoeur launched his Liberal candidacy for Trois Rivières, a constituency last held by the party in 1984, he was flanked by two cabinet ministers. Trudeau and party leaders from the Bloc and Conservatives have also visited to court voters. ""The Liberal party has a lot of hope for Trois-Rivières,"" Francoeur said. The Conservatives are eyeing to flip one Quebec electoral district from the Bloc, Beauport—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île d'Orléans—Charlevoix, in Quebec, along with four Maritime districts, a Tory strategist said. But the Liberals like their chances in three British Columbia constituencies they do not currently hold, a party source said. The Pacific province, however, as usual, is a wild card where four parties can be competitive, including the NDP and Greens.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio MONTREAL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finds himself behind in polls ahead of a snap election he called hoping his management of the COVID-19 crisis would propel him to victory. Trudeau called the Sept. 20 election last month, two years ahead of schedule. At the time, his Liberals were well ahead and looked likely to regain the majority in parliament they lost in 2019. His main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole, has repeatedly attacked him for calling a vote during the pandemic. The latest polls by Nanos, Ekos and others show Liberal fortunes have faded as voters have grown fatigued with Trudeau, 49, who has been in power since 2015. One Liberal strategist said on Friday the early-vote call had backfired as it was seen as ""wrong"" and ""greedy"" by electors. Also on Friday, Canadian health officials released modeling showing new COVID-19 cases could surpass the peak of the third wave within the month, and warned that if vaccinations among young adults do not ramp up, the country's hospital capacity may be exceeded. read more The Nanos Research survey for CTV put the Conservatives on 35.7% public support, with the Liberals on 30.7% and the smaller left-leaning New Democrats on 18.3%. An Ekos poll published late Thursday puts the Conservatives at 35.5% versus 30.7% for the Liberals.(See more polls: ) If these numbers hold up on election day, O'Toole would most likely win a minority administration. (See profiles of party leaders: read more ) On Thursday, the Conservative leader came out of a French-language leaders' debate without suffering much damage. During the exchanges, Trudeau said that if there were to be another minority government, there would most likely be another election in 18 months. read more ""We should not be in a campaign. Only Mr. Trudeau wanted this campaign for his own personal interests,"" O'Toole told reporters on Friday. ""And last night, he threatened another election if he doesn't get his way with this one. Canadians deserve better than that,"" he said after a campaign announcement in Montreal. On Friday, Trudeau said his debate comments referred to the average duration of minority governments. He then attacked O'Toole's opposition to vaccine mandates for domestic travel, saying the Conservative policy would put people in danger. ""Without strong leadership on vaccines, our kids won't be safe in the classroom, our businesses won't grow and thrive, and all Canadians will be at risk,"" Trudeau said. On Friday, Canadian health officials said there is an ""urgent need"" to ramp up vaccinations for 18- to 39-year-olds, who lag the rest of the population. They also said masking and social distancing must continue into the winter to prevent further spread. Some 77% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated. Liberal strategists expressed hope their fortunes will improve if Canadians start paying more attention next week after Monday's Labor Day holiday and two more debates. During the last two election campaigns, Trudeau won crucial support late by telling Canadians a vote for the New Democrats - who compete for the same left-leaning segment of the electorate - would split progressives resulting in a Conservative government.

729542,20210910,reuters.com,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fate-national-daycare-hands-canadian-voters-2021-09-02/,text/html,text/html,en,"Fate of national daycare in the hands of Canadian voters | Reuters Skip to main content World Business Legal Markets More Sign In Register Menu September 2, 202110:09 AM UTCLast Updated ago Americas Fate of national daycare in the hands of Canadian voters By Julie Gordon 5 minute read 1/2 Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau plays with children at the daycare in Carrefour de l'Isle-Saint-Jean school in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, July 27, 2021. REUTERS/John Morris Read More OTTAWA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Canadians will face a stark choice on how to tackle a childcare crisis when they go to the polls on Sept. 20, with the ruling Liberals vowing to push ahead with a subsidized daycare system and the rival Conservatives offering tax credits to parents. The dire need for affordable, reliable childcare in Canada was laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic, as daycare and school closures forced many parents, mostly women, to cut back work hours or leave jobs to care for children, hurting productivity. More than 48% of Canadian parents have struggled to find affordable childcare, a recent Statistics Canada study found, prompting 27% of them to delay a return to work and 41% to change work schedules. Public support for a national childcare program is high, with more than 70% of Canadians in favor, according to an Angus Reid poll. Support is strongest among women and left-leaning Canadians, key voting blocs for the center-left Liberals who are in a neck-and-neck race with the Conservatives. ""What the pandemic served to do was it really just made the challenges of trying to balance childcare with paid work so glaring,"" said Morna Ballantyne, executive director of Child Care Now, which advocates for publicly funded childcare. ""Women were dropping out of the paid labor force."" Mothers of young children saw a huge jump in unemployment during the pandemic, and continue to lag their male counterparts in recovering those losses. The labor participation rates for women with children are also far lower than for male parents. Getting those women working is key to Canada's economic growth, economists say. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals say their C$30 billion ($23.8 billion) plan to vastly lower daycare fees by ensuring an average cost of C$10-a-day and creating 250,000 new childcare spots over five years will help do that. The Liberal plan is being implemented in seven of the 10 provinces and one of the three Canadian territories. The Conservatives, out of power since losing a 2015 election, have said that if they win this month's vote, they will cancel those deals and instead offer payments of up to C$6,000 a year, based on income, to help parents pay for their daycare of choice. The two main parties' divergent approaches could make childcare a deciding factor in key electoral ridings, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, where center-based daycare spots are notoriously hard to find and childcare can cost families thousands of dollars each month. Kerry Liu, a Toronto-area father whose youngest child will be starting kindergarten this year, said daycare was a huge expense for his family and the Liberals' plan is definitely a key consideration for him in the election. ""For two kids it's almost C$3,000 (a month). So I believe C$10-a-day will benefit a lot of parents,"" he said. ""That's going to be a big game-changer."" The median cost for toddler care for one child in Toronto is C$1,578 a month. That drops to C$210 a month under the Liberal plan compared with C$1,178 a month for a middle-income family under the Conservative plan, according to Reuters' calculations. Reuters Graphics ""We're going to help all parents, all parents, immediately"" whether they use public daycare or not, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said when he launched his election platform last month. POSSIBLE WEDGE ISSUE Business groups, which typically are concerned about excessive government spending, prefer the tax-credit approach because subsidized care is more costly. But Trudeau's national daycare strategy is ""popular across the board"" with voters, said Nik Nanos, head of Nanos Research, and could be a wedge issue in tight races, particularly in urban centers where both parents typically work. ""If you're in downtown Toronto or downtown Vancouver, you want to run against the Conservatives on vaccinations and childcare,"" Nanos said, referring to the two main parties' divergence over mandated COVID-19 vaccinations. Trudeau, who hopes high COVID-19 vaccination rates and a strong economic rebound will help him win a majority government on Sept. 20, has mandated the shots for federal workers and all his candidates. O'Toole opposes the mandates. But the chaotic situation last month in Afghanistan, where Canada struggled to evacuate its citizens, has left Trudeau's Liberals sagging in the polls and well below the 170 seats needed for a majority in the House of Commons. Canada's economy also performed worse than expected in the second quarter. The Liberals, who currently rely on the support of opposition parties to pass legislation, are favored by 31% of voters versus 34% for the Conservatives, according to a new Nanos Research poll. The left-leaning New Democrats, who also support national daycare, are at 20%. Many childcare advocates back the Liberal plan. They say Canada needs more daycare spots, lower fees for parents and more job security for childcare workers. ""A tax credit to parents ... is not going to address any of those issues,"" said Kerry McCuaig, a fellow in early childhood policy at the University of Toronto's Atkinson Centre.

Picture taken April 14, 2021. REUTERS/Chris Helgren Read More OTTAWA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Canada's Conservatives hammered Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday after data showed that the country's economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter and again in July, putting the economy at the center of debate three weeks ahead of a national election. Canada is the only Group of Seven country to record a deceleration in the second quarter, according to an OECD report. ""Canada's economy is getting worse, not better,"" Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said from his Ottawa headquarters. ""Under Justin Trudeau we are heading further down the road of recession, not the road to recovery."" Canada's economy shrank 1.1% in the second quarter on an annualized basis, missing analyst expectations of a gain of 2.5%, Statistics Canada data showed. A preliminary estimate for July showed a contraction of 0.4%, while June GDP rose 0.7%, in line with expectations. With the July decline, economic activity remains about 2% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. ""It's a jaw-dropper,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, adding: ""It will probably be an uncomfortable question for the government today but I don't think the GDP number will have a huge impact on the elections."" Trudeau's Liberals are currently tied with the Conservatives at 33% ahead of the Sept 20 federal election, according a new Nanos Research poll. The left-leaning New Democrats have 19%. Polls have shown that the economy is one of the top concerns of Canadians heading into the vote. Statscan said the second-quarter drop was mostly driven by declines in home sales and exports. Housing investment boomed during the pandemic, helping drive the economic rebound from the crisis, but the market has cooled from its March peak. The likely contraction in July, which comes even as most provinces loosened COVID-19 restrictions, was driven by decreases in manufacturing, construction and retail trade, said Statscan. The outlook has been further clouded by a surge in new COVID-19 infections, mostly among the unvaccinated. Economists said the GDP miss could impact the timing of Bank of Canada policy tightening, though hot inflation and a strong August could also sway the picture. The central bank last month said it expected Canada's economy to gain 2.0% in the second quarter, with growth picking up ""strongly"" in the third quarter as more services reopened. It will put out new forecasts in October. ""It comes in weaker than their expectations,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. ""At the same time, we also have to recognize that there will be a major rebound in the third quarter. So all hope is not lost."" The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% lower at 1.2620 to the greenback, or 79.24 U.S. cents.

Adrian Wyld/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Read More TORONTO, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Foreign investors are growing more worried that Canada's federal election on Monday could result in a deadlock that hampers Ottawa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and further slows the economic recovery from the crisis. Polls show Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's center-left Liberals virtually tied with the opposition Conservatives ahead of the Sept. 20 vote, raising the prospect that no party will be able to form even a stable minority government. Adding to the uncertainty is an expected increase in mail-in voting that could delay the counting of ballots in some key electoral ridings. read more Financial markets generally view Canadian elections from the vantage point of which of the big parties would be most friendly for investors, but that tendency may take a backseat this time to the desire to have a government quickly in place in a crisis. The results of Canadian elections typically are known within hours of the polls closing. Even when no party has won a majority of the seats, it is usually clear which will form the government and what the general policy priorities will be. An outcome ""that leads to a gridlocked government is going to complicate the recovery going forward, and I think that's why you are probably going to see some (investor) hesitancy ahead of the election,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. ""Right now, we're in the process of an economic recovery that needs everything to line up nicely."" Trudeau, who has been prime minister for six years, has relied on the backing of the New Democrats since failing to win a majority of the seats in the House of Commons in the 2019 election. Polls show the smaller left-leaning party poised to do better on Monday, with enough support perhaps to compel the Liberals to tilt to the left if they wish to remain in power. SPENDING SPREE Trudeau's government has spent billions of dollars to stem the fallout from the pandemic, while the Bank of Canada has cut interest rates and purchased bonds to stimulate the economy. Although the central bank has vowed to keep its key interest rate at a record low of 0.25% until economic slack is absorbed, troubling signs have appeared on the horizon. Canada's economic growth slowed in the second quarter and annual inflation spiked in August to an 18-year high, taking some of the wind out of the sails of the Liberal leader's economic argument for reelection. read more The Canadian dollar has fallen 1.1% to about 1.2650 per U.S. dollar, or 79.05 U.S. cents, since Trudeau called the election in mid-August, and speculators have turned bearish on the currency for the first time since last December. The market's measure of expected volatility for the currency over a one-week period , a timeframe that covers the election, has climbed to an annualized rate of about 7.5% from less than 5% in August. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index (.GSPTSE), the country's main stock index, fell 1.7% on Tuesday to its lowest closing level in nearly three weeks, while an index showing implied volatility for the Toronto stock market (.VIXI) hit its highest closing value since Aug. 23.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio OTTAWA, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Canadians voted in advanced polls in record numbers ahead of an upcoming election, some looking to beat crowds amid the coronavirus pandemic,according to data released this week, though an expected avalanche of mail-in ballots has failed to materialize. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called the snap Sept. 20 election to try to secure a majority, is now fighting to keep his job with his Liberal party in a tight race against their main rival, the Conservatives. Nearly 5.8 million Canadians voted early this election, up 18.5% from the 2019 vote, preliminary data from Elections Canada shows. Separately, a record 1.2 million mail-in ballots have also been issued, though that is far fewer than the 2.3 million to 4.3 million range Elections Canada had predicted. Canada has more than 27 million eligible voters. The surge at advanced polls, coupled with softer demand for mail-in ballots, shows Canada's highly vaccinated populace is comfortable voting in-person, alleviating some worries voters would not show up due to pandemic fears, said experts. ""Most people are double vaccinated now. So I think they are maybe less afraid to go vote in-person,"" said Daniel Beland, a professor of political science at McGill University. ""If we were still in the third wave, where few people had been vaccinated, I think things might be different."" More than 77% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated, but a Delta-driven fourth wave has cases surging across the country. While mail-in voting is proving less popular than anticipated, it could still slow counts in a handful of tight ridings, potentially delaying the overall outcome for days. Most mail ballots will be counted only after they are checked against in-person votes. ""This will be an unusual election because we will break the record for mail-in ballots federally. That plus the pandemic makes it difficult to get a sense of the likely voter turnout,"" said Nik Nanos, the head of Nanos Research. The Conservatives and Liberals are locked in a dead heat at 31.2% to 30.5% of the vote less than a week from election day, according to the latest Nanos poll. The left leaning New Democrats have 21.4%. Trudeau was attacked by his rivals on Wednesday, after data showed inflation was at an 18-year high amid upward pressure on prices for everything from gasoline to housing to furniture. read more (This story has been refiled to change headline) Reporting by Julie Gordon in Ottawa; Editing by Aurora Ellis Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Andrej Ivanov OTTAWA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The head of Canada's election oversight body said on Wednesday that the majority of mail-in ballots in the upcoming federal election will be counted after election day, delaying the final result. Mail-in voting is set to soar before the Sept. 20 election, with Elections Canada saying it now expects 2.3 million to 4.3 million such ballots, depending on the path of the pandemic. By comparison, just under 50,000 people voted by mail in the 2019 election, mostly from abroad. read more ""I know that Canadians are used to getting complete results on election night, but it will be different with this election,"" said Stephane Perrault, chief electoral officer for Elections Canada, the independent body running the vote. ""The count of mail-in ballots will start after election day,"" he told reporters. ""In most locations, this should be done within two days, but in some districts it could take as long as five days."" The agency expects to count up to 700,000 mail-in ballots in Ottawa, mostly from Canadians living abroad and from military members, with those results released on election night. The rest will be held at local electoral offices and checked against in-person votes to ensure no one votes twice. ""If somebody walks up on voting day and says: 'I did not receive my mail-in kit,' that person will swear an oath to that effect and will be allowed to vote in person. We will be able to check to make sure that that is true,"" said Perrault. The mail-in vote will be set aside if Elections Canada determines that individual also voted in person, said Perrault. In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, there was a surge in ballots being cast by mail amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the counting process delaying the final vote tallies and the determination of the outcome by several days. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau launched the election on Sunday, hoping a strong vaccine rollout and post-pandemic rebound would help him regain the majority he lost two years ago. Higher inflation took center stage on Wednesday. read more Trudeau's Liberals lead nationally with 34% of the vote to the Conservatives' 28%, with the New Democrats tracking at 22%, according to an Abacus Data poll released on Wednesday.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio Read More OTTAWA, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Canadians go to the polls on Sept. 20 in an election that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called two years early, seeking to turn public approval for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic into a fresh, four-year mandate. WHY NOW? Since 2019, Trudeau has only commanded a minority in parliament, leaving him dependent on other parties to govern. Trudeau argues the pandemic has changed Canada like World War Two did and Canadians should now choose who they want to make important decisions for decades to come. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? Trudeau has struggled to explain why an early election during a worsening fourth wave of COVID-19 was a good idea. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole consistently accuses the Liberal leader of putting Canadians in harm's way for personal ambition. People also seem to be tiring of Trudeau, who carries the baggage of having governed for six years. After Trudeau called the election, his hefty opinion poll lead vanished. Recent surveys point to a tight race in which he might retain power with another minority. Polls: Steady Conservative gains during the first three weeks stopped as Trudeau attacked O'Toole for his opposition to vaccine mandates and his promise - now reversed - to legalize some assault weapons the Liberals had banned. O'Toole stepped up his attacks on Trudeau on Monday, portraying him as a scandal-hit party-goer obsessed with keeping power at all costs. WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES? To tackle the pandemic the Liberals ran up a record national debt of C$1 trillion ($785.7 billion) and pushed budget deficits to highs not seen since World War Two. In the campaign they promised another C$78 billion in new spending over five years. read more O'Toole says he will balance the books within a decade without making cuts. Analysts say financial markets do not appear overly worried about the fiscal implications of either promise although the stocks of bank and insurance firm could suffer after Trudeau promised a new windfall tax on their profits. VACCINE MANDATES The Liberal government has introduced COVID-19 vaccine mandates. During the campaign, Trudeau has been abused and heckled by people opposing the move and says his Conservative rival is taking his cues from the crowds. O'Toole opposes vaccine mandates, including for his own candidates, and says he prefers frequent testing. read more CHILDCARE Employment of women has plummeted thanks to COVID-19. The Liberals are promising to spend up to C$30 billion over five years to set up a long-promised C$10 a day national childcare program. The Conservatives say they will cancel those deals and instead offer tax credits of up to C$6,000 a year to help pay for daycare. read more HOUSING AFFORDABILITY Housing prices have soared about 70% since Trudeau took office. He is promising to build, preserve, or repair 1.4 million homes over the next four years, among other measures. The Conservatives would boost supply by building a million homes over three years and loosening some mortgage requirements. CLIMATE CHANGE Forest fires in western Canada and a drought in crop-growing areas are focusing attention on climate change. The Liberals promise more aggressive emissions cuts than the Conservatives, who are major advocates of the oil and gas industry. read more ($1 = 1.2665 Canadian dollars) Reporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Mark Heinrich and Bernadette Baum Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Lars Hagberg Read More OTTAWA, Sept 9 (Reuters) - With less than two weeks before Canadians vote in a federal election, the race is too close to call. But what is certain is that for the first time in recent memory, no matter which party wins, the government spending taps will be wide open. The ruling Liberals and the rival Conservatives are both promising tens of billions of dollars in investments if they triumph in the Sept. 20 vote. Canada's two main parties say the spending is needed to battle the effects of a fourth wave of COVID-19 and kick-start an economic recovery. Economists, however, warn that the debt and budget deficits that will accompany the higher spending could leave Canadians with a hangover that lasts decades when interest rates climb from the current ultra-low levels. ""Voters should be aware of the fact that deficits do matter. They will cost money,"" said Craig Alexander, chief economist at Deloitte Canada. ""The debt service costs for these deficits and the accumulated debt is going to take up fiscal capacity down the road,"" said Alexander, who supports targeted spending. Canada's Conservatives, who tend to be more parsimonious than the other parties, revealed late on Wednesday that their campaign promises would cost more than C$51 billion ($40 billion) over five years without a hint of a balanced federal budget in that timeline. The center-left Liberals, meanwhile, have proposed C$78 billion in new spending. The Conservatives say they would reduce the deficit by about C$7 billion more than the Liberals by 2026, mainly thanks to their plans to eliminate the national daycare program. The spending that Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau embraced to stem the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is projected to push Canada's net debt to a record C$1.38 trillion by 2025. The Conservatives did not provide numbers for how their spending plan would impact the national debt. Reuters Graphics A near-debt crisis in the early 1990s, fueled in part by massive government spending in the 1970s and 1980s, shifted Canada's political landscape in favor of balanced budgets and prudent fiscal policy over big spending. But Canadians regarded the pandemic-related spending, and with it massive deficits, as justified, said pollster Nick Nanos, head of Nanos Research. Any talk of balanced budgets has become more an afterthought, at least for many voters. The worry is that S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service, two of the main ratings agencies, could follow Fitch Ratings' decision last year to cut Canada's triple-A credit rating if deficits become more structural in nature rather than cyclical. That would likely increase debt servicing costs, which could lead to higher taxes or government spending cuts. REIN IT IN Before the pandemic, Trudeau had relaxed his focus on the deficit and targeted a lowering of the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 30%. Liberals say that ratio, now above 50%, will still slowly come down despite Trudeau promising billions more on top of the C$101.4 billion stimulus budgeted in April. The Liberals, who currently have a minority government that relies on the opposition to pass legislation, trail the Conservatives 30.6% to 32.6% in the latest Nanos poll, with 20.3% for the left-leaning New Democrats, who also favor more government spending. The economy, which performed worse than expected in the second quarter, is a top concern for all voters, polls show, though deficits are more of a worry for those who normally cast a ballot for the Conservatives. Nanos said Canadians ""just don't like excessively large deficits, and they get a little uncomfortable when they see deficits as being part of the regular operation default of a government."" Conservative leader Erin O'Toole has walked a tightrope, vaguely promising to balance the budget within the next decade without major cuts, while pledging new spending. Reuters Graphics On Wednesday, the Conservatives said they would do better than the Liberals in lowering deficits over the next five years, in part by eliminating Trudeau's expensive national childcare program. read more Economists say stimulus should be focused on initiatives that boost competitiveness, like digital infrastructure, along with social spending that increases labor force participation, like funding childcare. ""I think the narrative around building back better needs to be rooted in how are we going to make the Canadian economy more competitive and more dynamic, and give it an edge over its international peers,"" Alexander said.

Adrian Wyld/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Read More TORONTO, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Foreign investors are growing more worried that Canada's federal election on Monday could result in a deadlock that hampers Ottawa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and further slows the economic recovery from the crisis. Polls show Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's center-left Liberals virtually tied with the opposition Conservatives ahead of the Sept. 20 vote, raising the prospect that no party will be able to form even a stable minority government. Adding to the uncertainty is an expected increase in mail-in voting that could delay the counting of ballots in some key electoral ridings. read more Financial markets generally view Canadian elections from the vantage point of which of the big parties would be most friendly for investors, but that tendency may take a backseat this time to the desire to have a government quickly in place in a crisis. The results of Canadian elections typically are known within hours of the polls closing. Even when no party has won a majority of the seats, it is usually clear which will form the government and what the general policy priorities will be. An outcome ""that leads to a gridlocked government is going to complicate the recovery going forward, and I think that's why you are probably going to see some (investor) hesitancy ahead of the election,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. ""Right now, we're in the process of an economic recovery that needs everything to line up nicely."" Trudeau, who has been prime minister for six years, has relied on the backing of the New Democrats since failing to win a majority of the seats in the House of Commons in the 2019 election. Polls show the smaller left-leaning party poised to do better on Monday, with enough support perhaps to compel the Liberals to tilt to the left if they wish to remain in power. SPENDING SPREE Trudeau's government has spent billions of dollars to stem the fallout from the pandemic, while the Bank of Canada has cut interest rates and purchased bonds to stimulate the economy. Although the central bank has vowed to keep its key interest rate at a record low of 0.25% until economic slack is absorbed, troubling signs have appeared on the horizon. Canada's economic growth slowed in the second quarter and annual inflation spiked in August to an 18-year high, taking some of the wind out of the sails of the Liberal leader's economic argument for reelection. read more The Canadian dollar has fallen 1.1% to about 1.2650 per U.S. dollar, or 79.05 U.S. cents, since Trudeau called the election in mid-August, and speculators have turned bearish on the currency for the first time since last December. The market's measure of expected volatility for the currency over a one-week period , a timeframe that covers the election, has climbed to an annualized rate of about 7.5% from less than 5% in August. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index (.GSPTSE), the country's main stock index, fell 1.7% on Tuesday to its lowest closing level in nearly three weeks, while an index showing implied volatility for the Toronto stock market (.VIXI) hit its highest closing value since Aug. 23. Equities investors are casting a nervous eye over some of the campaign promises made by the parties, including Trudeau's vow to raise corporate taxes on the most profitable banks and insurers to help pay for the cost of the recovery and his pledge to immediately cap oil and gas emissions. read more ""If it started to lean towards a Liberal majority I would begin to sell energy and banks,"" said Greg Taylor, a portfolio manager at Purpose Investments in Toronto. There is also nervousness over a promise by the Conservatives, the main opposition party, to increase foreign competition in the telecommunications sector as well as a pledge by the Liberals to curb excessive profits from rental housing, which could hurt real estate investment trusts.

REUTERS/Carlos Osorio OTTAWA, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Canadians voted in advanced polls in record numbers ahead of an upcoming election, some looking to beat crowds amid the coronavirus pandemic,according to data released this week, though an expected avalanche of mail-in ballots has failed to materialize. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called the snap Sept. 20 election to try to secure a majority, is now fighting to keep his job with his Liberal party in a tight race against their main rival, the Conservatives. Nearly 5.8 million Canadians voted early this election, up 18.5% from the 2019 vote, preliminary data from Elections Canada shows. Separately, a record 1.2 million mail-in ballots have also been issued, though that is far fewer than the 2.3 million to 4.3 million range Elections Canada had predicted. Canada has more than 27 million eligible voters. The surge at advanced polls, coupled with softer demand for mail-in ballots, shows Canada's highly vaccinated populace is comfortable voting in-person, alleviating some worries voters would not show up due to pandemic fears, said experts. ""Most people are double vaccinated now. So I think they are maybe less afraid to go vote in-person,"" said Daniel Beland, a professor of political science at McGill University. ""If we were still in the third wave, where few people had been vaccinated, I think things might be different."" More than 77% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated, but a Delta-driven fourth wave has cases surging across the country. While mail-in voting is proving less popular than anticipated, it could still slow counts in a handful of tight ridings, potentially delaying the overall outcome for days. Most mail ballots will be counted only after they are checked against in-person votes. ""This will be an unusual election because we will break the record for mail-in ballots federally. That plus the pandemic makes it difficult to get a sense of the likely voter turnout,"" said Nik Nanos, the head of Nanos Research. The Conservatives and Liberals are locked in a dead heat at 31.2% to 30.5% of the vote less than a week from election day, according to the latest Nanos poll. The left leaning New Democrats have 21.4%. Trudeau was attacked by his rivals on Wednesday, after data showed inflation was at an 18-year high amid upward pressure on prices for everything from gasoline to housing to furniture. read more (This story has been refiled to change headline) Reporting by Julie Gordon in Ottawa; Editing by Aurora Ellis Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Andrej Ivanov OTTAWA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The head of Canada's election oversight body said on Wednesday that the majority of mail-in ballots in the upcoming federal election will be counted after election day, delaying the final result. Mail-in voting is set to soar before the Sept. 20 election, with Elections Canada saying it now expects 2.3 million to 4.3 million such ballots, depending on the path of the pandemic. By comparison, just under 50,000 people voted by mail in the 2019 election, mostly from abroad. read more ""I know that Canadians are used to getting complete results on election night, but it will be different with this election,"" said Stephane Perrault, chief electoral officer for Elections Canada, the independent body running the vote. ""The count of mail-in ballots will start after election day,"" he told reporters. ""In most locations, this should be done within two days, but in some districts it could take as long as five days."" The agency expects to count up to 700,000 mail-in ballots in Ottawa, mostly from Canadians living abroad and from military members, with those results released on election night. The rest will be held at local electoral offices and checked against in-person votes to ensure no one votes twice. ""If somebody walks up on voting day and says: 'I did not receive my mail-in kit,' that person will swear an oath to that effect and will be allowed to vote in person. We will be able to check to make sure that that is true,"" said Perrault. The mail-in vote will be set aside if Elections Canada determines that individual also voted in person, said Perrault. In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, there was a surge in ballots being cast by mail amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the counting process delaying the final vote tallies and the determination of the outcome by several days. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau launched the election on Sunday, hoping a strong vaccine rollout and post-pandemic rebound would help him regain the majority he lost two years ago. Higher inflation took center stage on Wednesday. read more Trudeau's Liberals lead nationally with 34% of the vote to the Conservatives' 28%, with the New Democrats tracking at 22%, according to an Abacus Data poll released on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: A truck moves past stacked shipping containers at the Port of Montreal in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, May 17, 2021. REUTERS/Christinne Muschi The Canadian economy contracted 0.1% in July, just beating analyst estimates of a decline of 0.2%, but likely grew by 0.7% in August on jumps in services and manufacturing, Statistics Canada said. The August number is a preliminary estimate. With the expected rise in August, total economic activity is about 1% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. “The slightly smaller-than-expected setback in July and nice pop in August suggest that the economy managed to grind out some moderate growth in the summer quarter as a whole,” Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. The July decline came as a heat wave hit the agriculture sector and manufacturers were dragged down by supply chain woes, while construction declined for the third month in a row. This was partially offset by strong momentum in services, as the easing of public-health measures continued to drive a rebound in hospitality and tourism, Statscan said. That strength in services is expected to extend into August and beyond, even as a harsh fourth wave of COVID-19 infections weighs on the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Analysts said the Bank of Canada will likely go ahead with another tapering in its Oct. 27 rate decision, though the August gain is likely not enough to move the dial for the central bank on interest rates - especially after a disappointing second-quarter contraction here. “We think the likelihood of (the Bank of Canada) soon following other global central banks in taking a hawkish turn is low,” Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. The Canadian dollar was nearly unchanged at 1.2675 per greenback, or 78.90 U.S. cents.

REUTERS/Blair Gable Read More OTTAWA, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday he will swear in his new cabinet next month, with Chrystia Freeland returning as his finance minister and deputy, after his Liberals were re-elected for the third time. Trudeau, speaking with reporters in Ottawa at his first full news conference since the Sept. 20 election, also said lawmakers would be back in parliament this fall - without giving a date - and that putting previously announced vaccine mandates in place would be a priority. ""I have asked Chrystia Freeland to continue serving as deputy prime minister and our minister of finance, and she has accepted,"" he said. ""We will be swearing in cabinet in the month of October and we will be bringing back the House of Commons before the end of fall,"" he added. Trudeau's Liberals were returned to power in a closely contested election, but fell short of winning a majority. That means they will continue to need the support of at least one opposition party to pass legislation. Despite that challenge, Trudeau said he hoped his new government would last the full four years, and that he was ready to work in partnership with other parties on the major issues. One of the first will be a promise the Liberals made to require vaccination for federal workers and for most domestic air and train travelers. Canada continues to battle a Delta-driven fourth wave of coronavirus infections. ""Immediately we will deal with the mandate for federal employees who will have to get vaccinated, and there will be announcements about that in the coming days,"" Trudeau said, without saying whether workers who refuse will be fired. While Trudeau did not a give a date for swearing in his new cabinet, he said there would be gender parity. Three of his female cabinet ministers lost their seats in the election and one did not run. ""I will be seeking, as I always do, to ensure that there is a proper regional distribution, that there is a range of skills and diversity around the table,"" Trudeau said. The only certain return to the cabinet at this point is Freeland, Trudeau's deputy and closest minister, seen by many as his mostly likely successor. Canada's first female finance minister, Freeland, 53, is an advocate for women's employment and childcare. The Liberals won 159 seats in the election, short of the 170 needed for a majority but two more than in 2019, though one lawmakers elected as a Liberal will sit as an independent. The Conservatives took 119 seats and the New Democrats have 25, while the Quebec-focused Bloc Quebecois have 33. One recount has been requested so far.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren OTTAWA, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Annamie Paul announced her resignation as head of Canada's Green Party on Monday after losing in her own district in last week's parliamentary election, stepping aside just under a year after becoming the nation's first Black leader of a mainstream national party. Paul, 48, said she felt she was never truly allowed to lead the fractious environmentally focused party and was not interested in going through a fight to remain its chief. She called her time as party leader ""the worst period in my life."" ""When I was elected and put in this role, I was breaking a glass ceiling,"" Paul told reporters in Toronto. ""What I didn't realize at the time is that I was breaking a glass ceiling that was going to fall on my head."" Paul came in fourth in her own Toronto constituency - won by the Liberals - and the Greens dropped 4 percentage points nationally in the Sept. 20 election compared with 2019. They won only two seats in the 338-seat House of Commons compared with three two years ago. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a third term, albeit with a minority of seats in parliament. Paul, a Toronto lawyer, beat out seven other contenders to win the leadership of the party last October. But she has for months been in a battle with the party's federal council, which tried to oust her before the election. The party did not provide funding for Paul to hire a campaign staff or a national campaign manager. ""I just don't have the heart for it,"" Paul said, referring to going through a leadership review invoked by the party immediately after the election. Of the discord within the party, Paul said she had never been given the opportunity to lead and ""I will not be given that opportunity."" Jenica Atwin, one of the three Green parliamentarians, left the party in June and joined the Liberals. Atwin was elected as a Liberal last week. Atwin has said her exit was in large part due to a dispute over the party's stance on Israel. Paul is Jewish. Atwin on Twitter criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians. A senior adviser to Paul, Noah Zatzman, posted on Facebook that some unspecified Green members of parliament were anti-Semitic. The Greens had appeared to be well-positioned going into this year's election, as most Canadians indicated that fighting climate change was one of their priority issues. But Liberals and the left-leaning New Democrats promoted their own climate plans and capitalized on the sense of chaos within the party. Paul said during the campaign that she had thought several times about quitting, but wanted to stay and fight for important causes. Paul was the second person of color to head a federal party in Canada after Jagmeet Singh took over the left-leaning New Democrats in 2017.

Slideshow ( 3 images ) Analysts said the figures showed the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining pace but predicted the Bank of Canada would want to see sustained evidence of strength before adopting a more aggressive stance on the timing of interest rate hikes. Statistics Canada reported a net gain of 157,100 new jobs, all of them in full-time employment. The jobless rate dipped to 6.9%, the lowest level since February 2020. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the country would add 65,000 new jobs in September and its unemployment rate would fall to 6.9% from 7.1% in August. Canada has now returned to the employment levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic started last year, having regained the 3 million jobs it lost during the crisis, Statscan said. “It’s very solid and shows that Canada is doing well in that fourth wave,” said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group, saying the central bank might announce later in October that it is further tapering its quantitative easing program. All the job gains came in full-time employment, which posted an increase of 193,600 new jobs, and were split evenly between the public and private sectors. The economy shed 36,500 part-time positions. The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.25% last year and says it will not consider raising them again until the economy has absorbed excess slack, which it expects to occur in the second half of 2022. Due to population growth, there are still 276,000 more people unemployed than there were in February 2020. “The Bank of Canada is still going to want to see more improvement from here because their goal isn’t just to get back to the pre-pandemic jobs number, it (is) to get back to the pre-pandemic employment population ratio,” said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. The Canadian dollar touched its strongest level since Aug. 11 at 1.2490 per greenback, or 80.06 U.S. cents, up as much as 0.5% on the day. Separately, data showed U.S. employment increased far less than expected in September. Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, noted that while the number of hours worked were up 1.1%, they remained 1.5% below their pre-pandemic level. “While the headline print likely seals the deal for another taper from the Bank of Canada later this month, there’s still a ways to go to fully heal the labor market,” he said in a note.

REUTERS/Christinne Muschi OTTAWA, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Canada's trade surplus with the world widened in August, easily beating analyst expectations, as strong exports of energy products outweighed a drop a two-way trade for motor vehicles and parts, data showed on Tuesday. The country's trade surplus was C$1.94 billion ($1.54 billion) in August, well ahead of the average analyst estimate of a surplus of C$430 million and up from a surplus of C$736 million in July. Exports rose 0.8%, led by energy products - which rose to their highest level since March 2014 - and metal and non-metallic mineral products, which outweighed a drop in motor vehicle and parts exports. Imports, meanwhile, fell by 1.4%, mostly on a decline in motor vehicle and parts imports. ""As we expected, the global chip shortage continued to impact production in that (motor vehicle) sector,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a note. ""The fact that the wider-than-expected surplus was largely the result of more weakness in goods imports than anticipated will likely blunt any impacts from the data on the Canadian dollar,"" he added.

Picture taken March 20, 2021. REUTERS/Carlos Osorio/File Photo/File Photo CALGARY, Alberta, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Canada on Monday invoked a 1977 treaty with the United States to trigger bilateral negotiations over Enbridge Inc's (ENB.TO) Line 5, escalating a long-running dispute over one of Canada's major oil export pipelines. Line 5 ships 540,000 barrels per day of crude and refined products from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario, but the state of Michigan ordered Enbridge to shut it down by May due to worries a leak could develop in a four-mile section running beneath the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes. Enbridge ignored Michigan's order and the sides are embroiled in a legal battle. The government of Canada has been pushing counterparts in the United States to intervene, and Monday's move marks a step up in Ottawa's efforts to help safeguard the pipeline. read more Invoking the treaty will force U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to get involved in the Line 5 dispute, said Ian Lee, a business professor at Ottawa's Carleton University. ""They're going to escalate it up to the nation-to-nation level, and hopefully we will have a resolution,” Lee said, adding that for Ottawa, a shutdown would be a political catastrophe. The U.S. State Department not immediately respond to requests for comment on Line 5, the latest in a series of Canadian export pipeline headaches for the Biden administration. In January the president revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, drawing dismay from Ottawa. Last week environmentalists criticized him for failing to halt Enbridge's Line 3 replacement project, which boosts flows of oil sands crude to U.S. refineries. read more 1977 TREATY In a letter to the U.S. federal judge presiding over the case, Gordon Giffin, legal counsel for the Canadian government, said Canada had formally invoked Article Six of the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty. The treaty has never been invoked before. Line 5 is governed by a provisions of the agreement guaranteeing uninterrupted transit of light crude oil and natural gas liquids between the two countries, Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said in a statement. ""Today, Canada is formally invoking the dispute settlement provision of the 1977 Agreement to ensure its full application,"" Garneau said. Article Six is used to resolve disputes, and Giffin's letter asked the court to halt any proceedings related to Michigan's Line 5 shutdown order while that is ongoing. Environmental campaigners criticized that move as a delaying tactic. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel dismissed the letter and said it had no legal basis for holding up the case. ""I am disappointed that the Government of Canada continues to align itself with Enbridge's desire to keep using State-owned lands to pump oil through the heart of the Great Lakes, threatening our most precious public resources,"" Nessel said in a statement. Earlier this year Enbridge and Michigan took part in court-ordered mediation, but Enbridge spokeswoman Tracy Larsson said Michigan has said it is not committed to further talks. ""We greatly appreciate the efforts of 'Team Canada'...for their commitments and efforts to keep Line 5 open,"" she said in an email.

REUTERS/Christinne Muschi OTTAWA, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Canada's economy likely rebounded in August from a slight contraction in July, buoyed by growth in the hospitality industry, though a withering drought will continue to drag on the important agriculture sector, data showed on Friday. The Canadian economy contracted 0.1% in July, just beating analyst estimates of a decline of 0.2%, but likely grew by 0.7% in August on jumps in services and manufacturing, Statistics Canada said. The August number is a preliminary estimate. With the expected rise in August, total economic activity is about 1% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. ""The slightly smaller-than-expected setback in July and nice pop in August suggest that the economy managed to grind out some moderate growth in the summer quarter as a whole,"" Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. The July decline came as a heat wave hit the agriculture sector and manufacturers were dragged down by supply chain woes, while construction declined for the third month in a row. This was partially offset by strong momentum in services, as the easing of public-health measures continued to drive a rebound in hospitality and tourism, Statscan said. That strength in services is expected to extend into August and beyond, even as a harsh fourth wave of COVID-19 infections weighs on the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Analysts said the Bank of Canada will likely go ahead with another tapering in its Oct. 27 rate decision, though the August gain is likely not enough to move the dial for the central bank on interest rates - especially after a disappointing second-quarter contraction. ""We think the likelihood of (the Bank of Canada) soon following other global central banks in taking a hawkish turn is low,"" Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. The Canadian dollar was nearly unchanged at 1.2675 per greenback, or 78.90 U.S. cents.
