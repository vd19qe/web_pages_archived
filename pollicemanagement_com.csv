So much so, I thought I’d take the time to expand upon it. Let me begin by saying I am not an expert in mental health nor do I pretend to be however, as a person who has suffered from and continue to experience mental health challenges, I think I am in a position to offer some type of personal insight into this illness. Mental health is exactly that – an illness; not a weakness. In Canada, October 10th is World Mental Health Day, it’s a yearly occurrence however, for 6.7 million Canadians – everyday is World Mental Health Day. According to the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) one in five Canadians experience or are experiencing mental health challenges or illness each year. This means that approximately 500,000 employees are unable to work everyday due to mental health challenges. Morneau Shepell a provider of Human Resource services that deliver an integrated approach to employee wellbeing reports that mental health issues in the workplace are among the top concerns for Canadian organizations and these concerns are well founded. Overview The overall health of a workplace includes both the physical and psychological wellbeing of the employee. By treating mental health and its psychological component equally with the physical environment, a workplace can support their employees overall wellbeing. Poor mental health not only hampers the employee, it also reduces corporate profits, increases employee turnover and absenteeism and increases conflict. It is important that all levels of the organization be involved in mental health of the workplace. It is a shared responsibility for the health and safety of all employees. For Canadian organizations to be effective in dealing mental health challenges, it is imperative that they understand the concept of mental health, mental illness and their impact in the workplace. Employees report workplace stress as a primary cause of their mental health problems or illness with depression and anxiety noted as the top two issues. So, what are the common symptoms / behaviours that leaders ought to look for in the workplace from employees that suffer from mental health issues? Kelly Greenwood and Natasha Krol of Mind Share Partners in their paper reinventing Health Care in the Workplace point to the fact that the following may be apparent; missed deadlines reduced productivity reduced quality of work absenteeism or lateness relationship issues or conflict with coworkers withdrawal or reduced participation loss of confidence, anxiety and fearfulness change in physical appearance lasting sadness and / or irritability extreme high and lows crying for no apparent reason In addition, medical professionals at McMaster University Hospital point to the fact that mental health issues are a large contributor to obesity, anorexia, respiratory and heart problems. To further exacerbate these health issues, the Morneau Shepell / MHCC white paper state that employees use coping skills such as increasing tobacco, cannabis and alcohol as a means to counter mental health issues. The white paper further explains that suicide remains a top concern with 58 % of the white paper respondents reporting that they had considered taking their lives to cope with mental illness. Issues In The Workplace The Covid – 19 pandemic has had a positive benefit for mental health suffers and advocates as well as organizations. It has long been known that mental health has been an issue that requires attention but, for many organizations it was ignored. Covid – 19 has forced organizations to deal with these challenges. Research conducted by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety has identified psychosocial risk factors (PRF) that may have an impact on organizational health, the health of leaders and employees and the health of profit margins. The way work is now carried out and the context in which work occurs is having a significant impact on employee mental health – positively and negatively. When employees have negative exposure to these factors, there is potential for depressed mood swings, anxiety, burnout and demoralization. It is incumbent for organizations to consider these items in their efforts to create a mentally healthy workplace. These PRF’s are: Organizational culture Psychological support Clear leadership Civility & respect in the workplace Workload management Work life balance Engagement Communication Empathy Workplace issues that affect mental health include: Discrimination Presenteeism Job burnout Harassment, violence, bullying and mobbing Substance abuse Isolation What Can Organizations Do? There are a number of items that organizations might like to consider in order to prepare for and combat the fallout associated with mental health. To that end, I offer organizations six recommendations to address the broader context of employee mental health. Prioritize workplace mental health Provide a range of mental health resources, support and care Create and support virtual mental health services Train front line leaders to recognize potential mental health issues Commit to an alcohol / drug policy Invest in the social determinants of health (racism, sex and gender inequality, social exclusion, loneliness) What Can Leaders Do? Even in these uncertain and unstructured times, the role of a leader remains the same; support your team members including supporting mental health in the workplace. The good news is that many of the techniques required to do so are the same ones that make you an effective leader. These techniques include: Communication Transparency Check in with employees regularly Model healthy behaviours Sensitivity to employee needs Proactivity Be an organizational conduit Summary: As much as we might like to return to the way things were – we won’t. Let us use this opportunity to create a mentally healthy workplace culture whereby employees and leaders collaborate to continually improve the health, safety and wellbeing of all employees and sustain the productivity of the business. Given the fact that we invest one third of our lives at work, the working environment can have a significant impact on our health and wellbeing. A healthy working environment is one in which there is not only an absence of harmful conditions that can cause injury and illness, but an abundance of health promoting ones. About The Author.

422824,20210108,pollicemanagement.com,https://pollicemanagement.com/choosing-strategies-for-change/,text/html,text/html,en,"Choosing Strategies for Change | Pollice Management Group 905.517.0193 nick@pollicemanagement.com Home Who we are Nick’s Bio What We Do Public Appearances Our Clients Articles Media Contact Select Page Choosing Strategies for Change Choosing Strategies for Change Jan 1, 2021 | Planning Change, is traumatic and for some it can be good while for others – it can be frightening. Change by nature can challenge employment, make people feel somewhat threatened by any alteration in the status quo or give organizations a path forward to a more prosperous future. Disruption accompanies change and these disruptions affect employees, leaders, resources, vendors and perhaps some clients. Organizations by their very being must change, and managers must implement changes and overcome resistance to them. This of course has never been more pronounced than the situation we find ourselves in today. From a positive perspective, COVID 19 has forced organizations to make changes that should have been made three to five years ago however, some of these changes are being conducted with little or no well thought out future goals or objectives in mind. Dora Wang (Partner, Reed Smith Global Regulatory Enforcement Group, New York) says that most change efforts in organizations change because organizations are ineffective in choosing the right strategy for change. In her 2016 article titled; Change Management, she points out the following reasons for organizational change failure. 37 % of change efforts fail to meet targeted expectations, 23 % of change efforts fail because leadership behaviour does not support the change, 19 % of change efforts fail because employees are resistant and management fail to address this resistance, 12 % of change efforts fail because of a lack of adequate funding, 5 % of change efforts fail because of a lack of consistent and constant communication, 4 % of change efforts fail for other reasons. Why Do Organizations Need a Change Strategy? Developing and selecting the right change strategy provides direction and meaning for all change management activities. By identifying the unique elements of the change like risks, resistance, time lines, capital and resources; change implementers set themselves up for success. A “one size fits all” approach to change management strategies is not effective because all organizations are unique onto themselves. Just to name a few, wrap your head around these changes: acquiring a company of near or equal size, getting vendors to use a new web based payables system, implementing a COVID 19 alert system, relocation of offices, changes in corporate leadership, new vendor application, implementing a mental health policy and procedure. All of these aforementioned changes have one thing in common – they are very different in nature and application and require a variable strategy for success. Change management strategies ultimately define the required approach given the circumstances and end goals of your change initiative. Steps In Creating Strategies For Change. Identifying Change Characteristics: Understanding and being able to define the change and its relative scope allows change makers the opportunity to formulate the base of successful change. Some elements to consider are: What is the change? What is the scope of the change? What does the change look like? How will the change be communicated? Where will the change happen? Who / what might the change affect (processes, systems, job roles, etc.)? When will the change take effect? Why is the change required? What is the timeline for the change and does it compete with other initiatives? Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden changeMary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Novelist Taking An Environmental Scan: Being knowledgeable in organizational change history culture is something to not be overlooked because it provides an insight into corporate culture and values. In essence, these two items (culture and values) are a strong indicator as to how an organization will accept and support the change. An environmental scan would include: What is the organizational back story that affects the change (eg: history & culture)? What is the perceived need associated with this change amongst employees, managers, corporate future? How have past changes been managed? What were the successes and failures of these changes? Is there a shared vision for these changes? Who are the employees affected by this change and what is the relevant impact of these changes? (revisit of step one) How does this change affect our corporate vision, mission and our strategic plan? How much change is taking place now in the organization and how does this change affect those current changes? Internal Audit: Since we know that 23 % of change efforts fail because leadership behaviour does not support the change and19 % of change efforts fail because employees are resistant and management fail to address the resistance, an internal audit will enable us to anticipate some of the aforementioned behaviour while predicating success. At the internal audit stage consideration ought to be give to: Ensure that the leaders at the top of the organizational “food chain” understand the change and are on side. Seek feedback from all key change agents and listen to what they have to say. Redefine exactly what the change is. Create specific, measureable, achievable, realistic and time bound change parameters. Simplify the change into easily digestible pieces for mass communication. Expecting & Planning For Resistance: Expecting and planning for resistance to change is a prudent way of effectively anticipating and managing objections and allows you the opportunity to plan your change strategy. In his article “Change Rarely Comes Easily”, strategy consultant Torben Rick points to the following model (Figure One) of resistance that cloud peoples judgment and can make change difficult if not incorporated into a change management strategy. This brings me to a law of physics. The original form of Newton’s Second Law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force that is acting upon the object. Therefore, Newton’s Second Law states that: Force (F) = Mass (M) X Acceleration (A). So, what does this have to do with an organizational strategy for change? EVERYTHING! You see, if “Mass” is high, which implies that the scope of change is very broad and touches the most important aspects of our business the “Force” necessary to enable this change to take place, will be high. Also, if “Acceleration” is high, which means change has to take place immediately or in a very short period of time, the “Force” necessary to enable this change to take place, will also be high. Both these aforementioned scenarios have one thing is common; if force is high then “Resistance” amongst employees is high. The higher the “Resistance” the higher the “Force” resulting in dissension amongst employees. Why, because change is based on a Bond of Trust. Change is about looking at opportunities, having vision, making sure that people understand the change; it is about establishing trust and producing short term positive results in order to move forward. As managers we cannot always select the depth and breadth of change (Mass). That in most cases is an exogenous variable, it comes from corporate, however; in many cases we do have some control over the speed at which the change will take place (Acceleration). This is often referred to as an endogenous variable because it is derived internally. So why are we going through all this, because the slower, more methodical and pragmatic change can be, the higher the probability of success and the less resistance will be encountered along the path of change. Figure One Summary: Several events have confirmed the importance of organizational change. Today, more and more managers must deal with the pandemic, government regulations, new products and services, growth, increased competition, technological developments, and a rapidly changing workforce. In response, Kotter and Schlesinger argue (and rightfully so) that several organizations must undertake moderate organizational changes at least once a year and major changes every four or five years. Few organizational change efforts tend to be complete failures and few tend to be entirely successful. Most efforts encounter problems; they often take longer than expected and desired, they sometimes run the risk of killing morale. Also, they tend to cost a great deal in terms of managerial time, emotional upheaval and capital resources. More than a few organizations have not even tried to initiate needed changes because the managers involved were afraid that they were simply incapable of successfully implementing them because of the absence of a well thought out strategy for change that has input from employees who are affected by the change and are expected to champion elements of the change.

In their book Meaney and Keller addressed ten most basic challenges facing leaders today the first of which is attracting & retaining the right talent. Much to the astonishment of several senior leaders, nothing is more pronounced today as 30 % of all employees are looking for new career opportunities. The Canadian Labour Market remains favourable for job seekers and the result is twofold: for organizations, the competition for talent has grown fierce and they have to work harder to attract and retain the workers they need to drive their business. For job seekers, opportunities abound, and it’s become increasingly common for workers to yearn for change at some point or another. In a study conducted in November, 2019 by the Indeed Group they found that many people are planning to make major shifts and change careers altogether (jumping from, say, a role in marketing to one in finance). Others, however, are making more subtle changes and looking for new roles in the same field, but at different companies. Either way, job seekers are becoming more active in their search for the best job opportunity. In fact, according to a recent Indeed survey, the average Canadian has had five jobs and has worked at four companies. Indeed conducted a study to further understand job switching behaviour. What they found is that almost a third (32%) of respondents plan to change jobs within the next one or two years, and 25% have been actively recruited by another company in the last six months. Moreover, a mere 16% plan to stay with their current company for the next five years and this is taking into consideration our current Covid 19 environment. Why Is Talent Important To Organizations? Talent is important to organizations because superior talent has a tendency to be five times more productive than average employees. Meaney and Keller note that in a recent study of more than 600,000 researchers, entertainers, politicians and athletes; there was a 400 % difference in productivity when comparing superior talent to average talent. Canadian studies of businesses reveal that the gap in superiority rises as jobs become more complex. In highly complex occupations, the interaction and information exchange coupled with the intense work of managers, developers, researchers and like are as much as 800 % more productive. “Go after the cream of the cream. A small team of A+ players can run circles around a giant team of B & C players”The Late Steven Jobs, Apple, The war for Talent. The single largest constraint that organizations have to contend with today is the ability to hang on to talented people because talent is scarce. The “War For Talent” is a coined phrase that refers to the never ending battle to attract and retain talent in an advanced economy, at a time when too few workers are available to replace the baby boomers leaving the workforce. In March of 2019, Stats Canada reported that for every job hire a company receives 250 applications. That is a hiring ratio of .40 %. What that says is that it is harder to get accepted into Harvard Medical School (6.1%) than it is to be hired for a job in Canada This fact is backed by Meaney and Keller’s article research that showed Walmart had 230,000 applicants for 6,000 jobs (2.4%). Several Human Resources Professionals (HRP) point to the fact that one key element is that applicants just do not have the skill set (talent) to do the job and this challenge can even be more pronounced for organizations that have higher complex positions where stronger performers have a greater bottom line impact. Not to down play any jobs but, highly multi skilled trades personnel, heavy duty mechanics, commodity traders, procurement agents, merchandisers, accountants and specialized medical agents and engineers are just a few jobs that come to mind. Basford and Schaninger also point out that as Baby Boomers retire and take their experience with them and companies place emphasis on reducing costs, it makes it tougher on HRP’s to attract and maintain talent. Fabrizio Gagliardo, Talent Acquisition & Development Manager, Ferrero Canada says; “its not only a war for talent, it’s a war for individuals. There is just not enough individuals available to fill the job opportunities”. Adding to the war for talent and availability dilemma is that as top talent becomes increasing scarcer and companies are not on top of their recruiting game; some organizations will find that the top talent has been cherry – picked by other organizations that are prepared in their recruiting strategy. This coupled with the fact that the millennial generation (born 1981 – 1996) are far less loyal than their parents the war for talent will go to a whole new level. Canadian Labour Statistics show that employees stay at each job for 4.5 years and the average expected tenure of younger employees is approximately 2.2 years. Paul Maher, Human Resources Manager, Martinrea International says that “companies often under estimate the costs associated with turnover and the recruitment process associated with filling complex positions.” Stephanie Bradley, Human Resources Generalist at Hammond Power Solutions says that the more intensity, information and interaction required to fill complex positions is a true indicator that the threat to productivity increases as a person leaves the company. When talented people leave says Bradley, “the more time and money must be invested in the recruiting and onboarding process and this is just a start. If that talent leaves and pursues a career with the competition, the new employer now has a strategic and operational advantage and that cost is impossible to calculate”. The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) suggests that employers in Europe and North America will require 16 to 18 million more college – educated employees in the 2021 year than are available. This is an astonishing statistic given the fact that organizations in Canada may not be able to fill one in five roles they require, much less fill them with top talented applicants which would reflect a one in ten roles that are required. In our advanced world wide economy, it is conceivable that up to 90 million applicants could lack the skills required for full time employment. MGI goes onto to say that developing economies will face a shortfall of 45 million employees with a post secondary school education and high skills qualifications. Attracting Top Talent. In speaking to several HRP’s from a wide diverse group of companies, including public and private sectors, there seems to be a strong reliance on 15 key strategies that organizations may wish to consider in the 2021 year when it comes to attracting top talent. Although not in order of importance and acknowledging that not all 15 may apply to all organizations and sectors; there is an abundance of energy around these techniques. Further, I will not expand upon each item because they may have a different meaning and execution plan depending on your organizational climate and intent. (Note, if someone wishes to contact me and ask for my input as it pertains to these strategies I’ll gladly and complimentary provide such) They are: Leverage existing employees, Create a positive corporate culture to captivate talent, Build employer brands on social media, Put people first, Employ the use of Artificial Intelligence to make recruiting more effective, Develop and utilize education outreach programs, Attend as many job fairs as possible, Offer clarity, conviction and career opportunities, Know your Employee Value Proposition (EVP) by making your offer magnetic, Understand your target audience, Employee campus recruiting techniques, Have a flexible strategy, Add perks, Employ a shorter time to hire guideline, Utilize technological recruiting strategies. Retaining Top Talent. Managing employee retention is difficult at the best of times but, managing employee retention through uncertain times can be an impossible task. Balancing an optimal retention strategy with an engaging workforce and corporate financial reduction measures can be taxing on all HRP’s and the clients that they serve. Retaining top talent begins with a smart Retention Strategy. A Retention Strategy incorporates policies and plans that organizations follow to reduce employee turnover and attrition and ensure employees are engaged and productive long-term. The key challenge for businesses is ensuring a Retention Strategy aligns with business goals to ensure a maximum return on investment. A strong Retention Strategy considers: Employee Value Proposition, Employee salary, benefits and bonus, Workplace flexibility, Career development, Strong leader – employee relationship, A good employee experience. Employee Value Proposition (EVP): An EVP is quite easy to understand. It is comprised of three principles. They are: EVP 1 = value the skills, experience, personality and intrinsic elements that the employee has to offer the company. EVP 2 = value growth opportunities , culture, benefits, salary and career opportunities that the employer has to offer. EVP 3 = difficulty in replacing the employee should they decide to leave your organization. The calculation of the EVP is also quite easy to understand. Most organizations employ a Weighted Paired Comparison Analysis (WPCA) in order to emphasize the importance of each of the aforementioned EVP elements and decide as to where the emphasis ought to be. Employee Salary, Benefits & Bonus: Here is the all important question. Is the salary, benefit and bonus package that the organization is offering? It is no great secret that employee compensation considers three variables. The geographical location of the company, the qualifications required to perform the job and the difficulty in replacing the individual should they leave. The third variable is all about talent. As jobs evolve in complexity, difficulty in replacing individuals based on their knowledge, ability, skill and connections become extremely important. As one HRP told me; “we pay in the 80th percentile for talent because we know if we don’t, we’ll pay much more in the recruiting process.” In 2019 the Angus Reid Institute stated that 33 % of all individuals who left their job did so because they felt that they were not being fairly compensated and the Canadian Human Resources Professionals state that the investment to recruit a talented replacement is approximately $ 35,000. Workplace Flexibility: Given the current work environment and the needs of individuals, workplace flexibility has become a new tool for attracting, retaining and engaging employees. Workplace flexibility emphasizes the willingness and ability to adapt to change, particularly regarding how and when work gets done. In a flexible workplace, the needs of both employee and employer are met. With 25% of all Canadians saying that they rather work from home after the pandemic subsides and 30% saying they would be fine with working in the office two to three days per week, steering away from the traditional 9 – 5 work structure is mandatory in attracting and retaining solid employees. A structure that dictates the whereabouts of an employee is now moving to a model of flexibility that improves employee satisfaction. “Talent matters because of its scarcity, high value and difficulty in replacing it.Paul Maher, Manager, Human Resources. Martinrea International Workplace flexibility is more than creating employees schedules that best fit their needs or allowing them to work from home. It can include all kinds of working arrangements depending on the organization. They may include: Flexible arrival and departure times, Work location independence, Compressed shifts or workweeks, Part time work from home. Workplace flexibility is a phenomenon that is here to stay as human capital gets leaner. Career Development: Career development is the process of choosing a career, improving your skills and advancing along a career path. It’s a lifelong process of learning and decision-making that brings an individual closer to their ideal job, skillset, and lifestyle. Gone are the days where an employee has one job for life. Individuals coming into the workplace may have up to eight different jobs in their career and talented ones expect each job to improve their ability, skill and knowledge. The question smart organizations are asking; can those talented individuals have all eight different jobs in our organization. Organizations might like to consider taking a personal interest in employee career goals, promote training and personal work life balance and encourage mentoring and coaching. Strong Leader – Employee Relationship: Approximately 24 % of employees who left their job in 2018, did so because of a toxic working relationship with their leader. A leader and employee relationship is not only important to company productivity, it is the foundation of employee retention. A relationship that is built on trust and understanding can make the employee and leader relationship much more efficient and pleasant. A poor relationship that lacks cohesiveness will dampen productivity and lead to high rates of employee turnover. A Good Employee Experience: A strong Employee Experience encapsulates what people encounter and observe over the course of their tenure at an organization. Every company invests in the customer service / experiences and as organizations increasingly recognize people as their greatest assets, they’re investing in the employee experience as well. A positive employee experience in most cases requires more than showing up to work (virtually or physically), finishing your tasks, leaving and getting paid. Ideally workplaces have more to offer – like learning and development opportunities. “The employee experience is the journey an employee takes with your organization. It includes all the interactions an employee has with your organization before, during and after their tenure.”Fabrizio Gagliardo, Talent Acquisition & Development Manager, Ferrero Canada The essence of a good employee experience is underscored by great communication, transparency and trust. A good employee experience begins at the time of hire with the onboarding process and includes feedback, coaching and mentoring, autonomy and fair compensation. Summary: In order to treat people equally you must treat them differently because they are. There is no “one size fits all” strategy associated with attracting and retaining the right talent. This topic has been a sore spot for several organizations over the past decade and given our current and future business environment, organization will need to address this challenge now in order to be competitive in the future. Based on my experiences, this is one area where I believe municipalities (public sector) have out done private sector organizations over the past ten years. It appears that municipalities recognized the challenge ten years ago and took some major steps in bridging the gap. They have hired and retained some of the sharpest minds around. Perhaps others can take a lesson from them. Leaders will be required to reinforce the message that the “The Right Talent” designation is not primarily an acknowledgment of past accomplishments but, mainly an assessment of future contributions. The right talent initiatives must challenge and cultivate rising stars, not just celebrate today’s high achievements. Talented employees are the individuals who will launch new businesses, find new ways to reduce conversion costs, build better client and professional relationships and drive innovation.

Thousands of employees have experienced the agony and suffering that has been handed to them due to economic downturns, reduction in conversion costs, organizational rationalization, and mergers. Employees today are far less loyal and committed to their organizations than what they were ten years ago and for good reason. Canadian Labour Statistics show that employees stay at each job for 4.5 years and the average expected tenure of younger employees is approximately 2.2 years. Tessa Basford and Bill Schaninger of McKinsey & Company say that their research shows that “job hopping” is the new normal where millennials (born 1981 – 1996) are expected to hold 15 – 20 positions over the course of their working career. To counter the Job Hopping new normal it is important that Leaders invest time, effort and capital in changing the mind set and behaviour of employees. That is not to say that organizations can eliminate Job Hopping however, they can minimize its frequency and affect. Employees are expecting organizations to place their needs and wants first and rightfully so. With talent availability being low, job complexity increasing and competition for talent increasing many organizations are struggling in their endeavours in winning the hearts and minds of employees. Rebecca Skilbeck, (Head of Client Insights & Market Research at PageUp) states that employee expectations have changed. Employees “want to bring their authentic selves to work, be inspired and supported by their leaders and have the opportunity to learn, grow, develop and advance in their careers.” To that end, what are some leadership tactics that we as leaders can employ in winning the hearts and minds of our employees? Here are four building blocks that I believe will enable leaders do just that. Start From The Hiring Date: Starting from the very beginning is always a great place to start in delivering a great working experience. With job seekers having more options than ever before, they chose your organization to begin and / or advance their career. Fostering an understanding and conviction to the betterment of the employee is a critical step in building the employee experience. Job seekers are expecting a seamless hassle free experience. From the moment the employee walks in the door there is an expectation of “Value Matching”. The essence of a good employee experience is underscored by great communication, transparency and trust. A good employee experience begins at the time of hire with the onboarding process and includes feedback, coaching and mentoring, autonomy and fair compensation. Leadership: Leadership is a science and an art. The science portion is understanding the job, the measurements, the performance parameters and the idiosyncrasies associated with bottom line results. The art side is understanding people, their needs, their wants and this is where leaders ought to concentrate their efforts without losing sight of leadership science. Leadership is often referred to as being the process of motivating a team of people to act toward achieving a common goal. In a business setting, this can mean giving direction, provide coaching and mentoring to employees and colleagues with a strategy to meet the company’s needs. Exhibiting a high level of integrity, leaders will demonstrate to others their expectations. The manner in which a leader handles challenging situations or conflicts is one example of leadership opportunities for modeling strong integrity. By dealing with a conflict directly and in a transparent manner, leaders prove themselves to be honest, forthright managers with a high sense of values. Show Appreciation: If you are looking to win the hearts and minds of your team members, then you ought to learn the operational art of appreciating them for their efforts. An employee that feels acknowledged for their efforts will be more motivated toward following the vision you have for the organization. You can also establish a system that recognizes the top-performing employees of your organization. Showing appreciation can influence your level of persuasiveness and induce influence amongst your team members. Talent Management: Employees want to be challenged; they want to learn and develop those intrinsic and extrinsic skills that enable them to grow their confidence. Successful organizations must have a full range of talent management qualities in order to win the hearts and minds of employees in several environments and demographics. Given the declining pool of talent, compensation alone will not be the critical factor in this endeavour. Talent must feel that the organization has a deep interest in their career development. Personal and professional beliefs and corporate values are interwoven with position descriptions and short to the point / numerous performance feedback sessions. Organizations ought to realize that talent will not be retainable if they do not enjoy what they are doing, leaders fail to communicate effectively on a regular basis and they are not surrounded with talented employees who challenge them on a regular basis. Summary: Winning the hearts and minds of employees is not easy task and in a number of organizations it isn’t a priority. If organizations want to establish themselves as a leader, then they ought to take the time to understand employee dynamics and the personal goals and objectives of each employee. Aligning these aspects with organizational vision will help the engagement process of employees in a more efficient way. About The Author.

It is a comedy written in 1595 by William Shakespeare, played to an audience in Berkshire, England in 1602 and centres around an individual (John Falstaff) who decides to court two wealthy married women in his search for financial stability. The saying itself means the plain and simple truth or substance of discussion when numerous details are being presented and you wish to cut to the so called facts by removing yourself from all of the rhetoric. The other day I was reading a piece by Tim Arnold the President of Leaders for Leaders located in the Niagara Region of Ontario. Tim does a wonderful job in inspiring our leaders of today and preparing them for the challenges of tomorrow. Tim wrote about his interview with Allison Alley, President & CEO of Compassion Canada; a not for profit Canadian organization located in London, Ontario. What Allison and Tim had to say inspired me to take heed of the content and put some colour and private sector credibility into what was said. Not all content in this article is mine, it really belongs to Allison and Tim however, the real life, drama and experiences are mine and I’d like to share them with you. Since March 13, 2020, we have been inundated with Covid 19 news and most of it doom and gloom. From companies laying off workers at unprecedented rates, corporate closures and bankruptcies, citizens receiving pandemic relief funding that they weren’t entitled to and the erosion of the middle class – we have heard it all. Now no one is saying that the news isn’t true however; perhaps we ought to accentuate some of the positives and minimize the negatives during these depressing times. This brings me back to “The Long and Short of It” and that is – we have been through some turbulent times and we are coming out the other side albeit torn and tattered but, still standing because – we are great and so are the organizations that we are a part of. One thing Covid 19 has taught some organizations is that they might have to reinvent themselves while employing some of the following tactics in navigating the road to success during these unstructured and undefined times. This is my opportunity to tell you a little about how some of my clients (PHM Brands, Hammond Power Solutions, Martinrea and Mondelez Canada) are employing these tactics or a reasonable facsimile there of, to the greater good of their organizations. These tactics are: Systematizing the Present Setting Short Term Goals Employing Vision Dogmatism Being an Information Funnel Democratizing Knowledge Having Coffee with Team Members Systematize the Present: There are great things happening in an organization every day – even in the most difficult of times. Make sure people are aware of these signs of progress. Create programs and systems across the organization to capture and share these everyday wins. PHM Brands in Denver, Colorado employ a Thankful Tuesday program which encourages team members to express gratitude for what they have accomplished either on the job or outside the job in their personal lives. Mondelez Canada utilize a Good News Company Channel that gets uploaded with stories from staff and the people they serve every day, whether it be internal or external clientele. Both programs have one thing in common, it gives the employee the right to brag and feel great about their accomplishments and the effects are contagious. It’s a built in stabilizer that allows for employee engagement and motivation while providing a sense of self esteem and self awareness for team members who wish to participate. Set Short-Term Goals: Larry Lichty, Director of Human Resources at Hammond Power Solutions in Guelph, Ontario, always told the Corporate Leadership Team; “the longest journey begins with the shortest step and the shortest step is all about setting short term goals”. Perhaps that may be one of the reasons why Hammond is so successful in an extremely competitive industry and are an international powerhouse in providing electrical power based solutions the world over. It is not always possible to accomplish your vision right away, which means that team members need quick wins to stay optimistic and hopeful. Leaders ought to set “lead goals” for their team on things they have direct control over. Seeing these short-term goals achieved and celebrating the success together allows team members to realize they are having real impact and things are moving in a good direction. Vision Dogmatism: AKA “The Brady Principle”………it is imperative that leaders remind team members about the big picture and where we’re headed as an organization. People need to be constantly clear on – and inspired by – the corporate vision. Corporate vision leads to corporate progress and that reminds team members why their hard work and struggles are important and why it will be worth it in the end. PHM Brands Executive Vice Presidents, John Mason and Bryan Ledgerwood continuously talk about the corporate vision to their people, vendors, clients and investors because, as Mr. Mason stated; “we need our team to focus on the prize and forget about the things that we cannot control”. There is an old saying in the food and beverage industry and Mason and Ledgerwood firm believers in this philosophy and that is; when team members are doing the doings – they can’t be doing the don’ts Being An Information Funnel: As a leader you have to call things out and create a shared language and common understanding around the challenges you face as an organization. Accentuate the positives (past and present) and don’t lose sight of the challenges that face the company in the future. A technique made popular by E.D. Smith of Winona back in the early 80’s; the Information Funnel followed a pattern regular town hall sessions. These town hall sessions invested a considerable amount of time talking about the real time challenges that the company was facing and how these challenges may impact all team members. It was also a platform for positive reinforcement through key successes that allowed for growth and development and provided a way forward for all. The Information Funnel technique virtually worked itself through all business units in Winona and other facilities in the form of “Huddle Board” meetings which occurred ten minutes before the start of work and became a ritual onto itself. This technique proved to be extremely successful in terms of information update and exchange and lead to a 25 % decrease in costs of services provided. Democratization of Knowledge: Another technique that was founded by E.D. Smith of Winona was the Democratization of Knowledge Principle whereby; leaders make pertinent company data and strategy accessible to employees across the organization, regardless of their role or business unit. In doing so, organizations place everyone on a level playing field and allows team members to always feel they are “in the know”. This also means that individual and team work plans are shared knowledge to ensure everyone is clear on how we’re doing collectively and individually and how their efforts affect the overall success of the organization. Coffee with Team Members: There is a lesson for all Leaders to learn about having coffee with team members. The information glean that is derived is tantamount to company success because it creates a foundation of untapped wisdom. Paul Maher, Human Resources Manager at Martinrea International in Tillsonburg has an interesting philosophy. A man of courage and conviction, every week or so, he carves out sixty to ninety minutes to sit down with four to six team members from across the organization. With the value of radical candour (caring personally and challenging directly), he shares with them where Martinrea are as an organization and what he believes is coming around the corner. He also requests that team members share with him one thing that they think he doesn’t know but should know. Paul also invites comments around one thing that is not being talked about as an organization but, they believe we should be talking about. Watch Outs: The aforementioned strategies are not without risk. The risk is that the organization and leadership maybe over dosing optimism, confidence and communication with realism. Some of the tell tale signs centre around the following. Loss of Story: There are times when we as leaders put an abundance of energy into knowing the metrics and making sure our meetings and communications are data informed. However, we don’t pay close attention to the subservient feedback. Anytime a leader hears feedback from team members that your tactics have a tendency to be boring or lack energy and inspiration, think in terms of overpowering the organizations story and vision. It may also be people are getting tired of the “same old – same old”. Make it fun – make it interesting – make it the teams way. Running on Empty: We have super high expectations on each team member and realize that their jobs require them to navigate heavy issues that include accessing, hiring and onboarding the right people while getting the results we need to stay relevant. Despite this, our workplace culture is normally incredibly positive, and engagement is high. So, pay close attention to anytime you as a leader feel a sense of loss of focus and fatigue in team members. This may be a watch out that tells us we the leadership team need to find ways to boost optimism, positivity and a sense of well being. Summary: In the words of Allison Alley; “There is wisdom in the cliché, tough times don’t last, tough leaders do. Right now, the world needs effective leaders more than ever. Leaders who inspire those around them to have faith that our families, communities and businesses will overcome in the end, regardless of how tough things get. Leaders who can also help their teams, friends and families confront the brutal facts of the current reality, no matter how hard they are to face. This means we need leaders who refuse to be optimistic or realistic but, instead are both optimistic and realistic so that they can safely pave the way to a better and brighter future” And that is “The Long and Short of It” About The Author.

Leaders Today Need Vulnerability, Not Ego. May 1, 2021 | Uncategorized Vulnerability is defined as a willingness to show emotions or to allow one’s weakness to be seen or known; the willingness to risk being hurt or attacked. Contrary to some beliefs, the omnipotent leaders are not always the one’s that can guide their organizations through turbulent and uncertain times. Rather, the most effective leader may be the person(s) who are ready, willing and able to show their vulnerabilities. Vulnerability has quickly become a crucial leadership quality, one a leader must have in order to succeed in todays business world. When leaders show their vulnerability they open themselves up to be judged by others which places them at risk for feeling shame and embarrassment and both are powerful emotions. However, the more a leader knows of themselves to be worthy, regardless of their flaws, the less power shame and embarrassment has over them. Vulnerable leaders are aware that they make mistakes and in doing so they will be judged and be a topic of conversation. Several writers and researchers have done a marvellous job in in writing about vulnerable leadership; Kelsey Borresen, Brene Brown and Simon Sinek to name a few and all have drawn a similar conclusion; vulnerability is not a weakness, it is a strength that creates a space for leaders to let others into their head. As a leader, it’s important to remember that your people usually know if something is not working. They just want to know whether you have the courage to tell them. Dr. Brene Brown, (Sociologist, University of Texas) speaks to and conducts research in leadership vulnerability and her findings are astonishing. Her work explains that we all struggle with things in our lives and sharing them is not a sign of weakness, it’s actually an incredibly powerful method of building trust and confidence. Some of the most successful leaders show their vulnerabilities to themselves and others by admitting that they are wrong or they may not know the answers to specific challenges while having reservations about problems facing them today. They may also be somewhat pragmatic in their approach leading them to inadvertently test the patience of others. It begins by going out of your comfort zone and engaging others in the journey of self improvement. Organizations and their people are far better off when their leaders take the bold step to embracing the truth by understanding the reality of situations as opposed to being right and not accepting reality. What can leaders do to cultivate a more vulnerable style of leadership? Here are some suggestions: Be honest with your people. Leaders ought to be honest with themselves and others. Leadership honesty creates the foundation for a team of employees to work together, united in the same true sacrifice, helping each other to attain personal and corporate goals in order to be successful. A strong organization much like personal relationships are based on honesty and no leader can afford to be dishonest with themselves, their employees or clients. To treat people equally – you have to treat them differently, because they are. Honesty is the foundation of integrity. A leader, first and foremost, is human.Only when we have the strength to show our vulnerability can we truly lead. Simon Sinek Tell the truth. Vulnerable leaders share their candid perspective with others about what they know, what they think they know and what they don’t know. It is much more expedient and easier to tell people what they want to hear however, the best leaders tell the truth no matter how problematic that may be. When leaders are clear about the challenges ahead they help their team understand. Being open and honest about your weakness as a leader is a sign of strength and integrity. Ask for help. Asking for help will make teams stronger and it will make a leader stronger. Leadership is not about being the hero nor is it about being in charge. Leadership is unlocking the forces that bring employees together as a team in order to increase employee commitment by creating energy and unleashing ideas to tackle the challenges at hand. When you make a mistake, admit it. Amy Edmondson (Professor of Leadership & Management at Harvard) talks about admitting and apologizing for mistakes. She says that when leaders take this approach, people appreciate the honesty and trust no matter how disappointed they may be in hearing it. Amy states that the short term sense of invincibility that a leader may experience when refraining from admitting mistakes is usually short lived and delusional. Failure on behalf of a leader to admit that they are wrong will lead others to question the leaders self awareness, judgment and character when the truth becomes evident. Moving outside the comfort zone. One thing that leaders are reluctant to do is to go out of their comfort zone. Unfamiliarity causes performance to suffer and their vulnerability is exposed short term. What some leaders fail to realize is that operating outside the comfort zone will make you a better leader because you are learning new skills. Leading within your comfort zone leads to stagnation and a loss of a learning opportunity. One of the reasons so many people fail to develop into highly effective leaders is that they stagnate and operate on autopilot, self – perpetuating their habits and repeating what has worked in the past. Thomas Chamorro – Premuzic Communicate. A number of leaders that I coach and consult with are not very good communicators. They do not make communication a priority and they assume that people just know. In my experience this can be a recipe for disaster. As we engage others in the journey of self awareness and self improvement, feedback is pivotal to our overall leadership success. Helping your team members advance their knowledge and skill set will improve leadership skills and allow others to share their knowledge. Avoid defensiveness. When leaders communicate with team members they are vulnerable. Leaders will naturally hear negative feedback and may translate that feedback to a personal attack. The mind set must be – it isn’t personal, its business. Leaders must remain calm, dig deeper to understand and ask questions that spark a deeper conversation. This allows the leader to be comfortable with uncomfortable moments and have constructive conversations about feelings and emotions. Summary. A vulnerable leadership style in a world of extreme uncertainty, interdependence and complexity is vital in making progress when answers are not apparent. In a number of cases what we’ve done in the past isn’t applicable and exogenous factors affect the way forward. Others in our organization may be able to contribute vital knowledge and ideas and a vulnerable leader will be able to tap that opportunity. Vulnerable leaders keep their people close and let them know that they care. About The Author.

Vulnerable leaders share their candid perspective with others about what they know, what they think they know and what they don’t know. It is much more expedient and easier to tell people what they want to hear however, the best leaders tell the truth no matter how problematic that may be. When leaders are clear about the challenges ahead they help their team understand. Being open and honest about your weakness as a leader is a sign of strength and integrity. Ask for help. Asking for help will make teams stronger and it will make a leader stronger. Leadership is not about being the hero nor is it about being in charge. Leadership is unlocking the forces that bring employees together as a team in order to increase employee commitment by creating energy and unleashing ideas to tackle the challenges at hand. When you make a mistake, admit it. Amy Edmondson (Professor of Leadership & Management at Harvard) talks about admitting and apologizing for mistakes. She says that when leaders take this approach, people appreciate the honesty and trust no matter how disappointed they may be in hearing it. Amy states that the short term sense of invincibility that a leader may experience when refraining from admitting mistakes is usually short lived and delusional. Failure on behalf of a leader to admit that they are wrong will lead others to question the leaders self awareness, judgment and character when the truth becomes evident. Moving outside the comfort zone. One thing that leaders are reluctant to do is to go out of their comfort zone. Unfamiliarity causes performance to suffer and their vulnerability is exposed short term. What some leaders fail to realize is that operating outside the comfort zone will make you a better leader because you are learning new skills. Leading within your comfort zone leads to stagnation and a loss of a learning opportunity. One of the reasons so many people fail to develop into highly effective leaders is that they stagnate and operate on autopilot, self – perpetuating their habits and repeating what has worked in the past. Thomas Chamorro – Premuzic Communicate. A number of leaders that I coach and consult with are not very good communicators. They do not make communication a priority and they assume that people just know. In my experience this can be a recipe for disaster. As we engage others in the journey of self awareness and self improvement, feedback is pivotal to our overall leadership success. Helping your team members advance their knowledge and skill set will improve leadership skills and allow others to share their knowledge. Avoid defensiveness. When leaders communicate with team members they are vulnerable. Leaders will naturally hear negative feedback and may translate that feedback to a personal attack. The mind set must be – it isn’t personal, its business. Leaders must remain calm, dig deeper to understand and ask questions that spark a deeper conversation. This allows the leader to be comfortable with uncomfortable moments and have constructive conversations about feelings and emotions. Summary. A vulnerable leadership style in a world of extreme uncertainty, interdependence and complexity is vital in making progress when answers are not apparent. In a number of cases what we’ve done in the past isn’t applicable and exogenous factors affect the way forward. Others in our organization may be able to contribute vital knowledge and ideas and a vulnerable leader will be able to tap that opportunity. Vulnerable leaders keep their people close and let them know that they care. About The Author.

Given the upheaval that we have experienced over the past twenty months, servant leadership has been taking on a life of its own in some major organizations. This is a very different approach from the traditional leadership style where the leader’s main focus is the thriving of their company, usually based on metrics. A servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as efficiently and effectively as possible. In other words, servant leadership inverts the norm, which puts the customer and the employee as a main priority. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people. Servant leaders are seen as being a revolutionary bunch because they possess a serve first mindset and are focused on empowering and uplifting those who take direction from them. They tend to serve rather than command, show humility rather than brandishing authority look to enhance the development of followers in ways that unleash potential, innovation and sense of purpose As stated by its founder, Robert K. Greenleaf, a servant leader should be focused on, “Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servant leaders?” When leaders shift their mindset and serve first, they benefit as well as their employees in that their employees acquire personal growth, while the organization grows as well due to the employees growing commitment and engagement. Since this leadership style came about, a number of different organizationshave adopted this style as their way of leadership. According to a 2017 study done by Sen Sendjaya and James C Sarros, servant leadership is being practiced in some of the top-ranking companies, and these companies are highly ranked because of their leadership style and following. Some leadership traditionalists will argue that servant leadership is a bad practice because it’s paternalistic and gets in the way of employee engagement. They say “just when we need to empower front line knowledge workers to think for themselves and take more ownership, the last thing they need is to be served by their managers”. Some of my clients share this view and I do understand their thought process however, the opposite argument to this is that a servant leader is not threatened by the ideas and inputs of others. Instead, they regularly seek out feedback and consider the opinions of others. This type of behaviour encourages innovation and will carry your business into the future because it encourages engagement, self esteem and self motivation. While the traditional style of leadership is focused on helping an organization thrive, servant leadership put the needs of their employees first. They focus on developing individuals who perform their best. When traditional leaders think of servant leadership they think of people such as; Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Theresa and Barack Obama. Servant leaders on the other hand think of Mary Barra, Kevin Johnson, Thomas Nealon, Karen Lynch, Sami Siddiqui, James Nordstrom, Rosalind Brewer and Anthony Capuano. If these names aren’t familiar perhaps the names of the organizations that they currently lead as President might be; General Motors, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, CVS Health, Popeye’s Louisiana Chicken, Nordstrom’s, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Marriott International. These aforementioned organizations are not only lead by servant leaders – they are successful and provide a gracious return to their shareholders. Servant leadership moves beyond the transactional aspects of management. Instead it actively seeks to develop and align an employees sense of purpose with organizational values and corporate mission by empowering staff to perform at a high and innovative level while reducing employee turnover. Well trained employees become trusted staffers while continuing to develop future leadership skills thus helping to ensure long term corporate viability. “the most effective leaders are servants of their people. Servant leaders get results for their organization through the whole hearted attention to their people and the needs of their people” Kevin Johnson, President Starbucks. Servant leadership starts with an unselfish mindset. A servant leader knows that it is less about them and more about their employees. As a servant leader its not only about what gets done, its how it gets done. In servant leadership you can say what you want but, you are going to be judged based on your behaviour and that behaviour in turn shapes employee perception and that is what counts. Servant leaders aim to share power with others and encourage the development and growth of others. This trait can extend to listening to followers carefully to better understand their needs, but it also involves leaders holding themselves and others accountable for their words and actions. The five principles associated with servant leadership are listening, empathy, self – awareness, relationship management and foresight. Listening: Servant leaders listen to people before they speak. They have a high desire to know what others think, feel and expect. Servant leaders give others their undivided attention and pay specific attention to the body language, tone of voice and word selection of others. Crafting questions through strong listening skills allows for the servant leader to gain a greater insight into other points of view. Even if the leader feels the need to disagree or interject, they wait until the other party is finished speaking, summarize what they think is said and ensure a better understanding. Also, listening allows for stewardship accountability; possessing the ability to take responsibility for the actions, behaviours and performance of the team because it sets the benchmark performance indicators. Empathy: The most successful servant leader is the one that has been there before. They feel for their people and don’t turn away from the challenges or issues that their people are experiencing. Servant leaders attempt to help others resolve those issues that are impeding their success by committing to their growth and development while removing barriers to optimal work performance. Empathy is a prerequisite for servant leaders because the leaders must ascertain whether the other party is worth serving. Empathy helps the employee recognize that the leader has their best interest at heart and acts as the foundation for mutual trust. Self – Awareness: Self – awareness to the servant leader is their ability to perceive and understand their emotions and the potential impact on others; it is also the first principle of emotional intelligence. Being subtle and sensitive to the emotional response of others is the key to successful and influential communication because it allows the servant leader to reduce stress and conflict in a potentially emotional responsive moment. Relationship Management: The fourth principle of emotional intelligence is relationship management; the ability to manage the emotions of others by stimulating communication and influence the other parties decision – making process and outcome. To the servant leader it is the extrinsic social mastery component that allow others to listen, minimize resistance and optimize the collaboration. Being aware and being in the moment is crucial to the overall success of the servant leader because it minimizes the authority factor and motivates others to take the desired course of action. Foresight: Servant leaders have that sixth sense of anticipating events and challenges while understanding the potential impact on others. The ability to foresee is an acquired technique which is based on experience, learning and the analysis of past events. Popular business tools such as “SWOT” analysis, needs and wants assessment and paired comparison relationships are just a few techniques that will allow a servant leader to predict the future and make an educated assessment. “I serve because I am the leader, and I am the leader because I serve” – Karen Lynch, President CVS Health. Implications Associated With Servant Leadership: It is my belief that servant leadership is a cultural change rather than a management technique change. You must want to change, remember it is all about an unselfish mindset. Although the servant leadership concept was introduced seventy plus years ago, it remains relatively new to many because it forces leaders out of their comfort zone and exposes vulnerability. Forbes Coaches Council Member, Brian Tate points out that leaders who implement this style of leadership should ensure that it is done ethically and honestly. If the leader does not behave ethically and only obsequiously practices servant leadership for the benefit of the organization, this will decrease employee engagement and hamper business growth and development by creating a culture of mistrust and a lack of transparency. Mystique & Criticism of Servant Leadership: Critiques of servant leadership claim that Jesus not Greenleaf, introduced the notion of servant leadership to the everyday life of human endeavours. Sendjaya and Sarros argue that the Bible account clearly states that the servant leadership principle was so important to Christianity that it was captured by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John as they wrote the Gospel of the Lord. Feminist scholars have noted that servant leaders have a particular view of themselves as stewards who are entrusted to develop and empower followers to reach their fullest potential based on patriarchal approaches to leadership which is attributed to masculinity and leadership discourse. Black scholars have pointed out how notions of servants as being subjugated and mistreated is largely absent from servant leadership discourse. They also note that although Greenleaf attributes his ideas to Herman Hesse however, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached servant leadership and was a contemporary of Greenleaf but, Dr. King is never mentioned in any of Greenleaf’s works. Other scholars have pointed out that servant leadership is a hierarchical model in a cyclical process that consists of behavioural components (vision & service) and relational components (influence, credibility & trust) that are more transcendental models of leadership and do not serve neither transformational or transactional models of leadership that are prevalent in the business world today. It is not necessary to have a high influence role in your company to start practicing the servant leadership style, but it’s a practice that has a huge impact on employee well-being and engagement. Summary: I am a proponent of servant leadership because it really defines what a leader needs to be in today environment. It is my opinion that servant leadership can be accomplished at any level in the organization. Some examples may include leading projects by supporting the rest of your colleagues, addressing their needs, providing resources and support and being there for your people in a proactive manner may show successful and positive results at any level. By practicing your communication skills, develop empathy, work on your self – awareness and be sure to focus on developing your employees you’ll be well on your way to becoming a capable and effective servant leader.

Michelle Ock Manager, Organizational Development Toronto Hydro Electric System Nick is a skilled facilitator. Over our three day period, he was able to capture and maintain the attention and participation levels of the entire group. Nick offered practical solutions that were relevant to todays managers. My time with Nick was a great experience. Kathryn Weidhass Manager, Human Resources – Employee Relations, City of Waterloo Nick was a great facilatator. I waited for almost a year to attend one of his public courses. He was everything my coworkers said he was. He gave us many opportunities to participate and everyone did. After leaving I felt full and complete. Absolutely loved Nick’s examples of the good, bad and ugly management practices that he has experienced. Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days. It really challenged me in a large part and this can only attributed to your skillful facilitating skills. Illustrating the various behavioural types that we may or may not encounter has enabled me to be a more confident and courageous leader. I wish I had additional time to glean more knowledge from your vast experiences and knowledge, I seemed to be soaking it up like a sponge and just wanted more and more. Keep up the great work and enthusiasm, I will definitely look for additional training where you are the facilitator. Chris Callaghan, C.Tech. Peterborough Utilities Services Inc. Over the past twenty plus years, we have engaged Nick’s facilitation and coaching expertise and have found him to be current in his knowledge and extremely professional.

Fabrizio Gagliardo Manager, Talent Acquisition & Development, Ferrero Canada Nick is a very engaging and highly skilled facilitator who made a lasting impression on our managers. We contacted Nick late in the game and he came prepared. With very little notice he provided our new managers with up to date training filled with hands on learning and real life experiences. Nick operations and business background was so solid that he could relate to our managers and the challenges they face. We are bringing Nick back to do the same training for another set of managers and hiring him to develop a specialized program that will build on concepts learned in this initial training. Laura Fitzsimmons Strategic HR Business Advisor. Ontario Clean Water Agency. Nick is an experienced high skilled facilitator and trainer who relates well to people and their workplace challenges. He is able to put issues in perspective and address challenges with intelligence and wisdom. His knowledge and experience show through with some of our most closed minded – too old to change leaders.

Lori Davis Hill. BScN, MSc. Director, Family Health Services, Six Nations. If you want mediocre training for your supervisors and managers hire someone else. If you are interested in motivating, escalating skill sets, committed to high performance and continuous improvement and want to build a leadership team at a level unknown to most, hire Nick Pollice. Nick will build cohesion with your group that can take some years to do and he does it with a sense of class that is second to none. Peter Ayers Plant Manager, Belden Incorporated I just wanted to comment on the absolutely outstanding job the facilitator Nick Pollice did with the Leadership session the past two days. My expectations were more than met with his methods and delivery. I look forward for the opportunity to attend further programs if Nick would once again be the facilitator. He was top notch; excellent sourcing for the City of Kitchener. City of Kitchener Employee I gained a great deal from Nick’s personalized coaching techniques. Our one on one coaching sessions helped me understand that the most important thing that I can do in life is listen. Listen for the verbal, vocal and visual aspects of the communication process. Nick embedded the finer points of Emotional Intelligence and Neuro Linguistic Programming techniques that has enabled me to understand the true position of our employees and the business at large.

Larry Lichty, Director Human Resources Hammond Power Solutions I requested Nick for three mediation sessions in Calgary, Alberta. In all three sessions, he came into a rather tense situation filled with disintegration and anarchy. Nick engaged union and company officials in separate meetings and was able to facilitate a fabulous and productive conversation between all parties, resulting in three successful mediated solutions. He saved us a significant sum of money and was able to lay the foundation for better working relationships between all parties. We continue to use Nick’s talents on a regular basis. He did a wonderful job and is well respected in our company Geoff Smith. BA, CHRP, MBA. Director, Human Resources, St. Gobain Inc.

He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

What our clients say Nick designed, delivered and monitored a customized in house Train The Trainer program that incorporated adult learning and facilitation techniques that were instrumental in improving the growth and development of our apprentices. Michelle Ock Manager, Organizational Development Toronto Hydro Electric System Nick is a skilled facilitator. Over our three day period, he was able to capture and maintain the attention and participation levels of the entire group. Nick offered practical solutions that were relevant to todays managers. My time with Nick was a great experience. Kathryn Weidhass Manager, Human Resources – Employee Relations, City of Waterloo Nick was a great facilatator. I waited for almost a year to attend one of his public courses. He was everything my coworkers said he was. He gave us many opportunities to participate and everyone did. After leaving I felt full and complete. Absolutely loved Nick’s examples of the good, bad and ugly management practices that he has experienced. Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days. It really challenged me in a large part and this can only attributed to your skillful facilitating skills. Illustrating the various behavioural types that we may or may not encounter has enabled me to be a more confident and courageous leader. I wish I had additional time to glean more knowledge from your vast experiences and knowledge, I seemed to be soaking it up like a sponge and just wanted more and more. Keep up the great work and enthusiasm, I will definitely look for additional training where you are the facilitator. Chris Callaghan, C.Tech. Peterborough Utilities Services Inc. Over the past twenty plus years, we have engaged Nick’s facilitation and coaching expertise and have found him to be current in his knowledge and extremely professional. In developing our leadership team, his expertise has delivered measureable positive results and we continue to utilize his services today. Paul Boyd, Manager Manufacturing Stackpole PMD We have engaged Nick’s services over the past several years for our Operations Management Team. All of our team members have been and continue to be extremely satisfied with the quality and depth of training and follow up that Nick provides. I highly recommend engaging Nick’s expertise. Fabrizio Gagliardo Manager, Talent Acquisition & Development, Ferrero Canada Nick is a very engaging and highly skilled facilitator who made a lasting impression on our managers. We contacted Nick late in the game and he came prepared. With very little notice he provided our new managers with up to date training filled with hands on learning and real life experiences. Nick operations and business background was so solid that he could relate to our managers and the challenges they face. We are bringing Nick back to do the same training for another set of managers and hiring him to develop a specialized program that will build on concepts learned in this initial training. Laura Fitzsimmons Strategic HR Business Advisor. Ontario Clean Water Agency. Nick is an experienced high skilled facilitator and trainer who relates well to people and their workplace challenges. He is able to put issues in perspective and address challenges with intelligence and wisdom. His knowledge and experience show through with some of our most closed minded – too old to change leaders. We have utilized Nick’s talents since 1995 and continue to capitalize on his availability. He gets results and leaves a positive indelible mark. Paul Maher. BA, MBA, MSc. Director, Human Resources. Meridian Light Weight Technologies International Nick’s extroverted style and pragmatic approach to Strategic Planning enabled our management team to develop a five year strategic plan with measureable yearly objectives. His sensitivity towards all members of our management team allowed us the opportunity to participate in an open and friendly environment. The end result was well worth the investment. Lori Davis Hill. BScN, MSc. Director, Family Health Services, Six Nations. If you want mediocre training for your supervisors and managers hire someone else. If you are interested in motivating, escalating skill sets, committed to high performance and continuous improvement and want to build a leadership team at a level unknown to most, hire Nick Pollice. Nick will build cohesion with your group that can take some years to do and he does it with a sense of class that is second to none. Peter Ayers Plant Manager, Belden Incorporated I just wanted to comment on the absolutely outstanding job the facilitator Nick Pollice did with the Leadership session the past two days. My expectations were more than met with his methods and delivery. I look forward for the opportunity to attend further programs if Nick would once again be the facilitator. He was top notch; excellent sourcing for the City of Kitchener. City of Kitchener Employee I gained a great deal from Nick’s personalized coaching techniques. Our one on one coaching sessions helped me understand that the most important thing that I can do in life is listen. Listen for the verbal, vocal and visual aspects of the communication process. Nick embedded the finer points of Emotional Intelligence and Neuro Linguistic Programming techniques that has enabled me to understand the true position of our employees and the business at large. People have the answers within them. It is up to my leadership team to listen and foster an environment of growth and success for them. Nick’s coaching has provided me with that opportunity and I am grateful to him Michael Staples. BSc. PEng. MBA. General Manager, K-Bro Linen We at Hammond Power Solutions have worked with Nick on several different occasions. His knowledge and expertise is second to none and as a result our salaried and hourly associates respect him and look forward to his training sessions. Larry Lichty, Director Human Resources Hammond Power Solutions I requested Nick for three mediation sessions in Calgary, Alberta. In all three sessions, he came into a rather tense situation filled with disintegration and anarchy. Nick engaged union and company officials in separate meetings and was able to facilitate a fabulous and productive conversation between all parties, resulting in three successful mediated solutions. He saved us a significant sum of money and was able to lay the foundation for better working relationships between all parties. We continue to use Nick’s talents on a regular basis. He did a wonderful job and is well respected in our company Geoff Smith. BA, CHRP, MBA. Director, Human Resources, St. Gobain Inc. The management and leadership services that Nick provided enabled my team to build the foundation that was required to help them advance to the next level of performance excellence. Nick has the unique and unmatched ability to make people feel comfortable and create an open, risk free environment where you felt free to explore real life situations. It was great to see my team so positively energized by the whole experience Robert Torresin Operations Manager. Milacron International – North American Operations. A very pleasant and out going gentleman, Nick coached me through some very turbulent times and instilled the confidence and courage that I needed to make some very difficult decisions. His coaching techniques were straight and to the point and always left me options. In a directive approach Nick was able to remove roadblocks to optimal work performance and the decisions that were made enabled our business unit to thrive in an atmosphere of uncertainty Justine Henhawk – Bomberry.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

Michelle Ock Manager, Organizational Development Toronto Hydro Electric System Nick is a skilled facilitator. Over our three day period, he was able to capture and maintain the attention and participation levels of the entire group. Nick offered practical solutions that were relevant to todays managers. My time with Nick was a great experience. Kathryn Weidhass Manager, Human Resources – Employee Relations, City of Waterloo Nick was a great facilatator. I waited for almost a year to attend one of his public courses. He was everything my coworkers said he was. He gave us many opportunities to participate and everyone did. After leaving I felt full and complete. Absolutely loved Nick’s examples of the good, bad and ugly management practices that he has experienced. Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days. It really challenged me in a large part and this can only attributed to your skillful facilitating skills. Illustrating the various behavioural types that we may or may not encounter has enabled me to be a more confident and courageous leader. I wish I had additional time to glean more knowledge from your vast experiences and knowledge, I seemed to be soaking it up like a sponge and just wanted more and more. Keep up the great work and enthusiasm, I will definitely look for additional training where you are the facilitator. Chris Callaghan, C.Tech. Peterborough Utilities Services Inc.

All of our team members have been and continue to be extremely satisfied with the quality and depth of training and follow up that Nick provides. I highly recommend engaging Nick’s expertise. Fabrizio Gagliardo Manager, Talent Acquisition & Development, Ferrero Canada Nick is a very engaging and highly skilled facilitator who made a lasting impression on our managers. We contacted Nick late in the game and he came prepared. With very little notice he provided our new managers with up to date training filled with hands on learning and real life experiences. Nick operations and business background was so solid that he could relate to our managers and the challenges they face. We are bringing Nick back to do the same training for another set of managers and hiring him to develop a specialized program that will build on concepts learned in this initial training. Laura Fitzsimmons Strategic HR Business Advisor. Ontario Clean Water Agency. Nick is an experienced high skilled facilitator and trainer who relates well to people and their workplace challenges. He is able to put issues in perspective and address challenges with intelligence and wisdom. His knowledge and experience show through with some of our most closed minded – too old to change leaders.

Nick will build cohesion with your group that can take some years to do and he does it with a sense of class that is second to none. Peter Ayers Plant Manager, Belden Incorporated I just wanted to comment on the absolutely outstanding job the facilitator Nick Pollice did with the Leadership session the past two days. My expectations were more than met with his methods and delivery. I look forward for the opportunity to attend further programs if Nick would once again be the facilitator. He was top notch; excellent sourcing for the City of Kitchener. City of Kitchener Employee I gained a great deal from Nick’s personalized coaching techniques. Our one on one coaching sessions helped me understand that the most important thing that I can do in life is listen. Listen for the verbal, vocal and visual aspects of the communication process.

Larry Lichty, Director Human Resources Hammond Power Solutions I requested Nick for three mediation sessions in Calgary, Alberta. In all three sessions, he came into a rather tense situation filled with disintegration and anarchy. Nick engaged union and company officials in separate meetings and was able to facilitate a fabulous and productive conversation between all parties, resulting in three successful mediated solutions. He saved us a significant sum of money and was able to lay the foundation for better working relationships between all parties. We continue to use Nick’s talents on a regular basis.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

Michelle Ock Manager, Organizational Development Toronto Hydro Electric System Nick is a skilled facilitator. Over our three day period, he was able to capture and maintain the attention and participation levels of the entire group. Nick offered practical solutions that were relevant to todays managers. My time with Nick was a great experience. Kathryn Weidhass Manager, Human Resources – Employee Relations, City of Waterloo Nick was a great facilatator. I waited for almost a year to attend one of his public courses. He was everything my coworkers said he was. He gave us many opportunities to participate and everyone did. After leaving I felt full and complete. Absolutely loved Nick’s examples of the good, bad and ugly management practices that he has experienced. Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days. It really challenged me in a large part and this can only attributed to your skillful facilitating skills. Illustrating the various behavioural types that we may or may not encounter has enabled me to be a more confident and courageous leader. I wish I had additional time to glean more knowledge from your vast experiences and knowledge, I seemed to be soaking it up like a sponge and just wanted more and more. Keep up the great work and enthusiasm, I will definitely look for additional training where you are the facilitator. Chris Callaghan, C.Tech. Peterborough Utilities Services Inc.

Fabrizio Gagliardo Manager, Talent Acquisition & Development, Ferrero Canada Nick is a very engaging and highly skilled facilitator who made a lasting impression on our managers. We contacted Nick late in the game and he came prepared. With very little notice he provided our new managers with up to date training filled with hands on learning and real life experiences. Nick operations and business background was so solid that he could relate to our managers and the challenges they face. We are bringing Nick back to do the same training for another set of managers and hiring him to develop a specialized program that will build on concepts learned in this initial training. Laura Fitzsimmons Strategic HR Business Advisor. Ontario Clean Water Agency. Nick is an experienced high skilled facilitator and trainer who relates well to people and their workplace challenges.

704304,20210813,pollicemanagement.com,https://pollicemanagement.com/strategic-planning/,text/html,text/html,en,"Strategic Planning | Pollice Management Group 905.517.0193 nick@pollicemanagement.com Home Who we are Nick’s Bio Community What We Do Public Appearances Our Clients Articles Media Contact Select Page Strategic Planning Strategic Planning Jul 1, 2021 | Planning Most companies invest a significant amount of time and effort in a formal annual strategic planning process however, many executives see little benefit from the investment. Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

My time with Nick was a great experience. Kathryn Weidhass Manager, Human Resources – Employee Relations, City of Waterloo Nick was a great facilatator. I waited for almost a year to attend one of his public courses. He was everything my coworkers said he was. He gave us many opportunities to participate and everyone did.

Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days. It really challenged me in a large part and this can only attributed to your skillful facilitating skills.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

WHAT SHOULD LEADERS BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD? Sep 1, 2021 | Uncategorized Businesses will continue to struggle in order to grasp and understand which of the Covid 19 pandemic’s effects will be temporary and which will become permanent. Four new reports attempt to analyze these longer term trends. One is from Glassdoor in California; a website and information hub that allows employees to rank their employers. Another is a global management consulting agency in Massachusetts called the Boston Group which endeavours to provide strategic planning initiatives; McKinsey Global in Toronto which provides readers with a terrific insight to management challenges and the Chartered Management Institute in the United Kingdom which regulates Managers was also included. When read together, their message is clear – firms stand to benefit from the pandemic however, managerial life is going to dramatically change by getting a little more difficult. One change that is certain to last is employees working from home. McKinsey Global finds that 24 % of all Canadian workers surveyed wanted to work from home, 69 % would like to work at least three days a week from home and 7% desired to go back to the office full time. With organizations willing to accept such numbers for the most part perhaps, working from home has not dented productivity to the extent that many of us thought it would and some organizations have said productivity has improved in their areas. Flexible work schedules can be a frugal way of retaining talented employees who have child care or home responsibilities or, would just like to work from home in an introverted fashion due to preference or convenience. Offering potential cost savings, telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular among organizations. There is not only the reduction in office space leasing; there are other large potential cost savings elsewhere. Remote employees do not need to live in big cities where property is expensive. If employees live in cheaper places companies need not pay them as much. Glassdoor estimates that employees who leave San Francisco will eventually face salary reductions of 25 %; those leaving New York may lose 20 % and those in Toronto can easily expect a salary reduction of 10 %. As the reports point out, remote employees are in essence competing with a global workforce and are in a weaker bargaining position. Remember, this is just salary reductions; we haven’t begun to speak about bonuses, perks or benefits. These can add an additional 17 % reduction to the mix. This point is reinforced by the Boston Group survey which illustrates the pandemic has increased the willingness of organizations to work with freelancers and / or contract employees on a regular basis. Previously, many managers worried about legal and compliance issues associated with such options. This in turn prevented managers from using outside staff. Currently, in light of the pandemic – organizations have adjusted their operational and tactical business models that has lead to an abundance of talented outsiders acting as full time employees. Some pundits believe that this flexibility will lead to operational speeds that deliver quicker results and be more efficient on strategy. Despite remote workforce advantages there are a number of challenges that managers must deal with as the Chartered Management Institute points out. The Institute surveyed 2,300 managers and employees and the results underscored just how important effective communication and concern for employee well being is to good management practices. There is an interesting difference of perspective from an employee and management view. Nearly 61 % of all managers surveyed thought they were engaging employees in the decision making process since March of 2020 but, only 24 % of the employees agreed. The survey also illustrated that the experience of remote working hasn’t been uniform. Of those working virtual, 69 % of women with children wanted to work at least one day per week at home when the pandemic ends compared with 54 % of men with children. The reason that women gave was that they had little contact with their managers during the lockdown in comparison to men; which suggests that they may have been neglected. Also, 42 % of all North American employees from minority ethnic backgrounds thought that the workplace culture had got better during the crisis. Such a result would indicate that something was wrong with office culture beforehand. The Institute survey also found that black employees were more likely than any other ethnic group to feel that their managers did not trust them to undertake their role. So, managers might have a significant amount of work to do in order to build bridges with some of their employees. From a managerial standpoint, organizations may need to tailor their behaviour to individual employee needs. Although some organizations may have been concerned that remote working would lead to employees “slacking off”; it may appear that organizational leaders may have lost their way. Time spent on video conferencing has resulted in time taken away from speaking directly with employees. In a world of remote working, employees may stress the need for better communication with them. The future emphasis may not only be on “management by walking around”, it may also be on “management by dialing and zooming around”. A study by Burning Glass, a labour market analytics firm located in Boston, Massachusetts finds that thanks to remote work, more employees will have more flexibility over when, where and how they earn a living. Leaders will be indifferent as to whether their employees are working in Chicago or Montreal. The shift to a hybrid model of work, with some employees working in an office while others work from home is already taking shape. It is forcing managers to become much better communicators, thought provokers and stimulators in changing employment law and addressing perceived inequities. About The Author.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

WHAT SHOULD LEADERS BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD? Sep 1, 2021 | Uncategorized Businesses will continue to struggle in order to grasp and understand which of the Covid 19 pandemic’s effects will be temporary and which will become permanent. Four new reports attempt to analyze these longer term trends. One is from Glassdoor in California; a website and information hub that allows employees to rank their employers. Another is a global management consulting agency in Massachusetts called the Boston Group which endeavours to provide strategic planning initiatives; McKinsey Global in Toronto which provides readers with a terrific insight to management challenges and the Chartered Management Institute in the United Kingdom which regulates Managers was also included. When read together, their message is clear – firms stand to benefit from the pandemic however, managerial life is going to dramatically change by getting a little more difficult. One change that is certain to last is employees working from home. McKinsey Global finds that 24 % of all Canadian workers surveyed wanted to work from home, 69 % would like to work at least three days a week from home and 7% desired to go back to the office full time. With organizations willing to accept such numbers for the most part perhaps, working from home has not dented productivity to the extent that many of us thought it would and some organizations have said productivity has improved in their areas. Flexible work schedules can be a frugal way of retaining talented employees who have child care or home responsibilities or, would just like to work from home in an introverted fashion due to preference or convenience. Offering potential cost savings, telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular among organizations. There is not only the reduction in office space leasing; there are other large potential cost savings elsewhere. Remote employees do not need to live in big cities where property is expensive. If employees live in cheaper places companies need not pay them as much. Glassdoor estimates that employees who leave San Francisco will eventually face salary reductions of 25 %; those leaving New York may lose 20 % and those in Toronto can easily expect a salary reduction of 10 %. As the reports point out, remote employees are in essence competing with a global workforce and are in a weaker bargaining position. Remember, this is just salary reductions; we haven’t begun to speak about bonuses, perks or benefits. These can add an additional 17 % reduction to the mix. This point is reinforced by the Boston Group survey which illustrates the pandemic has increased the willingness of organizations to work with freelancers and / or contract employees on a regular basis. Previously, many managers worried about legal and compliance issues associated with such options. This in turn prevented managers from using outside staff. Currently, in light of the pandemic – organizations have adjusted their operational and tactical business models that has lead to an abundance of talented outsiders acting as full time employees. Some pundits believe that this flexibility will lead to operational speeds that deliver quicker results and be more efficient on strategy. Despite remote workforce advantages there are a number of challenges that managers must deal with as the Chartered Management Institute points out. The Institute surveyed 2,300 managers and employees and the results underscored just how important effective communication and concern for employee well being is to good management practices. There is an interesting difference of perspective from an employee and management view. Nearly 61 % of all managers surveyed thought they were engaging employees in the decision making process since March of 2020 but, only 24 % of the employees agreed. The survey also illustrated that the experience of remote working hasn’t been uniform. Of those working virtual, 69 % of women with children wanted to work at least one day per week at home when the pandemic ends compared with 54 % of men with children. The reason that women gave was that they had little contact with their managers during the lockdown in comparison to men; which suggests that they may have been neglected. Also, 42 % of all North American employees from minority ethnic backgrounds thought that the workplace culture had got better during the crisis. Such a result would indicate that something was wrong with office culture beforehand. The Institute survey also found that black employees were more likely than any other ethnic group to feel that their managers did not trust them to undertake their role. So, managers might have a significant amount of work to do in order to build bridges with some of their employees. From a managerial standpoint, organizations may need to tailor their behaviour to individual employee needs. Although some organizations may have been concerned that remote working would lead to employees “slacking off”; it may appear that organizational leaders may have lost their way. Time spent on video conferencing has resulted in time taken away from speaking directly with employees. In a world of remote working, employees may stress the need for better communication with them. The future emphasis may not only be on “management by walking around”, it may also be on “management by dialing and zooming around”. A study by Burning Glass, a labour market analytics firm located in Boston, Massachusetts finds that thanks to remote work, more employees will have more flexibility over when, where and how they earn a living. Leaders will be indifferent as to whether their employees are working in Chicago or Montreal. The shift to a hybrid model of work, with some employees working in an office while others work from home is already taking shape. It is forcing managers to become much better communicators, thought provokers and stimulators in changing employment law and addressing perceived inequities. About The Author.

Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan.

Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

Michelle Ock Manager, Organizational Development Toronto Hydro Electric System Nick is a skilled facilitator. Over our three day period, he was able to capture and maintain the attention and participation levels of the entire group. Nick offered practical solutions that were relevant to todays managers. My time with Nick was a great experience. Kathryn Weidhass Manager, Human Resources – Employee Relations, City of Waterloo Nick was a great facilatator. I waited for almost a year to attend one of his public courses. He was everything my coworkers said he was. He gave us many opportunities to participate and everyone did. After leaving I felt full and complete. Absolutely loved Nick’s examples of the good, bad and ugly management practices that he has experienced. Nick allowed for great discussion points, wonderfully informative. Dina Sokkar National Credit Manager, Continental Tire Canada Inc. Nick is a very affable person. He engaged our Six Nations Elected Council in the facilitation of a Strategic & Operational Plan. Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days. It really challenged me in a large part and this can only attributed to your skillful facilitating skills. Illustrating the various behavioural types that we may or may not encounter has enabled me to be a more confident and courageous leader. I wish I had additional time to glean more knowledge from your vast experiences and knowledge, I seemed to be soaking it up like a sponge and just wanted more and more. Keep up the great work and enthusiasm, I will definitely look for additional training where you are the facilitator. Chris Callaghan, C.Tech. Peterborough Utilities Services Inc.

Fabrizio Gagliardo Manager, Talent Acquisition & Development, Ferrero Canada Nick is a very engaging and highly skilled facilitator who made a lasting impression on our managers. We contacted Nick late in the game and he came prepared. With very little notice he provided our new managers with up to date training filled with hands on learning and real life experiences. Nick operations and business background was so solid that he could relate to our managers and the challenges they face. We are bringing Nick back to do the same training for another set of managers and hiring him to develop a specialized program that will build on concepts learned in this initial training.

Peter Ayers Plant Manager, Belden Incorporated I just wanted to comment on the absolutely outstanding job the facilitator Nick Pollice did with the Leadership session the past two days.

He was top notch; excellent sourcing for the City of Kitchener. City of Kitchener Employee I gained a great deal from Nick’s personalized coaching techniques.

735361,20210917,pollicemanagement.com,https://pollicemanagement.com/strategic-planning/,text/html,text/html,en,"Strategic Planning | Pollice Management Group 905.517.0193 nick@pollicemanagement.com Home Who we are Nick’s Bio Community What We Do Public Appearances Our Clients Articles Media Contact Select Page Strategic Planning Strategic Planning Jul 1, 2021 | Planning Most companies invest a significant amount of time and effort in a formal annual strategic planning process however, many executives see little benefit from the investment. Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

WHAT SHOULD LEADERS BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD? Sep 1, 2021 | Uncategorized Businesses will continue to struggle in order to grasp and understand which of the Covid 19 pandemic’s effects will be temporary and which will become permanent. Four new reports attempt to analyze these longer term trends. One is from Glassdoor in California; a website and information hub that allows employees to rank their employers. Another is a global management consulting agency in Massachusetts called the Boston Group which endeavours to provide strategic planning initiatives; McKinsey Global in Toronto which provides readers with a terrific insight to management challenges and the Chartered Management Institute in the United Kingdom which regulates Managers was also included. When read together, their message is clear – firms stand to benefit from the pandemic however, managerial life is going to dramatically change by getting a little more difficult. One change that is certain to last is employees working from home. McKinsey Global finds that 24 % of all Canadian workers surveyed wanted to work from home, 69 % would like to work at least three days a week from home and 7% desired to go back to the office full time. With organizations willing to accept such numbers for the most part perhaps, working from home has not dented productivity to the extent that many of us thought it would and some organizations have said productivity has improved in their areas. Flexible work schedules can be a frugal way of retaining talented employees who have child care or home responsibilities or, would just like to work from home in an introverted fashion due to preference or convenience. Offering potential cost savings, telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular among organizations. There is not only the reduction in office space leasing; there are other large potential cost savings elsewhere. Remote employees do not need to live in big cities where property is expensive. If employees live in cheaper places companies need not pay them as much. Glassdoor estimates that employees who leave San Francisco will eventually face salary reductions of 25 %; those leaving New York may lose 20 % and those in Toronto can easily expect a salary reduction of 10 %. As the reports point out, remote employees are in essence competing with a global workforce and are in a weaker bargaining position. Remember, this is just salary reductions; we haven’t begun to speak about bonuses, perks or benefits. These can add an additional 17 % reduction to the mix. This point is reinforced by the Boston Group survey which illustrates the pandemic has increased the willingness of organizations to work with freelancers and / or contract employees on a regular basis. Previously, many managers worried about legal and compliance issues associated with such options. This in turn prevented managers from using outside staff. Currently, in light of the pandemic – organizations have adjusted their operational and tactical business models that has lead to an abundance of talented outsiders acting as full time employees. Some pundits believe that this flexibility will lead to operational speeds that deliver quicker results and be more efficient on strategy. Despite remote workforce advantages there are a number of challenges that managers must deal with as the Chartered Management Institute points out. The Institute surveyed 2,300 managers and employees and the results underscored just how important effective communication and concern for employee well being is to good management practices. There is an interesting difference of perspective from an employee and management view. Nearly 61 % of all managers surveyed thought they were engaging employees in the decision making process since March of 2020 but, only 24 % of the employees agreed. The survey also illustrated that the experience of remote working hasn’t been uniform. Of those working virtual, 69 % of women with children wanted to work at least one day per week at home when the pandemic ends compared with 54 % of men with children. The reason that women gave was that they had little contact with their managers during the lockdown in comparison to men; which suggests that they may have been neglected. Also, 42 % of all North American employees from minority ethnic backgrounds thought that the workplace culture had got better during the crisis. Such a result would indicate that something was wrong with office culture beforehand. The Institute survey also found that black employees were more likely than any other ethnic group to feel that their managers did not trust them to undertake their role. So, managers might have a significant amount of work to do in order to build bridges with some of their employees. From a managerial standpoint, organizations may need to tailor their behaviour to individual employee needs. Although some organizations may have been concerned that remote working would lead to employees “slacking off”; it may appear that organizational leaders may have lost their way. Time spent on video conferencing has resulted in time taken away from speaking directly with employees. In a world of remote working, employees may stress the need for better communication with them. The future emphasis may not only be on “management by walking around”, it may also be on “management by dialing and zooming around”. A study by Burning Glass, a labour market analytics firm located in Boston, Massachusetts finds that thanks to remote work, more employees will have more flexibility over when, where and how they earn a living. Leaders will be indifferent as to whether their employees are working in Chicago or Montreal. The shift to a hybrid model of work, with some employees working in an office while others work from home is already taking shape. It is forcing managers to become much better communicators, thought provokers and stimulators in changing employment law and addressing perceived inequities. About The Author.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

WHAT SHOULD LEADERS BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD? Sep 1, 2021 | Uncategorized Businesses will continue to struggle in order to grasp and understand which of the Covid 19 pandemic’s effects will be temporary and which will become permanent. Four new reports attempt to analyze these longer term trends. One is from Glassdoor in California; a website and information hub that allows employees to rank their employers. Another is a global management consulting agency in Massachusetts called the Boston Group which endeavours to provide strategic planning initiatives; McKinsey Global in Toronto which provides readers with a terrific insight to management challenges and the Chartered Management Institute in the United Kingdom which regulates Managers was also included. When read together, their message is clear – firms stand to benefit from the pandemic however, managerial life is going to dramatically change by getting a little more difficult. One change that is certain to last is employees working from home. McKinsey Global finds that 24 % of all Canadian workers surveyed wanted to work from home, 69 % would like to work at least three days a week from home and 7% desired to go back to the office full time. With organizations willing to accept such numbers for the most part perhaps, working from home has not dented productivity to the extent that many of us thought it would and some organizations have said productivity has improved in their areas. Flexible work schedules can be a frugal way of retaining talented employees who have child care or home responsibilities or, would just like to work from home in an introverted fashion due to preference or convenience. Offering potential cost savings, telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular among organizations. There is not only the reduction in office space leasing; there are other large potential cost savings elsewhere. Remote employees do not need to live in big cities where property is expensive. If employees live in cheaper places companies need not pay them as much. Glassdoor estimates that employees who leave San Francisco will eventually face salary reductions of 25 %; those leaving New York may lose 20 % and those in Toronto can easily expect a salary reduction of 10 %. As the reports point out, remote employees are in essence competing with a global workforce and are in a weaker bargaining position. Remember, this is just salary reductions; we haven’t begun to speak about bonuses, perks or benefits. These can add an additional 17 % reduction to the mix. This point is reinforced by the Boston Group survey which illustrates the pandemic has increased the willingness of organizations to work with freelancers and / or contract employees on a regular basis. Previously, many managers worried about legal and compliance issues associated with such options. This in turn prevented managers from using outside staff. Currently, in light of the pandemic – organizations have adjusted their operational and tactical business models that has lead to an abundance of talented outsiders acting as full time employees. Some pundits believe that this flexibility will lead to operational speeds that deliver quicker results and be more efficient on strategy. Despite remote workforce advantages there are a number of challenges that managers must deal with as the Chartered Management Institute points out. The Institute surveyed 2,300 managers and employees and the results underscored just how important effective communication and concern for employee well being is to good management practices. There is an interesting difference of perspective from an employee and management view. Nearly 61 % of all managers surveyed thought they were engaging employees in the decision making process since March of 2020 but, only 24 % of the employees agreed. The survey also illustrated that the experience of remote working hasn’t been uniform. Of those working virtual, 69 % of women with children wanted to work at least one day per week at home when the pandemic ends compared with 54 % of men with children. The reason that women gave was that they had little contact with their managers during the lockdown in comparison to men; which suggests that they may have been neglected. Also, 42 % of all North American employees from minority ethnic backgrounds thought that the workplace culture had got better during the crisis. Such a result would indicate that something was wrong with office culture beforehand. The Institute survey also found that black employees were more likely than any other ethnic group to feel that their managers did not trust them to undertake their role. So, managers might have a significant amount of work to do in order to build bridges with some of their employees. From a managerial standpoint, organizations may need to tailor their behaviour to individual employee needs. Although some organizations may have been concerned that remote working would lead to employees “slacking off”; it may appear that organizational leaders may have lost their way. Time spent on video conferencing has resulted in time taken away from speaking directly with employees. In a world of remote working, employees may stress the need for better communication with them. The future emphasis may not only be on “management by walking around”, it may also be on “management by dialing and zooming around”. A study by Burning Glass, a labour market analytics firm located in Boston, Massachusetts finds that thanks to remote work, more employees will have more flexibility over when, where and how they earn a living. Leaders will be indifferent as to whether their employees are working in Chicago or Montreal. The shift to a hybrid model of work, with some employees working in an office while others work from home is already taking shape. It is forcing managers to become much better communicators, thought provokers and stimulators in changing employment law and addressing perceived inequities. About The Author.

Although at times Councillors had their own agenda, Nick professionally confronted the challenges, engaged our Council in productive conversation and ensured that all of our Councillors were able to work in a safe effective environment. Our Council was able to achieve the aggressive results that we had planned under Nick’s direction. I know of very few consultants that could have delivered results in accordance to our high expectations. Nick continues to work with several of our business units throughout the Six Nations Community because of his ability to get results and the high degree of trust that we have in him. Ava Hill Chief, Elected Council of the Six Nations of the Grand River Nick, I just wanted to say thank you so much for the Communication Course work over the past few days. It really challenged me in a large part and this can only attributed to your skillful facilitating skills. Illustrating the various behavioural types that we may or may not encounter has enabled me to be a more confident and courageous leader. I wish I had additional time to glean more knowledge from your vast experiences and knowledge, I seemed to be soaking it up like a sponge and just wanted more and more.

Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

WHAT SHOULD LEADERS BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD? Sep 1, 2021 | Uncategorized Businesses will continue to struggle in order to grasp and understand which of the Covid 19 pandemic’s effects will be temporary and which will become permanent. Four new reports attempt to analyze these longer term trends. One is from Glassdoor in California; a website and information hub that allows employees to rank their employers. Another is a global management consulting agency in Massachusetts called the Boston Group which endeavours to provide strategic planning initiatives; McKinsey Global in Toronto which provides readers with a terrific insight to management challenges and the Chartered Management Institute in the United Kingdom which regulates Managers was also included. When read together, their message is clear – firms stand to benefit from the pandemic however, managerial life is going to dramatically change by getting a little more difficult. One change that is certain to last is employees working from home. McKinsey Global finds that 24 % of all Canadian workers surveyed wanted to work from home, 69 % would like to work at least three days a week from home and 7% desired to go back to the office full time. With organizations willing to accept such numbers for the most part perhaps, working from home has not dented productivity to the extent that many of us thought it would and some organizations have said productivity has improved in their areas. Flexible work schedules can be a frugal way of retaining talented employees who have child care or home responsibilities or, would just like to work from home in an introverted fashion due to preference or convenience. Offering potential cost savings, telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular among organizations. There is not only the reduction in office space leasing; there are other large potential cost savings elsewhere. Remote employees do not need to live in big cities where property is expensive. If employees live in cheaper places companies need not pay them as much. Glassdoor estimates that employees who leave San Francisco will eventually face salary reductions of 25 %; those leaving New York may lose 20 % and those in Toronto can easily expect a salary reduction of 10 %. As the reports point out, remote employees are in essence competing with a global workforce and are in a weaker bargaining position. Remember, this is just salary reductions; we haven’t begun to speak about bonuses, perks or benefits. These can add an additional 17 % reduction to the mix. This point is reinforced by the Boston Group survey which illustrates the pandemic has increased the willingness of organizations to work with freelancers and / or contract employees on a regular basis. Previously, many managers worried about legal and compliance issues associated with such options. This in turn prevented managers from using outside staff. Currently, in light of the pandemic – organizations have adjusted their operational and tactical business models that has lead to an abundance of talented outsiders acting as full time employees. Some pundits believe that this flexibility will lead to operational speeds that deliver quicker results and be more efficient on strategy. Despite remote workforce advantages there are a number of challenges that managers must deal with as the Chartered Management Institute points out. The Institute surveyed 2,300 managers and employees and the results underscored just how important effective communication and concern for employee well being is to good management practices. There is an interesting difference of perspective from an employee and management view. Nearly 61 % of all managers surveyed thought they were engaging employees in the decision making process since March of 2020 but, only 24 % of the employees agreed. The survey also illustrated that the experience of remote working hasn’t been uniform. Of those working virtual, 69 % of women with children wanted to work at least one day per week at home when the pandemic ends compared with 54 % of men with children. The reason that women gave was that they had little contact with their managers during the lockdown in comparison to men; which suggests that they may have been neglected. Also, 42 % of all North American employees from minority ethnic backgrounds thought that the workplace culture had got better during the crisis. Such a result would indicate that something was wrong with office culture beforehand. The Institute survey also found that black employees were more likely than any other ethnic group to feel that their managers did not trust them to undertake their role. So, managers might have a significant amount of work to do in order to build bridges with some of their employees. From a managerial standpoint, organizations may need to tailor their behaviour to individual employee needs. Although some organizations may have been concerned that remote working would lead to employees “slacking off”; it may appear that organizational leaders may have lost their way. Time spent on video conferencing has resulted in time taken away from speaking directly with employees. In a world of remote working, employees may stress the need for better communication with them. The future emphasis may not only be on “management by walking around”, it may also be on “management by dialing and zooming around”. A study by Burning Glass, a labour market analytics firm located in Boston, Massachusetts finds that thanks to remote work, more employees will have more flexibility over when, where and how they earn a living. Leaders will be indifferent as to whether their employees are working in Chicago or Montreal. The shift to a hybrid model of work, with some employees working in an office while others work from home is already taking shape. It is forcing managers to become much better communicators, thought provokers and stimulators in changing employment law and addressing perceived inequities. About The Author.

WHERE HAS ALL THE TALENT GONE? Oct 1, 2021 | The Workplace In another drastic reminder as to how the labour market has become so distorted, the number of job openings in the USA hit an all time hire of 10.1 million in July and the Canadian job market experienced 1.2 million job openings in that same period of time. As the North American economy begins to rebound, even as the Delta Variant of Covid is spreading in poorly vaccinated parts of the continent – businesses are scrambling to add employees. Manufacturing jobs beginning at entry level through to supervisory positions are all in play. Fork Lift Truck Operators, Quality Assurance Technicians, skill trades such as Welders, Electronic Process Control Technicians, Electricians, Gas Fitters and Plumbers are all in great demand. Add to this Advanced Medical Technologists, Manufacturing Technologists and Assembly personnel we have the perfect storm. At no time since 1944 have we seen such a demand. Even Global Affairs Canada reports that clerical positions are available at a starting salary of $ 1,100 per week. Employee shortages in Canada are not really a new challenge for employers however, the landscape in which the competition for talent is taking place is very different. This is in part due to a strong demand for employees generated by robust economic growth, employees who have used the pandemic as an stimulus to alter their careers and potential employees who have decided to start up their own companies. Completing the perfect storm scenario is the fact that employees today are more informed about the world surrounding them and where they fit, a demand for a better working environment, alternative opportunities, a reconfigured employee market, employees who value their worth and corporate failure to hire during recessionary times. Although unemployment will remain around 5 % in 2022 for many unskilled employees, for several companies a shortage of workers with the skills they need will become a severe problem. Several manpower surveys have found that 34% of employers worldwide are having challenges filling jobs with technicians, salespeople, skilled-trades workers and technologists. Adding to the corporate dilemma is the prediction that the North American economy will grow by 7 % in 2022, meaning these numbers may be higher. Companies will need to become more inventive if they are to recruit and motivate the people they need. Competition will be most intense for the very best talent, as more employers accept the verdict of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, that an exceptional employee is “not just a little better than someone who is pretty good; they are 100 times better.” Again, I have stated in previous publications; the fight for talent will be as fierce in emerging economies, where locals with the ability to thrive in global markets will be targeted by both foreign multinationals and domestic firms with ambitions abroad. Compensation will remain the heavy artillery in the corporate arsenal. Wages in the 70 % – 80 % percentile are now the norm and will need to be supplemented with an enriched employee benefit plan, the casual ability to work from home, attendance and punctuality bonuses, subsidized child care, mental health days, a minimum of four weeks vacation and a four day work week. Overtime after 35 hours is also in play for prospective employees. Jack Kelly, founder and CEO of the Compliance Search Group says that organizations have been buying, building and / or rehabbing office spaces to make them more attractive and appealing to employees. These amenities are meant to entice people to get out of their homes and come into the office three days a week because they are more opulent than their homes. The Canadian economy is set for a hiring boom in the months ahead and the signs are already under way. In light of the sudden need for talent, employees and job seekers will have the upper hand. All potential candidates will be able to find three times more jobs than before COVID . Hiring leaders will need to roll out the red carpet and concede to demands of those prospects and companies know that if they don’t appease the job applicants, they will go elsewhere as there will be more opportunities on the horizon. Canadian financial institution executives have put plans in place to attract and retain the best talent they can get. They conducted a survey that found one in three employees do not want to work on site full time, are desirous of flexible work schedules and are looking for a four day work week. They have crafted plans to fit these demands as the war for talent is starting. Numerous Canadian survey results have shown that employees have divided the benefits of working for perspective employers into two categories; they are the Prime Movers and the Secondary Movers. The Prime Movers are those elements that employees require before saying yes to a job. Some manpower experts refer to these elements as the absolutes. They include, excellent employee benefits, work flexibility, 80th percentile wages, vacation starting at four weeks, monthly mental health days, being treated with respect, 40 hours of professional development per year and working in a team environment. Secondary Movers are those elements that employees find intriguing because they arouse interest in wanting to pursue further opportunities for employment with your organization. Secondary Movers include; overtime after 40 hours, attendance and punctuality bonus, subsidized child care, four day work week and spruced up / rehabbed office space. Summary: Organizations deliberate over strategies to capture new markets and clients, now they’ll need to define a multi pronged market strategy for top talent by thinking beyond when it comes to packaging an offer. Employees are looking for the intangibles; flexible work schedules, training opportunities, meaningful work and leadership professionalism. Remote work is already proving to be a powerful motivator for talent and it allows organizations to tap into a wider pool of talent. Many employees value the flexibility of working from home along with a greater sense of control of time. Besides evolving work arrangements, reward / compensation packages may need to be revisited in order to align with the rapidly changing business opportunities and priorities. Although organizations have acknowledged the pandemic had a considerable impact on their business, less than 30 % have reviewed or are in the process of reviewing their compensation packages. This may turn out to be a serious alignment risk to the business because, it assumes that what worked pre Covid will work post Covid and that is not the reality. About The Author.

752948,20211008,pollicemanagement.com,https://pollicemanagement.com/strategic-planning/,text/html,text/html,en,"Strategic Planning | Pollice Management Group 905.517.0193 nick@pollicemanagement.com Home Who we are Nick’s Bio Community What We Do Public Appearances Our Clients Articles Media Contact Select Page Strategic Planning Strategic Planning Jul 1, 2021 | Planning Most companies invest a significant amount of time and effort in a formal annual strategic planning process however, many executives see little benefit from the investment. Professor Roger Martin (former Dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto) said it so distinctly when he said; “there is no doubt that corporate leaders know that strategy is important. Some even find it scary and intimidating because it forces them to confront a future that is undefined and can only be guessed at. Making matters worse is the fact that strategy entails making decisions that explicitly cut off possibilities and options to other elements. The natural reaction in this process is to make strategy planning less daunting by turning the process into a problem that can be solved with tried and tested tools and techniques that offer predictability and make the task less scary.” Strategic planning is about navigating the road ahead. It’s a carefully crafted plan or method for achieving specific goals over a period of time. It involves business strategy, operational strategies and quite possibly a transformational strategy. For strategy to have a chance of success, it must be “baked” into the products and / or services that a company provides. This may involve communication plans, marketing plans, people plans, process improvement plans, budget plans and operational plans. One senior executive member told me that, “our planning process is like a ritual; there is a lot of movement, waving of flags and banners, singing and hand holding. No one is exactly sure why we do it but, there is an almost mystical hope that something good will come out of it.” Another said, “it’s like the old communist system. We pretend to make strategy and they pretend to follow it.” Setting The Direction: Strategic planning is the process of establishing, documenting and communicating a business direction by evaluating where the business is now, where it needs to be and how you’re going to get it there. It involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials, and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. A well written strategic plan can pay large dividends in business growth and success because it reveals to all parties how best to embrace opportunities while addressing challenges. This may be crucial to small business owners because the process of looking ahead can lead to meaningful changes in business planning by setting realistic future goals. Strategic planning is a communication process that ought to involve key employees. After all, these employees are involved in the daily operations of the organization and can provide a unique insight as to how the organizational functions on a day to day basis. In addition, some organizations like Martinrea International* reach out to people outside the organization like vendors and customers to get their thoughts on how the business is performing in servicing their needs. By the end of the strategic planning process, all stakeholders ought to have a significant insight as to where the business is going and how it will get there. In addition, they ought to know what success looks like and how it will be measured. These discussions and planning in itself help place the business in the best possible position to succeed in the future. It forces all stakeholders to think outside of their comfort zone and ascertain future opportunities and challenges. * Martinrea International is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of light weight structures and propulsion systems that address the automotive industry’s current and future solutions. Misconceptions Relating To Strategic Planning: As a strategic planning facilitator and executive coach, I hear several misconceptions from my clients about strategic planning. From not having enough time, the fear of putting the organization on the wrong path to we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business; the variety of reasons are astonishing and hard to digest. The strategic planning process may seem to be a bit daunting at first however, when facilitated properly and understood by all participants it really isn’t that complicated at all. It does take time but, if the strategic planning process is a priority we will make time and the process does pay off when all stakeholders understand and work towards accomplishing the goals that were laid out at the start. As for putting the organization on the wrong path nothing can be further from the truth. The strategic planning process doesn’t begin with the strategic planning session, it begins much earlier in the process. When you as a leader talk to your people, vendors, customers, etc, that research and discussion influence the decisions and direction that is communicated in the strategic planning process. They aren’t based on assumptions; they’re based on facts – facts that are derived from internal and external sources. It’s all about communication, transparency and people involving people. This tactic will squelch our third misconception that, we really don’t want the employees, vendors or customers knowing our business. These people are your business and by not getting them involved you limit your future success. The Strategic Planning Process: As was mentioned previously, the strategic planning process involves a six step plan of defining and / or redefining the corporate vision and mission, reassessing values, setting strategic objectives, evaluating financials and creating a methodology for executing and focusing on initiatives. Corporate Vision: A vision statement serves as a clear guide for selecting the future course of the organization because it defines where the senior leadership of the company needs and wants to be in the future. In other words, it is a futuristic organizational state of mind. As some of my clients would say; “it is the North Star on the horizon.” Defining, redefining and gaining a 100 % commitment to the corporate vision is tantamount to the strategic planning process because it sets the tone and provides the basis for short and long term objectives that will ultimately define your organization. A good example of a well documented Vision Statement is that of Martinrea International: “making lives better by being the best supplier we can be in the products we make and services we provide” Corporate Mission: The Corporate Mission is a spin off of the Corporate Vision. If everyone in your organization has their own interpretation of the vision, it can lead to conflicting initiatives and counter productive strategies. A Corporate Mission statement prevents this from happening because it defines how the vision will be accomplished. It is the “HOW” and addresses the internal elements such as human capital and technologies while encompassing the external elements such as vendors, customers, investors and the community at large. Lets hitch – hike on Martinrea one last time by illustrating their mission statement and see how it supports their vision: Our Mission is to make people lives better by: delivering outstanding quality products and services to our customers. providing meaningful opportunity, job satisfaction and job security for our people. providing superior long term investment returns to our stakeholders. being positive contributors to our communities. Corporate Values: Corporate Values (also referred to as company values or core values) are the set of guiding principles and fundamental beliefs that help a leadership team and all constituents function together as a team and work toward a common business goal. These values are often referred to as organizational “drivers” and relate to business, employee, customer and vendor relationships as well as, company and stakeholder growth. Values are core elements to organization success and must be revisited, defined and redefined as the company and its environment change. Although this may be a very short visit (usually less than 60 minutes) in the strategic planning process, they serve as a catalyst to the process. Some examples of corporate values are: integrity, honesty, fairness, accountability and trustworthiness however; the definitions of such will be different depending on the corporate environment and the actions that we expect from our people when dealing with internal and external elements. Setting Measureable Strategic Objectives: Strategic objectives are specific measureable results that an organization, business unit and person needs to achieve within a time frame that is imperative to corporate success. In my experience, 40 % of your strategic planning time will be consumed at this step. Although strategic plans may look out 3 – 5 years, given our current pandemic environment, it is recommended that these be divided into two categories; short term (3 to 12 months) and long term (12 – 24 months) for the time being. This allows all stakeholders to know if they are on the path of achieving their mission and vision. By clearly articulating objectives, organizations create benchmarks by which they can measure the overall health and impact of strategic initiatives. Strategic objectives can be financial and non financial and they are important to the strategic planning process because they drive priority setting, resource allocation, capability requirements and budgeting activities. It ought to be noted that the operative word here is “measureable”. Strategic objectives separate the players from the spectators as it has one underlying principle and that is accountability. Some examples of strategic objective might be: to exceed $ 10 million in net revenue in the next 18 months; to decrease operating expenses by 14 % by December 31, 2021; to decrease human capital by eight skilled positions September 1, 2022. Evaluating Financials: Strategic financial analysis is a powerful, value-creating framework that enables leaders to confidently assess strategy, analyze performance, and value a business. This empowers participants to make a range of business decisions, such as performing an in-depth competitive analysis in light of the company’s strategy. Financial statements can be used to track performance, budgets, and other metrics as tools and techniques to make decisions, motivate teams, and maintain a big-picture mindset. Conducting a strategic financial analysis needs to take place before the strategic planning process meeting on an individual business unit level should include: Compare your forecast to monthly actuals. Identify where your business unit is off track or exceeding projections. Review your income statement (profit and loss or P&L). Analyze your cash flow statement. Review your balance sheet. Creating a Methodology For Executing: Creating a methodology for executing the strategic planning process is a solid framework for addressing key challenges that will determine business unit tactics. The Conference Board of Canada reports that 60 % of all strategic plans fail due to poor execution. A number of my clients have told me that strategy execution is their number one concern when it comes to being successful. Creating an execution methodology is different for each organization because it is a systematic discipline process that exposes reality and acting on it. Three core principles are at the heart of execution; people, strategy and operations. Although organizations will see these core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Strengthening accountability for results, leaders acting like owners, strengthening accountability for behaviours and implementing a consist performance management system are the underlying factors that will shape organizational success in the execution process. Summary: Although organizations will see the aforementioned core principles differently due to the products and services provided as well as, their external environment; all will apply in the execution process. Successful strategic planning depends on educated, motivated and focused leadership. Leadership must make strategic planning a success priority, anything short of that mindset will result in failure. In the 1837 parable by Hans Christian Andersen, “The Emperor Has No Clothes”; the lesson learned is that when a leader surrounds themselves with “YES” people, it often leads to absurd and embarrassing results. It is far better to surround oneself with honest people, people who are not afraid to show their vulnerability, not afraid to ask questions and not afraid to point out deficiencies as they see them.

The Covid 19 aftermath, the raging war on attracting and retaining the right talent, the quest for better business practices, technological advances and client expectations – just to name a few; are placing tremendous pressure on businesses often to the extent of disruption and performance. Amid this turbulent and unstructured landscape is the fact that several employees are already burnt out, frustrated, disengaged, overworked and struggling for some sort of work life balance. All these factors are forcing businesses to take a fresh approach at how their people experience work. A 2021 Gallup pole research shows that 85 % of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work. That is an alarming statistic when you think that only 15 % of the world’s one billion employees are engaged at work. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity, slower economic growth and a downward spiral of human capital. Employee engagement is the extent to which employees feel passionate about their jobs, are committed to the organization, and put discretionary effort into their work. Employee engagement goes beyond activities, games, and events; employee engagement drives performance. When employees are engaged, they are more likely to invest in the work they do which leads to a higher quality of work produced. By investing in employee engagement, your company will be able to increase productivity, work quality, and retain top talent. “employee engagement cannot be a strategy because engagement comes from within the employee. Leaders cannot engage employees because engagement is an emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure organizational success”. Annette Franz. CEO, CX Journey Inc. For the sake of this publication, I have used the term strategy to signify the necessary steps that a leader can take in order to help an employee achieve a positive emotional connection to their work and the organization as a whole. Most leaders believe (and rightfully so) that a positive employee engagement leads to improved motivation, better job satisfaction, job enrichment, lower conversion costs and reduced non conformance costs. This belief was proven back in 1991 when the Ivey School of Business at Western University in London, Ontario introduced the Service – Profit Chain theory which traced business profitability and customer satisfaction / loyalty to engaged employees. The theory went on to prove that engaged employees raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experiences, foster brand loyalty, facilitate corporate and personal growth and increase market share. Here are my five top strategies that an organization can employ in order to improve workplace engagement. Strategy One: Bottom Up Approach. If you look at the 128 Egyptian pyramids that are located in Egypt you will see that they are still standing 4,019 years later because they were built with a strong foundation. The same can be said for employee engagement. Organizations who are desirous of improving employee engagement conduct questionnaires and employee surveys that allow employees to express their opinions, thoughts and concerns because this information creates the foundation for positive employee engagement. Court Holdings in Beamsville, Martinrea in Tillsonburg, Hammond power Solutions in Guelph and Ferrero in Brantford, just to name a few organizations are successful in their engagement strategies because they consistently request and receive employee feedback. These organizations realize that the more you ask for employee feedback, the more the employees feel respected and part of the organization. Strategy Two: Promote Two Way Communication. Employees must always be in the sunshine of communication and never in the dark. Communication that is divulged in secrecy or on a need to know basis creates a toxic work environment and causes lower engagement rates among employees. Two way communication promotes transparency which in turn leads to employee trust. Employees understand how decisions are made, they understand how the workplace is affected and what their role in the daily operations are. In order to be effective, communication must be a reciprocal event whereby employees are encouraged to share opinions, thoughts and concerns either in an open forum or in private. Strategy Three: Zero Tolerance For Poor Work & Recognize Good Work. Louis Armstrong once that; “my band is only as good as the worst musician. No matter how great other members are the audience always hears the worst.” The same is true for organizations. No matter how great your employees perform, when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, everyone in the business unit is dragged down to the common denominator, including your star employees. Sixty – five percent of Gallup pole contributors felt that they didn’t get enough or any recognition for a job well done. As a result, these employees learn to look out for themselves, deliver results that the others deliver and never work to their maximum potential. They also begin to look for work elsewhere and forty percent say they will leave their current job over the next twelve months. For this reason, it is wise to reward your top performers with perks and incentives that enrich the workplace environment. Strategy Four: Employ Competent Leaders. A well known recruiter Jorgen Sundberg says that the cost of hiring the wrong leader is the equivalent to 30 % of that persons first year salary. He is also quick to point out that this doesn’t include, poor morale issues, loss productivity, employee turnover or severance. In my opinion, an organizations secret weapon to employee engagement is leadership. Front line leaders are the middle people between front liners and executive members and in most cases rarely do front liners interact with executive personnel. Most if not all their interactions are with their immediate leaders (middle leaders) and whether front liners are feeling secure, angry, frustrated, ignored, appreciated and respected depends on the tact and diplomacy of the respective leader. “employee’s especially the stars – join a company and then quit their manager; it may not be the managers fault so much as these managers are not prepared to coach their employees nor do they have the skill set to get employees to the next level. Management is a skill and an art; the skill is understanding the job; the art is engaging employees.” Jim Clifton. Chairperson, Gallup International There is a reason why the Anheuser – Busch Brewing Company (ABBC) is efficiently efficient at the front line. With a 82 % engagement rating, they employ front leaders that understand employees, can engage employees at the highest level and understand employee needs. Being employed as a front leader at ABBC is not an easy task. Front line leaders go through a rigorous interview process that ensure that the right person is fully qualified, competent and comfortable in assuming the front line leadership position. The ABBC position is that this will reduce employee turnover, increase engagement and reduce the price on non – conformances. Strategy Five: Invest In Personal Growth. Investing in personal growth is part of the nurturing process of human capital management. Every human asset that an organization acquires ought to be polished and fostered into a long – term strategic organizational growth asset. Whether it is sponsoring in house training, higher education, outside relevant training or technical skills building – all creates a sense of loyalty and engagement amongst participants. Every employee craves a company that supports and invests in their well – being. Professional career training adds value to personal and corporate lives while increasing engagement and a sense of self worth. Summary. There are a few key takeaways that one can conclude from this publication. If an organization wishes to successfully craft strategies for engaging employees they may wish to keep the following principles in mind. They are: drive from the top and own from the bottom, ensure that talent management systems are enriching, communication is key to success, have a high level of intolerance for poor performance and ensure leaders are capable of shaping and nurturing positive experiences.

WHAT SHOULD LEADERS BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD? Sep 1, 2021 | Uncategorized Businesses will continue to struggle in order to grasp and understand which of the Covid 19 pandemic’s effects will be temporary and which will become permanent. Four new reports attempt to analyze these longer term trends. One is from Glassdoor in California; a website and information hub that allows employees to rank their employers. Another is a global management consulting agency in Massachusetts called the Boston Group which endeavours to provide strategic planning initiatives; McKinsey Global in Toronto which provides readers with a terrific insight to management challenges and the Chartered Management Institute in the United Kingdom which regulates Managers was also included. When read together, their message is clear – firms stand to benefit from the pandemic however, managerial life is going to dramatically change by getting a little more difficult. One change that is certain to last is employees working from home. McKinsey Global finds that 24 % of all Canadian workers surveyed wanted to work from home, 69 % would like to work at least three days a week from home and 7% desired to go back to the office full time. With organizations willing to accept such numbers for the most part perhaps, working from home has not dented productivity to the extent that many of us thought it would and some organizations have said productivity has improved in their areas. Flexible work schedules can be a frugal way of retaining talented employees who have child care or home responsibilities or, would just like to work from home in an introverted fashion due to preference or convenience. Offering potential cost savings, telecommuting is becoming increasingly popular among organizations. There is not only the reduction in office space leasing; there are other large potential cost savings elsewhere. Remote employees do not need to live in big cities where property is expensive. If employees live in cheaper places companies need not pay them as much. Glassdoor estimates that employees who leave San Francisco will eventually face salary reductions of 25 %; those leaving New York may lose 20 % and those in Toronto can easily expect a salary reduction of 10 %. As the reports point out, remote employees are in essence competing with a global workforce and are in a weaker bargaining position. Remember, this is just salary reductions; we haven’t begun to speak about bonuses, perks or benefits. These can add an additional 17 % reduction to the mix. This point is reinforced by the Boston Group survey which illustrates the pandemic has increased the willingness of organizations to work with freelancers and / or contract employees on a regular basis. Previously, many managers worried about legal and compliance issues associated with such options. This in turn prevented managers from using outside staff. Currently, in light of the pandemic – organizations have adjusted their operational and tactical business models that has lead to an abundance of talented outsiders acting as full time employees. Some pundits believe that this flexibility will lead to operational speeds that deliver quicker results and be more efficient on strategy. Despite remote workforce advantages there are a number of challenges that managers must deal with as the Chartered Management Institute points out. The Institute surveyed 2,300 managers and employees and the results underscored just how important effective communication and concern for employee well being is to good management practices. There is an interesting difference of perspective from an employee and management view. Nearly 61 % of all managers surveyed thought they were engaging employees in the decision making process since March of 2020 but, only 24 % of the employees agreed. The survey also illustrated that the experience of remote working hasn’t been uniform. Of those working virtual, 69 % of women with children wanted to work at least one day per week at home when the pandemic ends compared with 54 % of men with children. The reason that women gave was that they had little contact with their managers during the lockdown in comparison to men; which suggests that they may have been neglected. Also, 42 % of all North American employees from minority ethnic backgrounds thought that the workplace culture had got better during the crisis. Such a result would indicate that something was wrong with office culture beforehand. The Institute survey also found that black employees were more likely than any other ethnic group to feel that their managers did not trust them to undertake their role. So, managers might have a significant amount of work to do in order to build bridges with some of their employees. From a managerial standpoint, organizations may need to tailor their behaviour to individual employee needs. Although some organizations may have been concerned that remote working would lead to employees “slacking off”; it may appear that organizational leaders may have lost their way. Time spent on video conferencing has resulted in time taken away from speaking directly with employees. In a world of remote working, employees may stress the need for better communication with them. The future emphasis may not only be on “management by walking around”, it may also be on “management by dialing and zooming around”. A study by Burning Glass, a labour market analytics firm located in Boston, Massachusetts finds that thanks to remote work, more employees will have more flexibility over when, where and how they earn a living. Leaders will be indifferent as to whether their employees are working in Chicago or Montreal. The shift to a hybrid model of work, with some employees working in an office while others work from home is already taking shape. It is forcing managers to become much better communicators, thought provokers and stimulators in changing employment law and addressing perceived inequities. About The Author.
