On Wednesday, Halton District School Board trustees approved a motion to change the name of Ryerson Public School, which is located beside the Burlington park. Part of that motion included sending a letter to the mayor informing her of the name change. “I support the change the HDSB is making and the reasons behind it,” said a statement from Meed Ward. “As part of our continued commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion, I am working with City of Burlington staff to bring forward a report to Committee and City Council in July 2021 recommending removing the Ryerson name from our park and embarking on the council-approved naming process.” The renaming process is expected to be complete by November 2021, the same time-frame as the school renaming. “Our Indigenous community needs to enjoy our parks and public spaces without a reminder of one of the architects of the Residential School system and the legacy of harm it created for their people,” said Meed Ward. “Renaming our city park is one step we can take toward reconciliation with our Indigenous residents.” TAGS burlington halton region marianne meed ward ryerson park ryerson public school Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Email Print Previous articlePandemic update Next articleCanada’s lunar mission Andrea Lawson RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Home Page News Story Part of WB Highway 403 closed News Ontario PSW Association issues a statement following TikTok video backlash Canada News WATCH LIVE: Prime Minister Trudeau to provide COVID-19 update at 11:15 a.m. Canada News U.S. border restrictions to remain in place until end of July: public safety minister News Ontario reports 345 COVID-19 cases, one death Local News Police release dash-cam video of driver nearly hitting a child in Thorold LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

News Canada News Top News Story U.S. border restrictions to remain in place until end of July: public safety minister By Andrea Lawson - June 18, 2021, 10:53 am Travel restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border will remain in place for at least another month. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair says the American and Canadian governments are extending restrictions on non-essential international travel until July 21. As we have said, the government is planning measures for fully vaccinated Canadians, Permanent Residents, and others who are currently permitted to enter Canada and will provide further details on Monday, June 21. — Bill Blair (@BillBlair) June 18, 2021 He says the government will provide details on Monday about plans to let fully vaccinated Canadians and permanent residents enter the country. The measures at the border have been in place since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.

NACI had previously said AstraZeneca recipients could choose whether to get a second dose of the same vaccine, or an mRNA vaccine. But in new guidance released Thursday, NACI says Pfizer or Moderna are now “preferred” as the second dose. The advice doesn’t mean people can’t still choose AstraZeneca if they want, or if they are allergic to the mRNA vaccines. “People who received two doses of AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine can rest assured that the vaccine provides good protection against infection and very good protection against severe disease and hospitalization,” says NACI. As of June 5, 2.1 million Canadians had received one dose of AstraZeneca, and 15,186 had received two doses. There are no further shipments of AstraZeneca scheduled, but there are still about half a million doses of it in provinces.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Wednesday’s motion to rename the school passed unanimously. According to the board, the process will begin in September and will be completed by the end of November. Until then, the school’s current sign will be covered. More details on the renaming process will be released in the fall. It’s the latest school to move away from the name Ryerson, following the discovery of children’s remains outside former residential schools. The school was named after Egerton Ryerson, who was instrumental in the creation of Canada’s residential school system. “As trustees, we need to lead by example and have the courage to approach these difficult conversations,” says board chair Andrea Grebenc. “The perspectives of the diverse communities of Halton must be valued and honoured. Indigenous students, staff and the broader community should be able to enter a school without being harmed by the HDSB upholding the name of a person that has contributed to genocide.” Earlier this month, trustees at the Hamilton public school board approved a motion to rename Ryerson Public School in Hamilton. READ MORE: Hamilton trustees vote to rename Ryerson Elementary School The Halton school board will also send a letter to Burlington Mayor Marianne Meed Ward informing her of the decision to change the name. The community park next to the school is also named Ryerson.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Macdonald statue News Local News Petition calls for Hamilton to remove Sir John A. Macdonald statue By Andrea Lawson - June 25, 2021, 2:20 pm The Hamilton Centre for Civic Inclusion has started a petition to remove the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald from Gore Park. This latest push to remove the statue comes on the heels of the discovery of the remains of hundreds of children outside former residential schools in May and June. Other cities, including Kingston, have taken down memorials to Macdonald following these discoveries. Hamilton councillors are set to meet about the issue in July. Macdonald was Canada’s first prime minister and was key in the creation of the residential school system. “We stand in solidarity with all Indigenous community members who are re-traumatized each time they are forced to look upon the likeness of the perpetrators of these heinous crimes against them and their communities,” says the petition. “Welcoming and accepting societies do not commemorate and idolize individuals who have intentionally and unashamedly committed unspeakable atrocities.” WATCH: Protest calls for the removal of the Sir John A. Macdonald statue Indigenous community members held a protest in Gore Park on Sunday, calling for the statue to be taken down.

News Canada News Top News Story Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says this Canada Day should be a time of reflection By Andrea Lawson - June 25, 2021, 12:58 pm Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says this Canada Day should be a day to reflect on the country’s history. His comments come after a First Nation in Saskatchewan announced ground-penetrating radar had detected what are believed to be 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school. READ MORE: 751 unmarked graves discovered at former residential school in Saskatchewan Trudeau says he spoke to Cowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme about the discovery, as well as Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde. Indigenous communities across the country and many Canadians have been sharing their grief about the deaths of children who attended these schools, since an unmarked burial site was found in British Colubia in late May. Since then, some cities have decided to forgo parts of their usual Canada Day festivities. Trudeau says we all need to work hard to get to the point where everyone across this country can celebrate fully. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole has said he believes Canada Day shouldn’t be cancelled and the tragedies of the past should be used as motivation to build a better country.

Global Affairs Canada says they have received information suggesting Canadian citizens may be affected. .@CHCHTV @CHCHNews International Affairs tells me that the Surfside condo collapse may have involved Canadians. “We have received preliminary reports indicating that Canadian citizens may be affected. No further information is available at this time.” #surfside — Phil Perkins (@PhilPerkinsCHCH) June 25, 2021 Search and rescue teams are trying to detect any sounds coming from survivors of the collapse. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava says it’s “incredibly motivating” to watch the search and rescue teams risking their lives to find victims. Crews have heard some tapping and other noises, but officials emphasized that the rescuers don’t know whether the sounds are human-made or just caused by the settling of rubble. They have been removing debris using heavy cranes. At the same time, firefighters are tunneling from below to search for pockets in the rubble.

The Conservative caucus met Wednesday morning in advance of the House of Commons rising for its summer break. O’Toole called the discovery of the remains of 215 Indigenous children at a former B.C. residential school a “necessary awakening for our country.” READ MORE: Nationwide shock after remains of 215 children discovered at former residential school But added that the road to repairing that relationship doesn’t involve attempts to destroy Canada and spoke out against calls from some to cancel Canada Day celebrations. “I’m concerned that injustices in our past, or in our present, are too often seized upon by a small group of activist voices who use it to attack the very idea of Canada itself,” he said. Like other federal party leaders, O’Toole has had to respond to the discovery of the remains and demands for the government to make better progress on calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

On arrival, police learned that the owner of the building had hired a construction company to work on a metal staircase. The staircase fell on both the workers and one was apparently trapped beneath it for a period of time. Both were transported to hospital in non-life threatening condition. A City of Hamilton inspector went to the scene and later deemed the building safe. The Ministry of Labour has taken over this investigation.

The rule, which was part of a section 22 order put in place by Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Mustafa Hirji in November 2020, restricted diners to eating out only with members of their household with some exceptions. It also required restaurants, bars and breweries to gather contact information of patrons and ask about COVID-19 symptoms. The dining requirement was lifted on Thursday. Any four people will be able to sit at a patio and share a meal or drink, as per step one of Ontario’s reopening plan. That will change to six people when the province enters step 2 of the plan on June 30. READ MORE: Ontario Moves to Step Two of Reopening June 30th Daily cases in Niagara Region have decreased by 60 per cent over the past two weeks. Still, Dr. Hirji says progress is fragile. “Thanks to ongoing vigilance against COVID-19, cases continue to decline in Niagara allowing our businesses to continue to recover,” said Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Acting Medical Officer of Health. “However, other communities show us that this progress isn’t guaranteed. With the more contentious and more severe delta variant starting to circulate, we need ongoing vigilance around keeping distance, wearing masks, and limiting in-person social interactions until we have the vast majority our population vaccinated with two doses. If you have not already done so, please sign up to get vaccinated so we can make our economic reopening permanent.” TAGS COVID-19 Dr. Mustafa Hirji niagara region ontario patio dining Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Email Print Previous articleDerek Chauvin to be sentenced Friday in the death of George Floyd Next articleBrantford police say missing teen boy has been found safe Andrea Lawson RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Hamilton Crews on cargo ships say they’re having trouble getting vaccinated Canada & The World Fourth wave of COVID-19 may still be on the horizon this fall and winter Canada & The World Derek Chauvin sentenced to 22.5 years in prison for the death of George Floyd Hamilton Several people accidentally given the wrong vaccine dose at a Hamilton clinic Local News Petition calls for Hamilton to remove Sir John A.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

The assessments were shut down last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and were allowed to resume on June 14. But aspiring drivers say the backlog to book a road test is staggering. They either have to resort to accepting appointments far from home or else have to wait months for available time slots. One resident recently failed his test and says he can’t try again until next January. Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation says more than 421,000 tests have been cancelled since March 2020 due to pandemic-related lockdowns. It says it has invested $16 million to deal with the backlog. Last fall it said it would hire 84 temporary driver examiners for its DriveTest centres, and has so far filled 35 of those positions. It recently announced it would hire 167 additional driver examiners, and recruitment is underway with the goal to have everyone on board by September.

You can’t just stay beyond the contracted time. Ghulam hasnain July 2, 2021, 12:11 am at 12:11 am When laws in the province are so unfair for home owners and landlords that even the police don’t know where they should stand, this is what happens. Karen Bates July 2, 2021, 6:53 am at 6:53 am These people are officially now squatters and trespassing. This is illegal , so why are the police not doing their job. If the couple needs help then get it for them. No matter the reason they need to be escorted off the property. Home owners shouldn’t have to put up with this. Ridiculous . John Doctson July 2, 2021, 11:33 am at 11:33 am There’s risk in every investment, especially air bnb’s Simon Weresch July 2, 2021, 11:37 am at 11:37 am What many don’t know is that when air bnb renters refuse to leave they now have the residential tenancies act for protection and with the delays of covid and the wait lists for hearings can be a long and costly wait. As the owner of a property Management company we navigate and negotiate these issues routinely. Kym July 2, 2021, 11:40 am at 11:40 am Stop paying the utilities let it cut off on them Amanda July 2, 2021, 11:40 am at 11:40 am This right here is exactly whats going to scare people that have their homes on Airbnb. I know for me i would not be renting my place out after this. If there is no way to evict someone if they won’t leave. This system is crazy. Harry July 2, 2021, 11:47 am at 11:47 am Ripping home owners off is now an encouraged way of life thanks to the Landlord & Tenant Board. Anyone renting their home out to anyone these days needs to get their head examined. I don’t ever want to hear people moan about the lack of rental housing – why the market exists at all anymore is incredible to me. Kam July 2, 2021, 11:59 am at 11:59 am LTB is more than 6 months behind in hearing cases. Police won’t do anything to these freeloaders. Banks want their mortgages paid. What the hell is Ford Government doing ? Are they going to help the landlords ? Ontario is the worst province for landlords. By the way, I am not a landlord but do feel for the landlords in this pandemic. Joy Karney July 2, 2021, 12:09 pm at 12:09 pm We wonder why there is a shortage of rentals? The laws against homeowners who rent are ridiculous! There is no recourse against bad behavior in tenants. The laws must change!

News Canada News Top News Story Wildfire leads to evacuation order in B.C. village that set Canadian heat wave record By Andrea Lawson - July 1, 2021, 7:03 am A fast-spreading wildfire led to an immediate evacuation order Wednesday night for residents of Lytton, B.C. Mayor Jan Polderman issued the evacuation order at 6 p.m. local time. It said the wildfire was threatening structures and the safety of residents. Lytton is about a two-hour drive southwest of Kamloops. The village, which lists its population at about 250 people as of 2016, smashed a Canadian record for high temperatures three days in a row this week during an ongoing historic heat wave. Temperatures reached 49.6 Celsius. Most of Western Canada is still baking in extreme heat from that weather system. Conditions remain dangerously hot from southern and central B.C. and east through Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. B.C.’s chief coroner Lisa Lapointe says at least 486 sudden deaths have been reported to the B.C. Coroners Service since last Friday amid temperatures in the 30’s and 40’s.

News Canada News B.C. nations say 182 unmarked graves found in cemetery near former residential school By News Staff - July 1, 2021, 6:11 am Two First Nations say a search using ground-penetrating radar has found the remains of 182 people in unmarked graves at a site close to a former residential school in the southern Interior of British Columbia. But the leadership of the Ktunaxa community of aq’am says several factors make it difficult to establish whether the unmarked graves contain the remains of children who attended the institution. The Lower Kootenay Band, another Ktunaxa community in B.C.’s southern Interior, released a statement Wednesday saying ground-penetrating radar had detected the remains near the site of the former St. Eugene’s Mission School. The statement from aq’am says the history of the area is complex and analysis of the findings is ongoing, with preliminary results finding 182 unmarked graves, some as shallow as 90 centimetres, in a cemetery next to the institution. It says the cemetery was established around 1865 for settlers to the area and many of those buried there died at a nearby hospital that burned down in 1899. The statement from aq’am says hundreds of Ktunaxa children and those from neighbouring Indigenous nations attended the residential institution that was operated by the Catholic Church from 1912 to 1970.

In a post on his Twitter account, Trudeau says he made the decision as he and many Canadians reflect on the tragedy of the institutions. As people across the country continue to honour the Indigenous children whose lives were taken far too soon, and as we reflect on the tragedy of residential schools, I have asked that the flag on the Peace Tower remain at half-mast for Canada Day. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) June 30, 2021 Cowessess First Nation last week said that ground-penetrating radar detected 751 unmarked graves at the former Marieval Indian Residential School east of Regina, Sask., a few weeks after the finding of what are believed to be the remains of 215 children in Kamloops, B.C. RELATED STORY: Tribute left in Stoney Creek after burial site found at former B.C. residential school Canadian Heritage plans to still go ahead with virtual Canada Day events like last year, with an online music show featuring English, French and Indigenous artists. Several cities and communities across the country have decided to forgo parts of their usual Canada Day festivities. Events will be partially or fully cancelled in Saint John, Fredericton, Victoria, Wilmot Township in Ontario’s Waterloo region, and St. Albert, a city northwest of Edmonton, in solidarity with mourning Indigenous communities.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Indigenous activists are asking people to take some time today to reflect. Sherlene Bomberry went to the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, a former residential school, in the 1960’s. She says she never told anyone about her experience for years, but now she is speaking out. “When I heard about the 215, that’s when my body remembered. I was sitting there watching TV and started crying. I was never able to share how I really felt.” She says she has since taken back her power by going to indigenous ceremonies, using her language, and wearing traditional clothing. “I’m proud,” says Bomberry. One of the ceremonies will be held at Bayfront Park in Hamilton this afternoon. Jordan Carrier who is organizing the event says today is about coming together for healing. “It’s a tough day being Canada Day. I know a lot of proud Canadians are coming to this truth and they are not too sure where they sit with that. For myself, I’m not saying don’t ever celebrate Canada Day again, I’m just saying for this year pause and stand with us.” Carrier says non-indigenous people are welcome to come the ceremony to listen, hear and see indigenous culture.

They could not confirm the bodies discovered were all children “This could be triggering for many…we always knew there were graves here.” Chief Cadmus Delorme said headstones were once there, but they were removed by the Catholic church and never put back. The Cowessess First Nation says they are treating it as a crime scene. The discovery comes less than a month after 215 bodies were found on the site of a former residential school in Kamloops, B.C. Radar searches continue around each residential school in Canada.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Beginning Monday, residents who have had a full course of an approved COVID-19 vaccine will be able to skip the 14-day quarantine as they return to this country. To be considered fully vaccinated, you must be eligible to enter Canada, have received the full series of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine or a combination of accepted vaccines (Phizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD, Johnson & Johnson), received your last dose at least 14 days prior to the day you enter Canada, and have uploaded your proof of vaccination and results of a negative COVID-19 test that is less than three days old in the ArriveCAN app. Fully vaccinated Canadians & permanent residents travelling back into the country no longer have to quarantine. Air travellers don’t have to stay 3 days at the government approved hotel. No day 8 test either. @CHCHNews #TravelRestrictions #Canada pic.twitter.com/uxLznJPQjc — Sylvie Lendvay (@sylvie_lendvay) July 5, 2021 Canada Border Services Agency warns would-be travellers still may be denied entry if they were not eligible to travel to Canada before Monday. Residents were previously under rigid travel restrictions which included testing, quarantine and a hotel stopover for travellers arriving by air.

News Canada News Top News Story Wildfire leads to evacuation order in B.C. village that set Canadian heat wave record By Andrea Lawson - July 1, 2021, 7:03 am A fast-spreading wildfire led to an immediate evacuation order Wednesday night for residents of Lytton, B.C. Mayor Jan Polderman issued the evacuation order at 6 p.m. local time. It said the wildfire was threatening structures and the safety of residents. Lytton is about a two-hour drive southwest of Kamloops. The village, which lists its population at about 250 people as of 2016, smashed a Canadian record for high temperatures three days in a row this week during an ongoing historic heat wave. Temperatures reached 49.6 Celsius. Most of Western Canada is still baking in extreme heat from that weather system. Conditions remain dangerously hot from southern and central B.C. and east through Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. B.C.’s chief coroner Lisa Lapointe says at least 486 sudden deaths have been reported to the B.C. Coroners Service since last Friday amid temperatures in the 30’s and 40’s.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover.

Indigenous activists are asking people to take some time today to reflect. Sherlene Bomberry went to the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, a former residential school, in the 1960’s. She says she never told anyone about her experience for years, but now she is speaking out. “When I heard about the 215, that’s when my body remembered. I was sitting there watching TV and started crying. I was never able to share how I really felt.” She says she has since taken back her power by going to indigenous ceremonies, using her language, and wearing traditional clothing. “I’m proud,” says Bomberry. One of the ceremonies will be held at Bayfront Park in Hamilton this afternoon. Jordan Carrier who is organizing the event says today is about coming together for healing. “It’s a tough day being Canada Day. I know a lot of proud Canadians are coming to this truth and they are not too sure where they sit with that. For myself, I’m not saying don’t ever celebrate Canada Day again, I’m just saying for this year pause and stand with us.” Carrier says non-indigenous people are welcome to come the ceremony to listen, hear and see indigenous culture.

They could not confirm the bodies discovered were all children “This could be triggering for many…we always knew there were graves here.” Chief Cadmus Delorme said headstones were once there, but they were removed by the Catholic church and never put back. The Cowessess First Nation says they are treating it as a crime scene. The discovery comes less than a month after 215 bodies were found on the site of a former residential school in Kamloops, B.C.

Police say the goods were discovered Wednesday afternoon during a raid on a downtown home that was allegedly being used as a storage locker for stolen property. Officers seized the following items while executing a search warrant: 27 laptops 13 computer tablets 6 bicycles 3 E-bikes 3 cell phones Hamilton police say multiple charges have been laid in connection with the stolen property. Investigators say they were tipped off to the home by neighbours in the area. Residents are being reminded, ‘if you see something, say something.’ “Information is collected and resources are deployed accordingly to better serve the community,” said Hamilton police in a news release. “It is important to recognize that criminals find it difficult to operate in neighbourhoods where citizens take an active role in preventing crime.” Anyone who believes they are the rightful owner of property in the images is asked to contact Acting Sgt. David Wright by e-mail at dwright@hamiltonpolice.on.ca or by phone at 905-540-5093.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

We need to stop looking away from the homeless population in Canada. Mind you, some live off of scammers, many who panhandle on the corners and rotate mostly live under the same landlords who exploit them and take a percentage (which is usually most) of the money in exchange for providing a home and food. That’s why they leave the food where they are panhandling when you bring them something to eat. Reply LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

The twister uprooted trees, toppled fences, ripped roofs off houses, and sent several people to hospital with injuries. Residents in the neighbourhood where the tornado cut its path were forced to make quick decisions about what to do as the twister made its way toward their homes. While this wasn’t the first time a tornado wreaked havoc in the province, residents should reacquaint themselves with what to do if a tornado hits. The Government of Canada has compiled the following safety tips to follow during a tornado. If you are in a house Go to the basement or take shelter in a small interior ground floor room such as a bathroom, closet or hallway. If you have no basement, protect yourself by taking shelter under a heavy table or desk. In all cases, stay away from windows, outside walls and doors. If you live on a farm Livestock hear and sense impending tornadoes. If your family or home is at risk, the livestock will be a non-issue. If your personal safety is not an issue, you may only have time to open routes of escape for your livestock. Open the gate, if you must, and then exit the area in a tangent direction away from the expected path of the twister. If you are in an office or apartment building Take shelter in an inner hallway or room, ideally in the basement or on the ground floor. Do not use the elevator. Stay away from windows. If you are in a gymnasium, church or auditorium Large buildings with wide-span roofs may collapse if a tornado hits. If possible, find shelter in another building. If you are in one of these buildings and cannot leave, take cover under a sturdy structure such as a table or desk. Avoid cars and mobile homes More than half of all deaths from tornadoes happen in mobile homes. Find shelter elsewhere, preferably in a building with a strong foundation. If no shelter is available, lie down in a ditch away from the car or mobile home. Beware of flooding from downpours and be prepared to move. If you are driving If you spot a tornado in the distance go to the nearest solid shelter. If the tornado is close, get out of your car and take cover in a low-lying area, such as a ditch. In all cases Get as close to the ground as possible, protect your head and watch for flying debris. Do not chase tornadoes – they are unpredictable and can change course abruptly. A tornado is deceptive. It may appear to be standing still but is, in fact, moving toward you.

Beck was found suffering from multiple stab wounds outside a home in Binbrook just before 2 a.m. on July 26, 2020. He was rushed to hospital where he later died. RELATED STORY Hamilton Police searching for white sedan in connection with Brock Beck murder Last November, Hamilton police charged four Hamilton-area men with second-degree murder in connection with Beck’s death. On Friday, the men appeared virtually in a Hamilton courtroom where 22-year-old Thomas Vasquez, of Hamilton, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter. Nineteen-year-old Petar Kunic, of Stoney Creek, also pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily harm. Charges against 18-year-old Albin Gashi, of Stoney Creek, and 18-year-old Cam-Thai Khath, of Stoney Creek, were withdrawn. Police say the murder was fueled by a road rage incident that happened earlier in the night at the intersection of Binbrook Rd. and Highway 56. According to the agreed statement of facts, Gashi, Khath, Kunic, Vasquez and another friend were travelling west on Binbrook Rd. after leaving a house party. While stopped at the intersection, the group engaged in a verbal confrontation with Beck and his friend who were in a separate vehicle. The groups initially went their separate ways, however, a short time later, Beck and his friend were confronted in the driveway of a home on Binbrook Rd. by the group of men and a fight ensued. Vasquez and Kunic will appear in court on September 14 for sentencing.

The Penelakut Tribe says the discovery was made at the site of the former Kuper Island Industrial School. The school was dubbed “Canada’s Alcatraz” because of its remote location off the coast of Chemainus, south of Nanaimo and north of Victoria. It was in operation from 1890 to 1975. A statement on behalf of Chief Joan Brown of Penelakut Tribe called for neighbouring tribes and organizations to help raise awareness and face the trauma of these acts of genocide. “We understand that many of our brothers and sisters from neighboring communities attended the Kuper Island Industrial School. We also recognize with a tremendous amount of grief and loss, that too many did not return home. It is impossible to get over acts of genocide and human rights violations. Healing is an ongoing process, and sometimes it goes well, and sometimes we lose more people because the burden is too great,” said Brown. According to the Indian Residential School History & Dialogue Centre at the University of British Columbia, two sisters drowned while trying to escape the school in 1959 and another student committed suicide in 1966. The federal government took over the administration of the school in 1969 and closed it in 1975. In 1995, a former employee pled guilty to three charges of indecent assault and gross indecency.

Beginning Monday, residents who have had a full course of an approved COVID-19 vaccine will be able to skip the 14-day quarantine as they return to this country. To be considered fully vaccinated, you must be eligible to enter Canada, have received the full series of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine or a combination of accepted vaccines (Phizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD, Johnson & Johnson), received your last dose at least 14 days prior to the day you enter Canada, and have uploaded your proof of vaccination and results of a negative COVID-19 test that is less than three days old in the ArriveCAN app. Fully vaccinated Canadians & permanent residents travelling back into the country no longer have to quarantine. Air travellers don’t have to stay 3 days at the government approved hotel. No day 8 test either. @CHCHNews #TravelRestrictions #Canada pic.twitter.com/uxLznJPQjc — Sylvie Lendvay (@sylvie_lendvay) July 5, 2021 Canada Border Services Agency warns would-be travellers still may be denied entry if they were not eligible to travel to Canada before Monday. Residents were previously under rigid travel restrictions which included testing, quarantine and a hotel stopover for travellers arriving by air.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Indigenous activists are asking people to take some time today to reflect. Sherlene Bomberry went to the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, a former residential school, in the 1960’s. She says she never told anyone about her experience for years, but now she is speaking out. “When I heard about the 215, that’s when my body remembered. I was sitting there watching TV and started crying. I was never able to share how I really felt.” She says she has since taken back her power by going to indigenous ceremonies, using her language, and wearing traditional clothing. “I’m proud,” says Bomberry. One of the ceremonies will be held at Bayfront Park in Hamilton this afternoon. Jordan Carrier who is organizing the event says today is about coming together for healing. “It’s a tough day being Canada Day. I know a lot of proud Canadians are coming to this truth and they are not too sure where they sit with that. For myself, I’m not saying don’t ever celebrate Canada Day again, I’m just saying for this year pause and stand with us.” Carrier says non-indigenous people are welcome to come the ceremony to listen, hear and see indigenous culture.

He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Jacob Miranda, of Hamilton, has been charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000, and one count each of fraud under $5,000 and fail to comply probation. The 29-year-old was arrested Monday following a five-month-long investigation into a number of frauds involving the online sale of pro wrestling collectibles. Investigators say the victims were from outside of Canada. “Miranda is active on pro wrestling social media sites and uses his picture when conducting business but has been known to use multiple aliases,” said Hamilton police in a news release. In 2012, Miranda was convicted on 27 charges including fraud in a nationwide concert and sporting ticket scam. In 2015, he served roughly 18 months in jail for selling fake concert tickets online and two years later, he was charged in an alleged sports memorabilia scam. Investigators believe there may be more victims. and are asking anyone with information that could help police with the investigation to contact the Hamilton Police Major Fraud Unit at 905-546-3840.

A stark difference at this year’s celebration was the lack of fans and only a limited number of athletes participated in the parade due to COVID-19 restrictions. Flag-bearers Miranda Ayim and Nathan Hirayama led a group of about 30 to 40 Canadian athletes in the parade of more than 200 nations. #TeamCanada is here 🤩🇨🇦👋#OpeningCeremony pic.twitter.com/xGYdrMZCB1 — Team Canada (@TeamCanada) July 23, 2021 Ayim is set to make her third straight Olympic appearance in women’s basketball and Hirayama will be making his Olympic debut as co-captain of the men’s rugby team. The duo’s entrance makes history as this was the first time that two athletes from different sports led Team Canada together. Canadian athletes were donning outfits by Hudson Bay which included a lightweight and water-resistant jacket, and a t-shirt made of fast-dry, lightweight jersey. In total, about 5,700 athletes took part in the parade. A wooden set of Olympic rings was the centrepiece of the stadium. They were crafted from pine and spruce trees that grew from seeds that athletes were asked to bring to the 1964 Tokyo Games. Some of the seeds came from Canada. Time for some fireworks to celebrate the athletes after all countries have entered the Olympic Stadium 🎇🎆#OpeningCeremony pic.twitter.com/KtArD673QT — Team Canada (@TeamCanada) July 23, 2021 TAGS canada olympics sports Tokyo Tokyo 2020 Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Email Print Previous articleHelping families in need at The Baby Depot Next articleSerial fraudster arrested in international pro wrestling scam in Hamilton Shayla Vize RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Ontario News Ontario reports 192 new cases of COVID-19 Friday Local News Serial fraudster arrested in international pro wrestling scam in Hamilton Local News GO trains resume after pedestrian struck and killed by train in Burlington Ontario News London man drowns after falling off boat: OPP Local News Niagara police investigate after man exposes himself to teen girl Local News ‘Stop the Sprawl’ protestors fight to save farmland in Hamilton from further expansion LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Police say the girl was walking home in the area of Canborough Rd. and Townline Rd. around 10:30 p.m. on July 10. A man who was sitting in a small dark coloured vehicle got out of his car and began walking towards the teen on the sidewalk. Police say the man stood on behind a fence and exposed himself. He then got back into his vehicle and left the area. There was no physical contact or conversation between the teen and suspect, police say. The man is described as white, between 20 and 30 years of age, with a medium build. Niagara police are also investigating a separate incident involving a teen girl and a suspicious man in the same area. On July 11, a teen reported to police she had been followed by a man while out for a walk. It happened between 9:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. in the area of Townline Rd. and Wade Rd. Police say there was no interaction between the man and girl, however, a motorist who was passing by noticed the body language of the teen and suspected something was wrong. The motorist stopped and gave the teen a ride to her home. In this incident, the suspect is described as white, roughly five-foot-six, between 40 and 60 years of age, with a medium build and thinning grey or white hair. Police believe it is possible that the same man was involved in both incidents. “We recognize there are some differences between the two incidents, but there are also some similarities being the area of the occurrences, similar ages and sex of the victims, within a day of each other, walking females being approached,” said Niagara police Const. Phil Gavin. “We are still working to obtain some details from the victims and possible witnesses.” Police are asking residents and businesses in the area with security cameras to check their footage for anything that may help identify the person or people involved in these incidents. Anyone with information that could help police with the investigations is asked to contact the detective at 905-688-4111, ext. 1009935.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, made the announcement in Hamilton Friday morning alongside Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Minister of Labour, Filomena Tassi. The investment is part of a $1.7 billion project to convert the steel production process and phase out coal-fired steelmaking. The project will transition the Hamilton steelmaker to a hydrogen-ready, direct reduced iron–fed electric arc furnace. Officials say this will result in higher productivity, product quality, and energy efficiency at ArcelorMittal Dofasco. “Our government has been steadfast in defending and championing our steel workers. Today’s announcement, through the Net Zero Accelerator, is about investing in the low-carbon transformation of Canadian industry, taking serious action in the global fight against climate change and supporting good middle-class jobs in Hamilton,” stated Freeland in a news release. “We will continue to be there to support growth and a strong economic future for our steel workers and all the people of Hamilton.” ArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal said the announcement represents a historic moment for the steelmaker and will result in a 60 per cent drop in CO2 emissions within the next seven years. The company is Canada’s largest producer of flat-rolled steel and Hamilton’s largest private-sector employer. Federal officials say the project will make a significant contribution toward Canada’s achieving its climate goals, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 3 million tonnes per year by 2030.

Officers were called to the area of Barton St. and Oak Ave. around 5:15 p.m. Wednesday. Police say 23-year-old Donovan Hines was found suffering from gunshot wounds. He was taken to hospital where he remains in serious but stable condition. He is facing seven firearms-related charges, including discharging a firearm with recklessness. A surveillance camera on a nearby home captured the shocking incident unfold. A black, four-door vehicle can be seen slowly pulling up near the side patio of Allure Lounge on Oak Ave. The driver gets out and approaches a vehicle in the parking lot. Suddenly, the driver fires multiple shots into the vehicle through the open driver’s side door and runs back to his car. The man targeted in the parked vehicle then grabs his own gun and fires several shots through his windshield in the direction of the fleeing vehicle. Police are still trying to identify the shooter who fled the scene. They are searching for a 2007 or 2008 black Pontiac G5 and a man between 5’10 and 6 ‘5 in height. Detectives believe this was a targeted incident.

The 21-year-old won her second medal of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games by snagging a bronze in the women’s 200m freestyle. The Toronto-native has now won six Olympic medals in her career so far. Oleksiak still has to compete in the 100m freestyle and potentially three more relays — the women’s 4x200m freestyle as well as the women’s and mixed 4x100m medleys, the latter of which is being included on the Olympic program for the first time. This is Oleksiak’s second Summer Games appearance. She had a breakout performance at Rio 2016 where she won four medals. If she earns one more medal, she’ll surpass Cindy Klassen and Clara Hughes to become the nation’s most decorated Olympian of all time.

The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Officers issued 126 offence notices to drivers who failed to slow down and/or move over for emergency vehicles and tow trucks parked on the roadside while providing assistance to motorists. Police also handed out 199 seat belt, 95 alcohol/drug-impaired and 83 distracted driving charges, as well as 51 marine-related and 37 off-road vehicle-related charges.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

The Toronto man disappeared in the water on Sunday after he tried to help a friend who was struggling in the current. The pair had entered the waters while out for a hike with a group of friends from Toronto. Police arrived on scene and pulled a 22-year-old woman from the water in critical condition. She was then transported on a Niagara Jet Boat to the docks in Queenston and taken to hospital via ambulance where she later died. Officers from the Niagara Police Parks High Angle River Team, the Niagara police marine unit, the United States Coast Guard, the Canadian Coast Guard, and Niagara Jet Boats conducted vessel-based and shoreline searches for the man but he was not located. On Wednesday, the Marine Unit moved its search efforts to focus on the mouth of the river at Lake Ontario. Niagara police say officers will continue to search that area Thursday as well as the lower Niagara River.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

The sound of music and roaring of motorcycles was beginning to fill the air around 8 a.m. Friday as bikers made their way into the lakeside town for the traditional gathering. The festivities are expected to look slightly different today due to the pandemic. Port Dover councillor Amy Martin said the county did not issue permits for vendors who normally set up tents selling merchandise along the strip. Earlier this week, Norfolk County mayor Kristal Chopp said there would be no entertainment and noted the province’s limitations of 100 people for an outdoor gathering. Before the pandemic, the event would bring in nearly 200,000 motorcycle enthusiasts. Last November, roughly 3,000 people showed up. Acting Ontario Provincial Police Sgt. Ed Sanchuk was on site Friday morning and was surprised at the number of visitors. “I was actually shocked that we didn’t have a line of motorcycles coming into town,” said Sanchuk. “I think when we actually have people coming down here, but most are coming in and then leaving.” Sanchuk believes traffic will get heavier throughout the day but says there is no way of knowing exactly how many people will take part in the rally. “Right now it’s a roll of dice for how many people we are going to be expecting today. But I can tell you there is an increased police presence and we will respond to any calls of service that may come our way,” said Sanchuk. “Please make sure you enjoy yourself in a safe and responsible manner. Properly distance yourself and follow the proper guidelines.” Slow start to #FridayThe13th however #Motorcycle enthusiasts are arriving in #PortDover. Please make sure YOU #PayAttention and #drivesafe.

Michael Spavor was found guilty of spying and illegally providing state secrets to foreign countries. Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were detained in December 2018. Many critics believe the pair was arrested in a move of hostage politics after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested in December 2018 at the Vancouver airport. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement following the verdict, calling it “absolutely unacceptable and unjust.” “The verdict for Mr. Spavor comes after more than two and a half years of arbitrary detention, a lack of transparency in the legal process, and a trial that did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law,” the statement reads. “For Mr. Spavor, as well as for Michael Kovrig who has also been arbitrarily detained, our top priority remains securing their immediate release. We will continue working around the clock to bring them home as soon as possible. Our thoughts, and the thoughts of all Canadians, are with Mr. Spavor and his loved ones during this incredibly difficult time. The Government of Canada continues to provide consular assistance to Mr. Spavor and his family as we work to secure his safe return.” Canadian Ambassador Dominic Barton says Spavor has two weeks to decide whether to appeal. The Dandong Intermediate People’s Court said Spavor would be deported, without specifying whether it was before or after he served his prison sentence.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Local News Hamilton News Top News Story Homeless people in Hamilton living in encampments have three weeks to find housing before a city-mandated eviction By Dominick Nagy - August 10, 2021, 9:25 pm Hamiltonians experiencing homelessness have three weeks to find housing as the city sets to revert back to pre-pandemic laws that don’t allow camping overnight on city property. While city officials say encampments aren’t safe and they have housing available, advocate groups say this is another example of the criminalization of homelessness. Phil Perkins reports.

That’s a fact. I’m not sure where these people are supposed to go. Encampments might not be the answer but there is a housing crisis, rent is at an all time high, it’s really hard, I feel for these people. Jason August 11, 2021, 8:12 am at 8:12 am What housing is available? The umaffordable housing? Because theres something like a 10 year wait list for affordable housing at this point Ess Cee August 11, 2021, 8:22 am at 8:22 am People would not be living this way if we treated EVERYONE with the same dignity and respect as you recieve. It’s called “Treat others, The Same As You To Want To Be Treated”. When will we acheive this? ECM August 12, 2021, 8:58 pm at 8:58 pm I don’t see why a campground hasn’t been opened in Hamilton. Not a for profit one, a cooperative campsite that has standards as to what is allowed around the campsites. Because witnessing trafficking at the Beasley was very repulsive. Comments are closed.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

The United States says further attempted attacks are expected ahead of the August 31st deadline for foreign troops to leave, ending America’s longest war. Kabul residents say several flights took off Friday morning. Thursday’s bombings near Kabul’s international airport killed at least 95 afghans and 13 u-s troop members. Officials say the actual death toll is even higher because others were involved in evacuating bodies. Ottawa officials confirm no Canadian military members were hurt. Acting chief of defence staff general Wayne Eyre says it is heartbreaking that Canadian soldiers could not stay longer in Afghanistan to rescue everyone who was so desperate to leave the war-torn country. An unknown number of Canadians and their families remain trapped in Afghanistan, after the federal government announced the end of its evacuation mission yesterday. Canada boarded around 37-hundred Canadian nationals and afghan refugees onto evacuation flights in recent weeks.

But starting on Monday, they will no longer have to quarantine upon arrival, even if they have not been fully vaccinated. Many British Canadians were frustrated after being snubbed by the plan to ease quarantine restrictions for entry to England and Scotland last month.

Canada evacuated around 3,700 people from Afghanistan, which fell to the Taliban earlier this month. At a briefing this morning, Eyre said Canada stayed in Afghanistan as long as it could. He added that it is heartbreaking the military could not stay longer and rescue more Afghans. The majority of Canadian personnel left Kabul airport around 12:00 a.m. Eastern time. The White House reports 13,400 people were evacuated in 24 hours from early this morning on Washington time. That included 5,100 people aboard U-S military planes and 8,300 on coalition and partner aircraft.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

The United States says further attempted attacks are expected ahead of the August 31st deadline for foreign troops to leave, ending America’s longest war. Kabul residents say several flights took off Friday morning. Thursday’s bombings near Kabul’s international airport killed at least 95 afghans and 13 u-s troop members. Officials say the actual death toll is even higher because others were involved in evacuating bodies. Ottawa officials confirm no Canadian military members were hurt. Acting chief of defence staff general Wayne Eyre says it is heartbreaking that Canadian soldiers could not stay longer in Afghanistan to rescue everyone who was so desperate to leave the war-torn country. An unknown number of Canadians and their families remain trapped in Afghanistan, after the federal government announced the end of its evacuation mission yesterday. Canada boarded around 37-hundred Canadian nationals and afghan refugees onto evacuation flights in recent weeks.

But starting on Monday, they will no longer have to quarantine upon arrival, even if they have not been fully vaccinated. Many British Canadians were frustrated after being snubbed by the plan to ease quarantine restrictions for entry to England and Scotland last month. The United Kingdom announced on July 28th that fully vaccinated travelers from the United States or Europe would not have to quarantine upon arrival.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

The province said six of the deaths occurred more than a month ago. The data is based on more than 28,247 tests completed on the previous day. The province says 35,844 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the last 24-hour period for a total of more than 21 million. Health Minister Christine Elliott says 84.1 per cent of Ontarians aged 12 and older have received one dose and nearly 77.7 per cent have two doses. There are currently 177 patients in intensive care with COVID-related critical illnesses and 113 on ventilators. The province says of those in hospital, 264 are unvaccinated individuals, 25 are partially vaccinated and 44 are fully vaccinated. Of the province’s 626 long-term care homes, at least seven are in an outbreak including R. H. Lawson Eventide Home in Niagara Falls and Hampton Terrace Care Centre in Burlington. An active COVID-19 outbreak indicates that the home has at least one lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 (in resident or staff) and the local public health unit or the home has declared an outbreak.

Police received reports of a break and enter at a home on Bruce St. around 4 a.m. on Tuesday. Investigators were told a woman had smashed the front window of the home before crawling through to get inside. She allegedly caused “a disturbance” and then physically assaulted the resident before fleeing the home. Officers arrived on scene and attempted to take the woman into custody but she resisted and attempted to hit the officers. Police eventually arrested a 33-year-old woman. She has been charged with mischief under $5,000, assault, break and enter, and resist arrest. Police say the woman and victim are known to each other and this was not a random incident.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Officers were called to a single-vehicle collision on Queen St. near Dalhousie St. just before 4 a.m. on Sept. 5. Police say officers spoke with the driver and observed signs of impairment. They say the driver initially lied to police about how the collision occurred. Investigators learned that while the man was driving, he collided with an unoccupied vehicle that was parked at the side of the roadway and then left the scene. He was arrested and given a breath test which showed he had over twice the legal alcohol limit in his system. A Burford, Ont. man has been charged with operation while impaired, 80 and over, obstruct peace officer, and fail to stop after accident. The man’s license was suspended and his vehicle was impounded.

Police say thieves have used relay and reprogramming technology to steal six vehicles in Brantford in the last week. In a relay theft, the thief will approach a residence and use technology to find a key fob signal from inside a home. The technology allows the suspects to remain outside the residence to amplify and transfer the key fob signal in order to unlock, start and steal the vehicle. In a reprogramming theft, the criminal will break into a vehicle and once inside, use an electronic device to access the vehicle’s diagnostics. The suspects then reprogram a blank key fob so the vehicle can be started. Brantford police say all six vehicles stolen this week were newer model, high-end vehicles with keyless entry and push start technology. They say four addresses were targeted during the overnight hours of Sept. 4 and 5. Two Lexus RX5’s were stolen from Tom Thompson Crt. and Warner Lane and three Toyota 4Runner’s were stolen from Varley Crescent and from a Toyota dealership at 5 Woodyatt Dr. A Toyota Highlander was also stolen from the dealership. Police are asking anyone with information about these incidents to contact investigators. Police have also offered the following tips to help keep your vehicles safe. Park your vehicle inside a locked and secure garage. Block access to the onboard diagnostic port to prevent thieves from reprograming the vehicle’s key fob. (A simple device can be purchased online). Use a steering wheel locking device to deter theft. Place the vehicle key fob inside a radio frequency shielding bag/pouch to block cell signals when not in use. Inside your residence and in a purse or pocket. Consider equipping your vehicle with an aftermarket global positioning system (GPS) tracker. The tracker may assist police in locating the vehicle and/or suspects. Ensure all keys are accounted for and never left in the vehicle or unattended. Lock your vehicle at all times. Never leave your vehicle running and unattended. Consider purchasing a surveillance system and ensure the quality and function will capture any suspicious activity for a 24 hour period.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

London police say four women have come forward with formal complaints about being sexually assaulted on campus recently. Police are also investigating allegations made on social media of mass drugging and sexual assaults at the Medway-Sydenham Hall residence on campus during orientation week. However, no formal complaints have been received regarding those allegations. READ MORE: Reports of sexual violence at Western University during orientation week One of the protest organizers said the walkout will also protest the University’s response to the allegations. Several sexual assault survivors are expected to speak to students who leave their classes at noon. Western says it has created a new action plan that will increase safety and security. The plan includes the hiring of new special constables, enhancing security patrols, and implementing in-person sexual violence training for all students in residence. “This has been a tremendously difficult time for our students and the entire Western community. We clearly have a culture problem that we need to address. We let our students and their families down,” said President Alan Shepard in a message posted on the University’s website on Thursday. “The measures announced today are the first step in a journey to deeply examine the prevailing culture on our campus and identify what more we can do to ensure the safety and security of every member of our community.” Shepard says these actions are just the beginning steps to ensuring students feel safe.

Officers were called to the area of Ormond St. South and Lyndon St. East around 7:48 p.m. on Sept. 7. Police say a 12-year-old boy was walking with four friends on a trail in the area of Ormond St. South and Dock Rd. after the group had gone swimming nearby. A man approached the children and sexually assaulted the 12-year-old boy. The suspect then left the area on foot. Police were quickly notified about the incident and the K9 Unit flooded the area but were not able to locate the man. He is described as being white, between 40 and 50 years of age, with a medium build, grey or black “scruffy” hair, and a “belly.” He was wearing a grey or black shirt, baggy jeans, and a ball cap. Detectives have reason to believe there were members of the public or possible witnesses in the area within minutes after the assault happened. Investigators have released a drone video of where the incident occurred. Police are asking any businesses or residents in the area with closed-circuit security cameras, doorbell video cameras, or dash cameras, to review their footage for any suspicious activity between 6:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. on Sept. 7. Anyone with information that could help police with the investigation is asked to contact detectives at 905-688-4111, ext. 1008430.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

The scam started nearly a year ago when a senior was contacted by a person claiming to be a man named Darren Michaelson. A romantic relationship began online between the senior and the man they believed was a retired Canadian Army Sergeant. The victim was deceived into sending money with the intent of alleviating “Michaelson’s” legal troubles and helping him return to Canada. Police say the victim was defrauded of more than $150,000. A 21-year-old Oakville woman, a 38-year-old London woman, and three Toronto men, aged 36, 35, and 28, have all been arrested and charged in connection with the scam. Police believe there may be more victims and anticipate more charges will be laid. Police are reminding residents of the dangers and frequency of these types of scams. “Do not send money or gift cards to persons you have not met in person,” said police in a news release. “Do not provide your personal information such as financial documents, identification or passwords when communicating online.” Anyone with information regarding this investigation is asked to contact Det. Const. Derek Gray at 905-825-4747, ext. 2344.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Officers were called to the Walmart on Upper James St. around 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday for a “premise disturbance.” Investigators learned a male and female inside the McDonald’s were arguing with staff about the recently implemented proof-of-vaccination system. Police say the woman was not wearing a mask and refused to show her vaccine certificate. She then took a seat in the dining room and would not leave the store. While officers were en route to the scene, police were told the woman struck a staff member in the face before exiting the restaurant. The duo fled the area before police arrived on scene. Police are trying to determine the identity of the woman. She is described as white, between 25 and 30 years of age, roughly five-foot-seven, with a medium build, and blonde shoulder-length hair. Police say she was wearing black pants and a black jacket. Anyone with information that could help with the investigation is asked to contact police.

Trudeau had hoped the election would result in a majority government but the Liberals fell short of the 170 seats needed to make that happen. An official result will not be announced until nearly 800,000 mail-in ballots are counted. Elections Canada says that process will begin Tuesday. The Liberal party was hovering between 155 and 157 seats early Tuesday morning. The Conservatives were sitting with roughly 120 seats. They will remain the official opposition with leader Erin O’Toole at the helm. O’Toole has been re-elected in the Ontario riding of Durham. He delivered a speech in Oshawa and called on Conservatives not to waiver from the party’s commitment to grow and earn the trust of more voters. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has won re-election in his riding of Burnaby-South in British Columbia. Singh said Canadians can count on his New Democrats to continue fighting to help people weather the COVID-19 pandemic under a re-elected Liberal minority government. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul lost in the Ontario riding of Toronto Centre. Locally, many ridings had clear winners while others will have to wait until all ballots are counted.

The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

Two of the false-positive tests played a role in outbreaks being declared at two Hamilton schools, Lisgar Elementary school and Bishop Ryan Catholic Secondary school. Hamilton public health has since rescinded the outbreaks. Seven other people who were told they did not have the virus actually did. All individuals who received incorrect test results have been contacted. In January the lab made a similar mistake with 31 people getting the wrong results.

Green Party Leader Annamie Paul is stepping down just one week after her loss during the federal election. Paul announced her resignation Monday morning in Toronto, saying she does not have the heart to keep this position after learning that a leadership review had been initiated. “I just asked myself whether this is something that I wanted to continue, whether I was willing to continue to put up with the attacks I knew would be coming, whether to continue to have to fight and struggle just to fulfill my democratically elected role as leader of this party,’” Paul said. “I just don’t have the heart for it.” In the 2021 federal election, Paul did not win her seat in the riding of Toronto-Centre and just two seats went to the Greens in the House of Commons. The Greens’ share of the popular vote also decreased as they drew 2.3 per cent, which is less than half of the 6.55 per cent they received in the last election. “The election was very difficult,” Paul said. She attributed it to a lack of funding, campaign staff and a national campaign manager. Following her announcement, leaders of other federal parties responded to the news on Twitter. Thank you @AnnamiePaul for your leadership. For your resilience and perseverance. You made it possible for an entire generation of Canadians to see themselves reflected in politics. On behalf of so many Canadians, thank you. — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) September 27, 2021 Thank you @annamiepaul for your perseverance & for being a trailblazer for Canadians from all backgrounds interested in public service. I always appreciated our discussions and admire your tenacity. Wishing you and your family well. — Erin O'Toole (@erinotoole) September 27, 2021 Although I completely disagree with her political views, I have great respect for @AnnamiePaul. She is a nice and decent person, something I cannot say about other party leaders. She was viciously attacked by extremists in her party. I wish her good luck in her next endeavours. — Maxime Bernier (@MaximeBernier) September 27, 2021 Paul was the leader of the Green Party since October 2020 and the first Black Jewish woman to lead a major political party in Canada. There is currently no word on who will replace her.

Two Canadians who spent almost three years detained in Chinese prisons returned to Canada Saturday morning. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor arrived at Calgary International Airport around 8 a.m. EDT. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Global Affairs Minister Marc Garneau welcomed the two Michaels before they reunited with loved ones. Spavor remained in Calgary with family, while Kovrig boarded a plane destined for Toronto. Kovrig arrived just before 1 p.m. at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Kovrig and Spavor departed for Canada late Friday night shortly after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou flew to China after solving her legal conflict with the U-S. The case came to an end Friday once Meng pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges involving American sanctions against Iran. Meng then walked out of a British Columbia Supreme Court after a judge agreed to a discharge order that withdrew a U-S extradition request that led to her 2018 arrest in Vancouver. The two Michaels were arrested in China on espionage charges days later in 2018 but China has always denied accusations it was retaliating for Meng’s arrest. Kovrig and Spavor endured harsh conditions in Chinese prisons where they could barely access the outside world. Meng, however, was kept under house arrest at her Vancouver mansion.

Trudeau had hoped the election would result in a majority government but the Liberals fell short of the 170 seats needed to make that happen. An official result will not be announced until nearly 800,000 mail-in ballots are counted. Elections Canada says that process will begin Tuesday. The Liberal party was hovering between 155 and 157 seats early Tuesday morning. The Conservatives were sitting with roughly 120 seats. They will remain the official opposition with leader Erin O’Toole at the helm. O’Toole has been re-elected in the Ontario riding of Durham. He delivered a speech in Oshawa and called on Conservatives not to waiver from the party’s commitment to grow and earn the trust of more voters. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has won re-election in his riding of Burnaby-South in British Columbia. Singh said Canadians can count on his New Democrats to continue fighting to help people weather the COVID-19 pandemic under a re-elected Liberal minority government. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul lost in the Ontario riding of Toronto Centre. Locally, many ridings had clear winners while others will have to wait until all ballots are counted.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property. Police say the investigation is ongoing and more charges could be laid. They recommend that you record the serial number on your bike, and call police if it’s been stolen.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Police say a 17-year-old girl was sitting on a bench along the Waterfront Trail around 6:30 p.m. on Sept. 20. A man in his 50s or 60s was seen taking photos of the girl. Police say he then sat beside the teen and touched her breast before fleeing the area on foot. The suspect is described by police as Asian, roughly five-foot-nine, with a thin build, and noticeable wrinkles. He spoke with a thick accent and was wearing a white t-shirt with red sleeves, and a grey baseball hat with a white design on the front. The man was carrying a cell phone with a bright red case. Investigators are hoping to speak with two young males who may have witnessed the incident on the bench. Police say one of the boys was on a bike and the other was riding a skateboard. Anyone with information that could help police with the investigation is asked to contact detectives at 905-825-4777, ext. 8971.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday. St. Anne Catholic Elementary school in Burlington has had to close down one classroom after 4 cases were reported Tuesday night. There are currently active 14 outbreaks in Halton region. The region’s Medical Officer of Health says the region continues to see community transmission. She is asking residents to avoid carpooling, and having coffee and play dates.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.

The Public Health Agency of Canada says it’s working with other governments still uncertain about allowing Canadians with mixed vaccines to enter their countries. The United States is one of multiple countries that only recognize people with two identical doses of an approved vaccine as being fully vaccinated. Oxford-AstraZeneca is not an approved vaccine in several places. Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the agency has provided data on the effectiveness of mixed doses to the U.S. and other top-priority destinations. She says Canada has been spreading information about the effectiveness of mixing Oxford-AstraZeneca with m-R-N-A vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. At least 3.88 million fully vaccinated Canadians have received two different kinds of shots, not including those from Quebec where data on mixed vaccines is unavailable. Of those, around 1.5 million Canadians received a first dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca or Covishield, which uses the same formula.

Packages of Advil’s Cold and Sinus Day/Night Convenience Pack are being recalled due to a labelling mistake. The boxes of 18 and 36 caplets were affected as the night-time doses were mislabelled as daytime and vice versa. Health Canada says there are concerns about consumers mixing up the medications. The health agency also says taking a night-time caplet could lead to serious health consequences for the elderly, anyone driving or for those who have taken other sedatives or consumed alcohol. The affected products were distributed in Canada beginning last July.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he regrets traveling to meet his vacationing family in British Columbia on the country’s inaugural National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. During a COVID-19 news conference being held in Ottawa Wednesday morning, Trudeau acknowledged the trip was an error. “Traveling on September 30 was a mistake and I regret it. The first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation was a time for Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people alike to reflect and connect. To think about the past, but also focus on the future,” said Trudeau. Trudeau was captured on video by a Global News cameraperson walking along a beach in Tofino, B.C. while declining to make any comment. The video came as a shock because the Prime Minister’s itinerary stated he was in Ottawa for private meetings. According to The Canadian Press, a spokesman for Trudeau said he spent several hours on the phone with eight people who lived through residential schools and denied that the prime minister had used the historic day to take a vacation. The trip sparked widespread backlash from Indigenous leaders, who felt it was disrespectful of him not to join other politicians in attending events held to honour the children who never came home.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the new federal policy during a news conference in Ottawa Wednesday morning. There will be a one-month grace period where proof of a negative COVID-19 test will be accepted for travel but by November 30, all travelers in federally regulated air, rail and marine services will need to be fully vaccinated. The government says testing exemptions will only be allowed in extremely limited emergency situations. Air travel operators will be responsible for verifying proof of vaccination which can include paper copies or provincial vaccination passports. The government says it will work with the cruise industry to put in place strict requirements ahead of the 2022 cruise season. Federal employees have until October 29 to provide their vaccine status after which they could have limited access to their workplace or be placed on administrative leave without pay. The policy applies to more than 267,000 workers. It does not apply to employees of crown corporations or members of the Canadian Armed Forces, however, they are asked to enforce similar measures.

The Grace Anglican Church started the planning process on the centre four years ago. They are calling it “Bobby’s Place”, named after local Bobby Smylie who died from the flu in 2018 at the age of 10. The church says the centre will provide a meeting space to learn, socialize, and grow. Construction on “Bobby’s Place” will begin in a few weeks and they hope to have it finished by the Fall.

Police say they executed a search warrant at a home in the east end last Thursday and found 26 mountain bikes, along with bike parts, high-end skis and prohibited weapons. They believe the bikes were stolen from residential and commercial properties in Ancaster, Aldershot and Dundas. They say most of the bikes had been taken apart and the parts had been swapped, to try to disguise them. So far, police have returned 3 of the 26 bikes to their owners, and hope to return the rest of them in the next two weeks. Jason Kane, 43, of Hamilton, is facing a number of charges including two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, and three counts of possession of stolen property.

Twenty-nine year old Obsa Junedi Mohamed was gunned down outside of Boulevard Billiards on York Boulevard at around 1:30 Saturday morning. Police say his killer was his friend, 26-year-old Ibrahim Issak Hussen. The two men were hanging out with a group of other men for awhile before the shooting. About 10 minutes before the shooting detectives say Junedi Mohamed and Issak Hussen got into a physical altercation. Hussen goes by the street name “Seemo.” Junedi Mohamed’s street name was Nanny or Chappel. Detectives say Hussen shot Mohamed point blank in the head. The whole incident was caught on surveillance video. Surveillance images released in the media led to the driver of the getaway vehicle turning himself in to police on Saturday. That man was arrested for first degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Police say he participated in a lengthy interview and was released unconditionally later Saturday. But another man was also in the car and police want to speak to him. They are looking for an Asian male wearing a dark parka with fur trim on the hood. The victim was known to police. He was found by officers hiding after another shooting in the same area back in 2015. At the time he was charged with failing to comply and possession of cocaine. Issak Hussen is also known to police and investigators believe drugs are involved in this incident as well.

News Evening News Local News Two Hamilton women were invited to meet Taylor Swift at the star’s Nashville mansion By Laura Brody - August 22, 2019, 5:23 pm Two young women from Hamilton were treated to an experience of a lifetime by their ultra-famous idol- Taylor Swift. The multi-grammy award winning pop star hand selected about 100 mega fans from around the world to attend a secret album preview party at her Nashville mansion and 25-year-old Nichole Ridehalgh and 17-year-old Isabella Rose both got a phone call from Swifts team. Ridehalgh was shocked when she called the call inviting her to a special event. She was asked if she could make it to Nashville in less than a week. Without being told, Ridehalgh knew she had just been invited to an event that is the pinnacle of every Taylor Swift fan’s dream- a secret session album preview at the star’s Nashville mansion. Swift has held secret sessions before the releases of several of her previous albums. Fans are picked up at a secret location and driven to her mansion. Those who attend are always mega fans who the star keeps a close eye on on social media. Getting a one on one chat with the star is something Ridehalgh will never forget. “Its 4:30 in the morning, I’m exhausted but, this is my moment. I walk into the room and I turn to my left and I see her and she says hey your Nichole right?Aand in that moment my whole world was made. Without me mentioning Canada at all, she said have a safe flight back to Canada” Swift even shared secret details about her personal life with fans. Isabella Rose is also on a first name basis with Swift. She posted on social media saying “I have loved her for nine years and I will never stop talking about how much I love her but I would not be where I am today without her.” Tonight is the release of Swift’s newest album, Lover. Ridehalgh and Rose were two of 113 fans in the world, that have already heard it. “She was lip syncing and dancing. She was just having a blast.” And that night is a night these young women will replay over and over again.

Two of the false-positive tests played a role in outbreaks being declared at two Hamilton schools, Lisgar Elementary school and Bishop Ryan Catholic Secondary school. Hamilton public health has since rescinded the outbreaks. Seven other people who were told they did not have the virus actually did. All individuals who received incorrect test results have been contacted. In January the lab made a similar mistake with 31 people getting the wrong results.

Constable Frank Trasmundi with Halton Police says sometimes when people report their bicycle stolen, the owner won’t have the serial number. If that’s the case, police can’t return it or lay charges. He says downloading the app ‘529 Garage’ can help people file a report. “We will have picture of your bike, the serial number, and any distinguishing features so it will be easier for us to recover it if we find it.” says Trasmundi. Halton Police recovers 200 bikes per year on average. Only about 10-15 of them are returned.

There’s been a lot of talk about a vaccine coming; we know we’re getting that but that’s not the silver bullet. That’s not the only solution. We are going to continue, for at least a year, to need to be keeping physical distance, hand washing, wearing a mask when out in public. Those measures are going to be critically important throughout 2021.” Halton reported 92 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday.

Local News Halton News Is Halton heading back to a modified Stage 2? By Laura Brody - October 23, 2020, 8:52 pm Premier Doug Ford is concerned about Halton region’s rising case numbers and says a decision will be made by Monday whether or not to send the region back to modified Stage 2. Halton region is approaching 2,000 total COVID-19 cases; half of which have been recorded in the last two months. “We’re going to have to discuss that over the weekend and we’ll have that answer on Monday. But folks in Halton, I know they’re doing a great job. It’s concerning right now. I’ve seen the numbers go up.” said Premier Doug Ford. “The premier has been terrific to work with throughout this. We recorded 16 new cases today. That’s like 1 in 35,000 people here. I think curves on small numbers are very unreliable ways to judge the future.” said Oakville Mayor Rob Burton. Oakville has already restricted indoor group fitness classes and team sports. The modified Stage 2 would prohibit indoor dining, and close gyms, fitness centres, cinemas and performance venues.
