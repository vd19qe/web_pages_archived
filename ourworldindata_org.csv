The Our World in Data COVID vaccination data To bring this pandemic to an end, a large share of the world needs to be immune to the virus. The safest way to achieve this is with a vaccine. Vaccines are a technology that humanity has often relied on in the past to bring down the death toll of infectious diseases. Within less than 12 months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several research teams rose to the challenge and developed vaccines that protect from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Now the challenge is to make these vaccines available to people around the world. It will be key that people in all countries — not just in rich countries — receive the required protection. To track this effort we at Our World in Data are building the international COVID-19 vaccination dataset that we make available on this page. Data sources: at the end of this page you find a detailed list of all our country-specific sources. Open access: as with all of our data, we are making this dataset openly available, so that everyone can check and use the data that we bring together. You find the vaccination data in our daily-updated repository on GitHub. Country-by-country data on COVID-19 vaccinations This page has a number of charts on vaccination. In the box below you can select any country you are interested in — or several, if you want to compare countries. All charts on this page will then show data for the countries that you selected.

This resource is published by researchers at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford: Thomas Hale, Anna Petherik, Beatriz Kira, Noam Angrist, Toby Phillips and Samuel Webster. The tracker presents data collected from public sources by a team of over one hundred Oxford University students and staff from every part of the world. The data presented here is taken directly from the OxCGRT project; Our World in Data do not track policy responses ourselves, and do not make additions to the tracker dataset. These charts are regularly updated based on the latest version of the response tracker. OxCGRT is an ongoing collation project of live data. If you see any inaccuracies in the underlying data, or for specific feedback on the analysis or another aspect of the project please contact OxCGRT team. See the tracker’s notes and guidance on data quality. Click to open interactive version Attitudes to COVID-19 vaccinations The Imperial College London YouGov Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub gathers global insights on people’s behaviors in response to COVID-19. This survey covers public behaviors and attitudes ranging from mask-wearing to self-isolation, social distancing, symptoms and testing. The following chart shows monthly data on public willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Data represents the share of respondents that agree with the following statement: “If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” Respondents were presented with a 1 to 5 scale, ranging from “Strongly agree” (1) to “Strongly disagree” (5). We consider responses of 1 or 2 to be in agreement with the statement. Click to open interactive version Vaccine development: vaccines approved for use and in clinical trials The speed at which the first COVID-19 vaccines were developed was extraordinary. We have previously looked into the history of vaccine development. The measles vaccine was found relatively rapidly: it took only 10 years from the discovery of the pathogen to the development of the first vaccine. But for typhoid it took more than a century, and for some diseases for which we’ve known the pathogens for more than a century (like malaria) we still haven’t found an effective vaccine. The development of a vaccine against COVID-19 has been much faster than the development of any other vaccine. Within less than a year several successful vaccines have already been announced and were approved for use in some countries. The hope is that even more manufacturers develop vaccines for COVID-19. This will be important because eventually a very large share of the world population needs to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We are on the way to several vaccines against COVID-19 – vaccine trackers monitor the progress: Several institutions maintain websites on which they list COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being developed: The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Vaccine Tracker is updated weekly and shows the current stage of each development. WHO Vaccine Tracker – The WHO is tracking the COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are under development. Milken Institute Vaccine Tracker – The Milken Institute publishes, and regularly updates a tracker of possible treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 that scientists are currently working on. New York Times – The NYT tracker includes brief summaries of each development. Source information country by country You can download the full dataset alongside the detailed source descriptions on GitHub. Note that other countries have also started vaccination campaigns—we’ll add them to our maps and charts as soon as numbers are verifiable based on public official sources. We do not include participants in the vaccine arm of clinical trials, as this data is not available for many of the hundreds of trials currently taking place.

This will be important because eventually a very large share of the world population needs to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We are on the way to several vaccines against COVID-19 – vaccine trackers monitor the progress: Several institutions maintain websites on which they list COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being developed: The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Vaccine Tracker is updated weekly and shows the current stage of each development. WHO Vaccine Tracker – The WHO is tracking the COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are under development. Milken Institute Vaccine Tracker – The Milken Institute publishes, and regularly updates a tracker of possible treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 that scientists are currently working on. New York Times – The NYT tracker includes brief summaries of each development. Source information country by country You can download the full dataset alongside the detailed source descriptions on GitHub. Note that other countries have also started vaccination campaigns—we’ll add them to our maps and charts as soon as numbers are verifiable based on public official sources. We do not include participants in the vaccine arm of clinical trials, as this data is not available for many of the hundreds of trials currently taking place.

The Our World in Data COVID vaccination data To bring this pandemic to an end, a large share of the world needs to be immune to the virus. The safest way to achieve this is with a vaccine. Vaccines are a technology that humanity has often relied on in the past to bring down the death toll of infectious diseases. Within less than 12 months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several research teams rose to the challenge and developed vaccines that protect from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Now the challenge is to make these vaccines available to people around the world. It will be key that people in all countries — not just in rich countries — receive the required protection. To track this effort we at Our World in Data are building the international COVID-19 vaccination dataset that we make available on this page. Data sources: at the end of this page you find a detailed list of all our country-specific sources. Open access: as with all of our data, we are making this dataset openly available, so that everyone can check and use the data that we bring together. You find the vaccination data in our daily-updated repository on GitHub. Country-by-country data on COVID-19 vaccinations This page has a number of charts on vaccination.

Click to open interactive version Attitudes to COVID-19 vaccinations The Imperial College London YouGov Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub gathers global insights on people’s behaviors in response to COVID-19. This survey covers public behaviors and attitudes ranging from mask-wearing to self-isolation, social distancing, symptoms and testing. The following chart shows monthly data on public willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Data represents the share of respondents that agree with the following statement: “If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” Respondents were presented with a 1 to 5 scale, ranging from “Strongly agree” (1) to “Strongly disagree” (5). We consider responses of 1 or 2 to be in agreement with the statement. Click to open interactive version Vaccine development: vaccines approved for use and in clinical trials The speed at which the first COVID-19 vaccines were developed was extraordinary. We have previously looked into the history of vaccine development. The measles vaccine was found relatively rapidly: it took only 10 years from the discovery of the pathogen to the development of the first vaccine. But for typhoid it took more than a century, and for some diseases for which we’ve known the pathogens for more than a century (like malaria) we still haven’t found an effective vaccine. The development of a vaccine against COVID-19 has been much faster than the development of any other vaccine. Within less than a year several successful vaccines have already been announced and were approved for use in some countries. The hope is that even more manufacturers develop vaccines for COVID-19.

Data represents the share of respondents that agree with the following statement: “If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” Respondents were presented with a 1 to 5 scale, ranging from “Strongly agree” (1) to “Strongly disagree” (5). We consider responses of 1 or 2 to be in agreement with the statement. Click to open interactive version Vaccine development: vaccines approved for use and in clinical trials The speed at which the first COVID-19 vaccines were developed was extraordinary. We have previously looked into the history of vaccine development. The measles vaccine was found relatively rapidly: it took only 10 years from the discovery of the pathogen to the development of the first vaccine. But for typhoid it took more than a century, and for some diseases for which we’ve known the pathogens for more than a century (like malaria) we still haven’t found an effective vaccine. The development of a vaccine against COVID-19 has been much faster than the development of any other vaccine. Within less than a year several successful vaccines have already been announced and were approved for use in some countries. The hope is that even more manufacturers develop vaccines for COVID-19. This will be important because eventually a very large share of the world population needs to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We are on the way to several vaccines against COVID-19 – vaccine trackers monitor the progress: Several institutions maintain websites on which they list COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being developed: The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Vaccine Tracker is updated weekly and shows the current stage of each development. WHO Vaccine Tracker – The WHO is tracking the COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are under development. Milken Institute Vaccine Tracker – The Milken Institute publishes, and regularly updates a tracker of possible treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 that scientists are currently working on. New York Times – The NYT tracker includes brief summaries of each development. Source information country by country You can download the full dataset alongside the detailed source descriptions on GitHub. Note that other countries may have also started vaccination campaigns—we’ll add them to our maps and charts as soon as numbers are verifiable based on public official sources. We do not include participants in the vaccine arm of clinical trials, as this data is not available for many of the hundreds of trials currently taking place. The population estimates we use to calculate per-capita metrics are all based on the last revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects. The exact values can be viewed in our GitHub repository.

Growth slowed from 2.2% per year 50 years ago to 1.05% per year today. When and why did the world population grow? And how does rapid population growth come to an end? World Population Growth The UN projects that the global population will be 10.8 billion by 2100. The population growth rate is then expected to be close to zero. What can we expect for the future? What determines how large or small the world population will be? Future Population Growth The global median age increased from 22 years in 1970 to 31 years. 26% of the world are younger than 14 years. 8% are older than 65. What is the age profile of populations around the world? How did it change and what will the age structure of populations look like in the future? Age Structure In some countries gender discrimination leads to skewed sex ratios at birth. How does the number of men and women differ between countries? And why? Gender Ratio Life and death The global average life expectancy is 73 years. The global inequality is large. When and why did the average age at which people die increase and how can we make further progress against early death? Life Expectancy 5.5 million children younger than five die every year. The global child mortality rate is 3.9%. Why are children dying and what can be done to prevent it? Child and Infant Mortality The global average fertility rate is 2.5 children per woman.

We provide a global overview of the prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Mental Health 800,000 die from suicide per year. 58% are younger than 50 years old. Every suicide is a tragedy. But they can be prevented. Suicide Health risks 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 8.1 million people die prematurely from smoking every year. Half are younger than 70 years old. Tobacco smoking is one of the world’s largest health problems today.

HIV / AIDS 620,000 people die from malaria every year. 57% are children younger than 5 years old. The deadly disease transmitted by mosquitoes is one of the leading causes of death in children. How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years. Pneumonia 40,000 people die from Tetanus every year. Half are children under the age of five. Tetanus is a bacterial infection that leads to painful muscle contractions and possibly death. Tetanus Health institutions and interventions Healthcare funding is essential for good health. Healthcare is key to make progress against poor health. How is it financed? Financing Healthcare 14% of children in the world do not receive basic vaccines. Vaccines are key in making progress against infectious diseases and save millions of lives every year.

What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time?

How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch? Seafood Production Agricultural inputs 26% of the world’s labor force is employed in agriculture. Once the majority of human labor was dedicated to food production. When and how did this change? What is the global distribution of agricultural labor today? Employment in Agriculture 50% of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture How is humanity using the Earth’s land? And how can we decrease our land use so that more land is left for wildlife? Land Use The world produces more than 200 million tonnes of fertilizer each year. Fertilizers supply plants with nutrients that are essential for growth. How important are fertilizers? How does their use vary across the world?

Where are they used? What is their impact? Pesticides Energy and Environment Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions? CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution Emissions of ozone-depleting gases have fallen by 98%. But it will take decades for the ozone layer to recover. The emission of ozone-depleting gases are threatening the earth’s ozone layer. Global collaboration and regulation aims to reduce the emissions. Are these efforts successful?

HIV / AIDS 620,000 people die from malaria every year. 57% are children younger than 5 years old. The deadly disease transmitted by mosquitoes is one of the leading causes of death in children. How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years.

Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact?

What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time? And what are the health impacts? Alcohol Consumption Food Production The world produces more than enough food for everyone. But it's unequally distributed across the world. How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch? Seafood Production Agricultural inputs 26% of the world’s labor force is employed in agriculture. Once the majority of human labor was dedicated to food production. When and how did this change? What is the global distribution of agricultural labor today? Employment in Agriculture 50% of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture How is humanity using the Earth’s land?

Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time? And what are the health impacts? Alcohol Consumption Food Production The world produces more than enough food for everyone. But it's unequally distributed across the world. How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

What can we do to prevent biodiversity loss? Biodiversity Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste.

There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years.

What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact?

Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact?

Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

Teaching Hub Slides, research, and visualizations for teaching and learning about global development All our articles on global problems and global changes Demographic Change Population change The world population increased from 1 billion in 1800 to 7.8 billion today. Growth slowed from 2.2% per year 50 years ago to 1.05% per year today. When and why did the world population grow? And how does rapid population growth come to an end? World Population Growth The UN projects that the global population will be 10.8 billion by 2100. The population growth rate is then expected to be close to zero. What can we expect for the future? What determines how large or small the world population will be? Future Population Growth The global median age increased from 22 years in 1970 to 31 years. 26% of the world are younger than 14 years. 8% are older than 65. What is the age profile of populations around the world? How did it change and what will the age structure of populations look like in the future? Age Structure In some countries gender discrimination leads to skewed sex ratios at birth. How does the number of men and women differ between countries? And why? Gender Ratio Life and death The global average life expectancy is 73 years. The global inequality is large. When and why did the average age at which people die increase and how can we make further progress against early death? Life Expectancy 5.5 million children younger than five die every year. The global child mortality rate is 3.9%. Why are children dying and what can be done to prevent it? Child and Infant Mortality The global average fertility rate is 2.5 children per woman. In the last 50 years this rate has halved. How does the number of children vary across the world and over time? What is driving the rapid global change? Fertility Rate Distribution of the World Population 55% of the world population live in urban areas. In 1960 it was 34%. The world population is moving to cities. Why is urbanization happening and what are the consequences? Urbanization Health The global average life expectancy is 73 years. The global inequality is large.

Maternal Mortality The world has seen great improvements in health. But there are still large inequalities. An overview of our research on global health. Global Health 56 million people die every year. What do they die from? How did the causes of death change over time? Causes of Death The global burden of disease is large. Per year 2.5 billion healthy life years are lost due to diseases, accidents, and premature deaths How is the burden of disease distributed and how did it change over time? Burden of Disease 9.6 million people die from cancer every year. 54% are younger than 70 years old. Cancers are one of the leading causes of death globally. Are we making progress against cancer? Cancer An estimated 792 million people have a mental health disorder. We provide a global overview of the prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Mental Health 800,000 die from suicide per year. 58% are younger than 50 years old. Every suicide is a tragedy. But they can be prevented. Suicide Health risks 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 8.1 million people die prematurely from smoking every year. Half are younger than 70 years old. Tobacco smoking is one of the world’s largest health problems today. Smoking 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time? And what are the health impacts? Alcohol Consumption 11.8 million people die prematurely from drug use every year. This includes tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use.

Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) 1 million people die from HIV/AIDS each year. 84% are younger than 50 years old. A global epidemic and the leading cause of death in some countries. HIV / AIDS 620,000 people die from malaria every year. 57% are children younger than 5 years old. The deadly disease transmitted by mosquitoes is one of the leading causes of death in children. How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years. Pneumonia 40,000 people die from Tetanus every year. Half are children under the age of five. Tetanus is a bacterial infection that leads to painful muscle contractions and possibly death. Tetanus Health institutions and interventions Healthcare funding is essential for good health. Healthcare is key to make progress against poor health. How is it financed? Financing Healthcare 14% of children in the world do not receive basic vaccines. Vaccines are key in making progress against infectious diseases and save millions of lives every year. Vaccination Food and Agriculture Nutrition 11% of the world population – 820 million people – are undernourished. 22% of children younger than five are ‘stunted’. What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time? And what are the health impacts? Alcohol Consumption Food Production The world produces more than enough food for everyone. But it's unequally distributed across the world. How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch? Seafood Production Agricultural inputs 26% of the world’s labor force is employed in agriculture. Once the majority of human labor was dedicated to food production. When and how did this change? What is the global distribution of agricultural labor today? Employment in Agriculture 50% of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture How is humanity using the Earth’s land? And how can we decrease our land use so that more land is left for wildlife? Land Use The world produces more than 200 million tonnes of fertilizer each year. Fertilizers supply plants with nutrients that are essential for growth. How important are fertilizers? How does their use vary across the world? Fertilizers Pesticides are often used to protect crop yields. There are large differences in its use across the world. Pesticides are used to protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects. Where are they used? What is their impact? Pesticides Energy and Environment Explore the diversity of wildlife across the planet. What are species threatened with? What can we do to prevent biodiversity loss? Biodiversity Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions? CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution Emissions of ozone-depleting gases have fallen by 98%. But it will take decades for the ozone layer to recover. The emission of ozone-depleting gases are threatening the earth’s ozone layer. Global collaboration and regulation aims to reduce the emissions. Are these efforts successful?

Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact?

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

Vaccination Food and Agriculture Nutrition 11% of the world population – 820 million people – are undernourished. 22% of children younger than five are ‘stunted’. What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time? And what are the health impacts? Alcohol Consumption Food Production The world produces more than enough food for everyone. But it's unequally distributed across the world. How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

HIV / AIDS 620,000 people die from malaria every year. 57% are children younger than 5 years old. The deadly disease transmitted by mosquitoes is one of the leading causes of death in children. How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years. Pneumonia 40,000 people die from Tetanus every year. Half are children under the age of five. Tetanus is a bacterial infection that leads to painful muscle contractions and possibly death. Tetanus Health institutions and interventions Healthcare funding is essential for good health. Healthcare is key to make progress against poor health. How is it financed?

What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time?

What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

What is the global distribution of agricultural labor today? Employment in Agriculture 50% of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture How is humanity using the Earth’s land? And how can we decrease our land use so that more land is left for wildlife? Land Use The world produces more than 200 million tonnes of fertilizer each year. Fertilizers supply plants with nutrients that are essential for growth. How important are fertilizers? How does their use vary across the world? Fertilizers Pesticides are often used to protect crop yields. There are large differences in its use across the world. Pesticides are used to protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects. Where are they used? What is their impact? Pesticides Energy and Environment Explore the diversity of wildlife across the planet. What are species threatened with? What can we do to prevent biodiversity loss? Biodiversity Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions? CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution Emissions of ozone-depleting gases have fallen by 98%. But it will take decades for the ozone layer to recover. The emission of ozone-depleting gases are threatening the earth’s ozone layer. Global collaboration and regulation aims to reduce the emissions. Are these efforts successful? Ozone Layer Water Explore global access to clean water and sanitation. Clean Water and Sanitation 2.1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water. That's 29% of the world population.

The Our World in Data COVID vaccination data To bring this pandemic to an end, a large share of the world needs to be immune to the virus. The safest way to achieve this is with a vaccine. Vaccines are a technology that humanity has often relied on in the past to bring down the death toll of infectious diseases. Within less than 12 months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several research teams rose to the challenge and developed vaccines that protect from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Now the challenge is to make these vaccines available to people around the world. It will be key that people in all countries — not just in rich countries — receive the required protection. To track this effort we at Our World in Data are building the international COVID-19 vaccination dataset that we make available on this page. It is updated each morning, with the most recent official numbers up to the previous day. Data sources: at the end of this page you find a detailed list of all our country-specific sources. Open access: as with all of our data, we are making this dataset openly available, so that everyone can check and use the data that we bring together. You find the vaccination data in our daily-updated repository on GitHub.

None selected Select countries What share of the population has been partly or fully vaccinated against COVID-19? The following charts show the breakdown of vaccinations by those that have been partly or fully vaccinated. A person is considered partly vaccinated if they have received only one dose of a 2-dose vaccine protocol. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have received a single-dose vaccine or both doses of a two-dose vaccine. This data is only available for countries which report the breakdown of doses administered by first and second doses. How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are administered daily? Daily number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered per 100 people The following chart shows the daily number of COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people ( check the latest global vaccination rate). This is shown as the rolling seven-day average. Note that this is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses).

This is provided as three metrics: the share that have received at least one dose; the share that have been fully vaccinated; and the share that are only partly vaccinated. Some of this data is only available for countries which report the breakdown of doses administered by first and second doses by age. Share that have received at least one dose by age The following chart shows the share of the population in each age group that have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This metric includes those that are either partly or fully vaccinated. Click to open interactive version Fully vaccinated by age The following chart shows the share of the population in each age group that are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. This represents the share that have received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. Click to open interactive version Partly vaccinated by age The following chart shows the share of the population in each age group that are only partly vaccinated against COVID-19. For a two-dose vaccine schedule, this would be people that have received only one dose. Those who are fully vaccinated are not included. This means this metric will decrease as people receive their second dose. Click to open interactive version Which vaccines have been administered in each country? The following chart shows the cumulative number of doses administered, broken down by vaccine manufacturer. This is only available for a select number of countries which report the necessary data. Click to open interactive version Vaccination policies This interactive chart maps government policies on COVID-19 vaccination. Note that this only tracks policies on the availability of vaccinations. It does not track the number of people who have been vaccinated. Countries are grouped into six categories: No availability Availability for ONE of following: key workers/ clinically vulnerable groups / elderly groups Availability for TWO of following: key workers/ clinically vulnerable groups / elderly groups Availability for ALL of following: key workers/ clinically vulnerable groups / elderly groups Availability for all three plus partial additional availability (select broad groups/ages) Universal availability Vaccination policy data is sourced from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker This data on vaccination policies is sourced from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). This resource is published by researchers at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford: Thomas Hale, Anna Petherik, Beatriz Kira, Noam Angrist, Toby Phillips and Samuel Webster. The tracker presents data collected from public sources by a team of over one hundred Oxford University students and staff from every part of the world. The data presented here is taken directly from the OxCGRT project; Our World in Data do not track policy responses ourselves, and do not make additions to the tracker dataset. These charts are regularly updated based on the latest version of the response tracker. OxCGRT is an ongoing collation project of live data. If you see any inaccuracies in the underlying data, or for specific feedback on the analysis or another aspect of the project please contact OxCGRT team. See the tracker’s notes and guidance on data quality. Click to open interactive version Attitudes to COVID-19 vaccinations The Imperial College London YouGov Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub gathers global insights on people’s behaviors in response to COVID-19. This survey covers public behaviors and attitudes ranging from mask-wearing to self-isolation, social distancing, symptoms and testing. The following two charts show monthly data from this survey on the willingness of people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Survey respondents were presented with the following statement: “If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” Respondents were asked to react to this statement on a 1 to 5 scale, ranging from “Strongly agree” (1) to “Strongly disagree” (5). Based on this scale, we consider respondents to be willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine if they selected 1 or 2, unwilling to get a COVID-19 vaccine if they selected 4 or 5, and uncertain if they are willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine if they selected 3. Both charts below show the share of a country’s population that has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in comparison to the share of the population that is unvaccinated, where the share of the unvaccinated population is separated into those who would be willing vs. unwilling vs. uncertain if they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it was made available to them this week.1 The first chart shows this data for a single country over time, while the second chart shows the same data for multiple countries at a single point in time. Click to open interactive version Click to open interactive version Vaccine development: vaccines approved for use and in clinical trials The speed at which the first COVID-19 vaccines were developed was extraordinary. We have previously looked into the history of vaccine development. The measles vaccine was found relatively rapidly: it took only 10 years from the discovery of the pathogen to the development of the first vaccine. But for typhoid it took more than a century, and for some diseases for which we’ve known the pathogens for more than a century (like malaria) we still haven’t found an effective vaccine. The development of a vaccine against COVID-19 has been much faster than the development of any other vaccine. Within less than a year several successful vaccines have already been announced and were approved for use in some countries. The hope is that even more manufacturers develop vaccines for COVID-19. This will be important because eventually a very large share of the world population needs to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We are on the way to several vaccines against COVID-19 – vaccine trackers monitor the progress: Several institutions maintain websites on which they list COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being developed: The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Vaccine Tracker is updated weekly and shows the current stage of each development. WHO Vaccine Tracker – The WHO is tracking the COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are under development. Milken Institute Vaccine Tracker – The Milken Institute publishes, and regularly updates a tracker of possible treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 that scientists are currently working on. New York Times – The NYT tracker includes brief summaries of each development. Source information country by country You can download the full dataset alongside the detailed sources on GitHub.

Sinopharm/Beijing Zimbabwe Ministry of Health Jul. 22, 2021 Sinopharm/Beijing Frequently-asked questions Which population data are the per-capita metrics based on? The population estimates we use come from the United Nations World Population Prospects. We use this data for its reliability, its consistent methods, and because it makes our work much easier. The exact values can be viewed in our GitHub repository. The United Nations estimates may not always reflect the latest censuses or national figures—but there are several reasons why we use this data over country-by-country national population estimates. The UNWPP dataset is the standard in research. The main reason is that it uses a reliable and standardized methodology for all countries. For example, if we used individual country data, some may include overseas workers, expats, undocumented immigrants, etc. but others wouldn’t. Using data from the UN allows us to get accurate population estimates for all territories in the world very easily. Finding and maintaining estimates based on national censuses would be very time-consuming for our small team, without bringing much additional value to our work. Other reasons include the availability of yearly data (national censuses are only conducted every few years), and avoiding double-counting in cases of border disputes. For all these reasons, the UN data is the best solution to bring accurate per-capita metrics to our COVID data. Can the value of per-capita metrics exceed 100%? The population estimates we use to calculate per-capita metrics are all based on the last revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects. The United Nations estimates may not always reflect the latest censuses or national figures. Additionally, it’s important to bear in mind that in some territories, vaccination coverage may include non-residents (such as tourists and foreign workers). For these reasons, per-capita metrics may sometimes exceed 100%. What is the definition of a fully-vaccinated person? In our data, fully-vaccinated people are those who have received all doses prescribed by their vaccination regimen (e.g. 2 doses for Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca, etc. and 1 dose for Johnson & Johnson, CanSino, etc.). Some countries also allow for alternative definitions, such as having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past and having received 1 dose of a two-dose regimen. We currently ignore these alternative definitions to preserve the common definition of fully vaccinated, i.e. all doses required in the vaccine regimen. This allows for an optimal comparability between countries. How can we best estimate how many people have been vaccinated globally? Because some countries — notably China, as of June 2021 — do not report breakdowns between first and second doses administered, we cannot know the exact number of people with at least 1 dose and people fully vaccinated in the world. The figures displayed on our charts for “World” only include data from countries that do publish this more precise information. Therefore, as long as some countries are only reporting partial data, these figures will underestimate the real number of people vaccinated and fully vaccinated globally. Based on the number of doses administered, it is however possible to calculate a lower and upper bound of how many people have been vaccinated in these countries. For example, if 500 million doses have been used in China, they must have been administered to at least 250 million people (with 2 doses each), and up to 500 million people (with only 1 dose each). We recommend citing the figure on our charts as the “confirmed number of people with at least 1 dose”. A good proxy for estimating the “complete number of people with at least 1 dose” is: [confirmed number of people with at least 1 dose] + ([total doses administered in China] / 2) as a lower-bound estimate; [confirmed number of people with at least 1 dose] + [total doses administered in China] as a higher-bound estimate. My country has started vaccinating its population. Why is it missing from the charts? Other countries that are not shown in our data may have also started vaccination campaigns. We’ll add them to our maps and charts as soon as numbers are verifiable based on public official sources. If you’re aware of an official source reporting numbers, please let us know using the “Feedback” button at the bottom of your screen. Are participants in vaccine clinical trials included in your data? We do not include participants in the vaccine arm of clinical trials, as this data is not available for many of the hundreds of trials currently taking place. How do you report vaccinations performed in Israel and Palestine? In our dataset and charts on COVID-19 vaccinations, we report vaccinations performed in Israel and Palestine separately. The vaccination data is needed to understand how the pandemic is evolving. For this it is key to bring together the vaccination data with data on COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths. Global health institutions that report on the pandemic are reporting these metrics separately: The World Health Organization reports the measures for Israel separately from Palestine in its data. Johns Hopkins University also reports Israel separately from Palestine in its data on cases & deaths of COVID-19, which has been used worldwide in the last year. Reporting the data for Palestine and Israel separately also allows us to show their respective reported vaccination levels. It makes clear what the respective vaccination levels are, as reported by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Finally, our dataset on COVID-19 vaccinations is sourced from official data published by governments and ministries of health from countries around the world. This is also the case for Israel and Palestine. We show figures for Palestine and Israel separately, as they are reported separately by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Populations Division of the United Nations reports population figures for countries around the world, and we are relying on their latest data (from their 2019 revision) for countries around the world of. They report a population of 8,655,541 people for Israel and a population of 5,101,416 people for Palestine. The resulting shares of people vaccinated in Israel and Palestine can be seen in our COVID-19 Data Explorer.

For this reason, these estimates do not represent individuals under 18 years of age, and therefore may not accurately reflect the willingness or unwillingness of a country’s population of all ages to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Nevertheless, we expect these differences to be minor.

Burden of Disease 9.6 million people die from cancer every year. 54% are younger than 70 years old. Cancers are one of the leading causes of death globally. Are we making progress against cancer? Cancer An estimated 792 million people have a mental health disorder. We provide a global overview of the prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, and schizophrenia. Mental Health 800,000 die from suicide per year. 58% are younger than 50 years old. Every suicide is a tragedy. But they can be prevented. Suicide Health risks 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 8.1 million people die prematurely from smoking every year. Half are younger than 70 years old. Tobacco smoking is one of the world’s largest health problems today. Smoking 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time? And what are the health impacts? Alcohol Consumption 11.8 million people die prematurely from drug use every year. This includes tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use. Drug use – which includes smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use is one of the world’s largest health problems today. Drug Use 590,000 people die prematurely from illicit drug use every year. 42% are younger than 50 years old. How common is the use and addiction to opioids, cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis? What is the impact? Opioids, cocaine, cannabis and illicit drugs Infectious diseases COVID-19 developed into a global pandemic. Country-by-country data and research on the pandemic. Updated daily. Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) 1 million people die from HIV/AIDS each year. 84% are younger than 50 years old. A global epidemic and the leading cause of death in some countries. HIV / AIDS 620,000 people die from malaria every year. 57% are children younger than 5 years old. The deadly disease transmitted by mosquitoes is one of the leading causes of death in children. How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years. Pneumonia 40,000 people die from Tetanus every year. Half are children under the age of five. Tetanus is a bacterial infection that leads to painful muscle contractions and possibly death. Tetanus Health institutions and interventions Healthcare funding is essential for good health. Healthcare is key to make progress against poor health. How is it financed? Financing Healthcare 14% of children in the world do not receive basic vaccines. Vaccines are key in making progress against infectious diseases and save millions of lives every year. Vaccination Food and Agriculture Nutrition 11% of the world population – 820 million people – are undernourished. 22% of children younger than five are ‘stunted’. What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time? And what are the health impacts? Alcohol Consumption Food Production The world produces more than enough food for everyone. But it's unequally distributed across the world. How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch? Seafood Production Agricultural inputs 26% of the world’s labor force is employed in agriculture. Once the majority of human labor was dedicated to food production. When and how did this change? What is the global distribution of agricultural labor today? Employment in Agriculture 50% of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture How is humanity using the Earth’s land? And how can we decrease our land use so that more land is left for wildlife? Land Use The world produces more than 200 million tonnes of fertilizer each year. Fertilizers supply plants with nutrients that are essential for growth. How important are fertilizers? How does their use vary across the world? Fertilizers Pesticides are often used to protect crop yields. There are large differences in its use across the world. Pesticides are used to protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects. Where are they used? What is their impact? Pesticides Energy and Environment Explore the diversity of wildlife across the planet. What are species threatened with? What can we do to prevent biodiversity loss? Biodiversity Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions? CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution Emissions of ozone-depleting gases have fallen by 98%. But it will take decades for the ozone layer to recover. The emission of ozone-depleting gases are threatening the earth’s ozone layer. Global collaboration and regulation aims to reduce the emissions. Are these efforts successful? Ozone Layer Water Explore global access to clean water and sanitation. Clean Water and Sanitation 2.1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water. That's 29% of the world population. Clean and safe water is essential for good health. How did access change over time? Where do people lack access? Clean Water 4.5 billion people do not have access to safely managed sanitation. That's 60% of the world population. Access to safe sanitation is essential for reducing deaths from infectious disease, preventing malnutrition and providing dignity. What is the global situation today and how can we make progress? Sanitation Globally we use 70% of freshwater withdrawals for agriculture; 19% in industry; and 11% in households. Freshwater resources across the world are the focus of this entry. How much water do we use? How did it change over time? Water Use and Stress Land and Ecosystems 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production 30.8% of the world’s land area is forested. How are forests distributed across the world? How much do we lose to deforestation every year? Forests and Deforestation 50% of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture How is humanity using the Earth’s land? And how can we decrease our land use so that more land is left for wildlife? Land Use Over the last decade the annual number of deaths due to natural disasters was 45,000 globally.

The Our World in Data COVID vaccination data To bring this pandemic to an end, a large share of the world needs to be immune to the virus. The safest way to achieve this is with a vaccine. Vaccines are a technology that humanity has often relied on in the past to bring down the death toll of infectious diseases. Within less than 12 months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several research teams rose to the challenge and developed vaccines that protect from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Now the challenge is to make these vaccines available to people around the world. It will be key that people in all countries — not just in rich countries — receive the required protection. To track this effort we at Our World in Data are building the international COVID-19 vaccination dataset that we make available on this page. It is updated each morning, with the most recent official numbers up to the previous day. Data sources: at the end of this page you find a detailed list of all our country-specific sources. Open access: as with all of our data, we are making this dataset openly available, so that everyone can check and use the data that we bring together.

None selected Select countries What share of the population has been partly or fully vaccinated against COVID-19? The following charts show the breakdown of vaccinations by those that have been partly or fully vaccinated. A person is considered partly vaccinated if they have received only one dose of a 2-dose vaccine protocol. A person is considered fully vaccinated if they have received a single-dose vaccine or both doses of a two-dose vaccine. This data is only available for countries which report the breakdown of doses administered by first and second doses. How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are administered daily? Daily number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered per 100 people The following chart shows the daily number of COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people. This is shown as the rolling seven-day average.

This is provided as three metrics: the share that have received at least one dose; the share that have been fully vaccinated; and the share that are only partly vaccinated. Some of this data is only available for countries which report the breakdown of doses administered by first and second doses by age. Share that have received at least one dose by age The following chart shows the share of the population in each age group that have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This metric includes those that are either partly or fully vaccinated.

This represents the share that have received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. Click to open interactive version Partly vaccinated by age The following chart shows the share of the population in each age group that are only partly vaccinated against COVID-19. For a two-dose vaccine schedule, this would be people that have received only one dose. Those who are fully vaccinated are not included. This means this metric will decrease as people receive their second dose. Click to open interactive version Which vaccines have been administered in each country?

This resource is published by researchers at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford: Thomas Hale, Anna Petherik, Beatriz Kira, Noam Angrist, Toby Phillips and Samuel Webster. The tracker presents data collected from public sources by a team of over one hundred Oxford University students and staff from every part of the world. The data presented here is taken directly from the OxCGRT project; Our World in Data do not track policy responses ourselves, and do not make additions to the tracker dataset. These charts are regularly updated based on the latest version of the response tracker. OxCGRT is an ongoing collation project of live data. If you see any inaccuracies in the underlying data, or for specific feedback on the analysis or another aspect of the project please contact OxCGRT team. See the tracker’s notes and guidance on data quality. Click to open interactive version Attitudes to COVID-19 vaccinations The Imperial College London YouGov Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub gathers global insights on people’s behaviors in response to COVID-19. This survey covers public behaviors and attitudes ranging from mask-wearing to self-isolation, social distancing, symptoms and testing. The following two charts show monthly data from this survey on the willingness of people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Survey respondents were presented with the following statement: “If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” Respondents were asked to react to this statement on a 1 to 5 scale, ranging from “Strongly agree” (1) to “Strongly disagree” (5). Based on this scale, we consider respondents to be willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine if they selected 1 or 2, unwilling to get a COVID-19 vaccine if they selected 4 or 5, and uncertain if they are willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine if they selected 3. Both charts below show the share of a country’s population that has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in comparison to the share of the population that is unvaccinated, where the share of the unvaccinated population is separated into those who would be willing vs. unwilling vs. uncertain if they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it was made available to them this week.1 The first chart shows this data for a single country over time, while the second chart shows the same data for multiple countries at a single point in time. Click to open interactive version Click to open interactive version Vaccine development: vaccines approved for use and in clinical trials The speed at which the first COVID-19 vaccines were developed was extraordinary. We have previously looked into the history of vaccine development. The measles vaccine was found relatively rapidly: it took only 10 years from the discovery of the pathogen to the development of the first vaccine. But for typhoid it took more than a century, and for some diseases for which we’ve known the pathogens for more than a century (like malaria) we still haven’t found an effective vaccine. The development of a vaccine against COVID-19 has been much faster than the development of any other vaccine. Within less than a year several successful vaccines have already been announced and were approved for use in some countries. The hope is that even more manufacturers develop vaccines for COVID-19. This will be important because eventually a very large share of the world population needs to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We are on the way to several vaccines against COVID-19 – vaccine trackers monitor the progress: Several institutions maintain websites on which they list COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being developed: The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Vaccine Tracker is updated weekly and shows the current stage of each development. WHO Vaccine Tracker – The WHO is tracking the COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are under development. Milken Institute Vaccine Tracker – The Milken Institute publishes, and regularly updates a tracker of possible treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 that scientists are currently working on. New York Times – The NYT tracker includes brief summaries of each development. Source information country by country You can download the full dataset alongside the detailed sources on GitHub.

Sinopharm/Beijing Zimbabwe Ministry of Health Jul. 28, 2021 Sinopharm/Beijing, Sinovac, Sputnik V Frequently-asked questions Which population data are the per-capita metrics based on? The population estimates we use come from the United Nations World Population Prospects. We use this data for its reliability, its consistent methods, and because it makes our work much easier. The exact values can be viewed in our GitHub repository. The United Nations estimates may not always reflect the latest censuses or national figures—but there are several reasons why we use this data over country-by-country national population estimates. The UNWPP dataset is the standard in research. The main reason is that it uses a reliable and standardized methodology for all countries. For example, if we used individual country data, some may include overseas workers, expats, undocumented immigrants, etc. but others wouldn’t. Using data from the UN allows us to get accurate population estimates for all territories in the world very easily. Finding and maintaining estimates based on national censuses would be very time-consuming for our small team, without bringing much additional value to our work. Other reasons include the availability of yearly data (national censuses are only conducted every few years), and avoiding double-counting in cases of border disputes. For all these reasons, the UN data is the best solution to bring accurate per-capita metrics to our COVID data. Can the value of per-capita metrics exceed 100%? The population estimates we use to calculate per-capita metrics are all based on the last revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects. The United Nations estimates may not always reflect the latest censuses or national figures. Additionally, it’s important to bear in mind that in some territories, vaccination coverage may include non-residents (such as tourists and foreign workers). For these reasons, per-capita metrics may sometimes exceed 100%. What is the definition of a fully-vaccinated person? In our data, fully-vaccinated people are those who have received all doses prescribed by their vaccination regimen (e.g. 2 doses for Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca, etc. and 1 dose for Johnson & Johnson, CanSino, etc.). Some countries also allow for alternative definitions, such as having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past and having received 1 dose of a two-dose regimen. We currently ignore these alternative definitions to preserve the common definition of fully vaccinated, i.e. all doses required in the vaccine regimen. This allows for an optimal comparability between countries. How can we best estimate how many people have been vaccinated globally? Because some countries — notably China, as of June 2021 — do not report breakdowns between first and second doses administered, we cannot know the exact number of people with at least 1 dose and people fully vaccinated in the world. The figures displayed on our charts for “World” only include data from countries that do publish this more precise information. Therefore, as long as some countries are only reporting partial data, these figures will underestimate the real number of people vaccinated and fully vaccinated globally. Based on the number of doses administered, it is however possible to calculate a lower and upper bound of how many people have been vaccinated in these countries. For example, if 500 million doses have been used in China, they must have been administered to at least 250 million people (with 2 doses each), and up to 500 million people (with only 1 dose each). We recommend citing the figure on our charts as the “confirmed number of people with at least 1 dose”. A good proxy for estimating the “complete number of people with at least 1 dose” is: [confirmed number of people with at least 1 dose] + ([total doses administered in China] / 2) as a lower-bound estimate; [confirmed number of people with at least 1 dose] + [total doses administered in China] as a higher-bound estimate. My country has started vaccinating its population. Why is it missing from the charts? Other countries that are not shown in our data may have also started vaccination campaigns. We’ll add them to our maps and charts as soon as numbers are verifiable based on public official sources. If you’re aware of an official source reporting numbers, please let us know using the “Feedback” button at the bottom of your screen. Are participants in vaccine clinical trials included in your data? We do not include participants in the vaccine arm of clinical trials, as this data is not available for many of the hundreds of trials currently taking place. How do you report vaccinations performed in Israel and Palestine? In our dataset and charts on COVID-19 vaccinations, we report vaccinations performed in Israel and Palestine separately. The vaccination data is needed to understand how the pandemic is evolving. For this it is key to bring together the vaccination data with data on COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths. Global health institutions that report on the pandemic are reporting these metrics separately: The World Health Organization reports the measures for Israel separately from Palestine in its data. Johns Hopkins University also reports Israel separately from Palestine in its data on cases & deaths of COVID-19, which has been used worldwide in the last year. Reporting the data for Palestine and Israel separately also allows us to show their respective reported vaccination levels. It makes clear what the respective vaccination levels are, as reported by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Finally, our dataset on COVID-19 vaccinations is sourced from official data published by governments and ministries of health from countries around the world. This is also the case for Israel and Palestine. We show figures for Palestine and Israel separately, as they are reported separately by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Populations Division of the United Nations reports population figures for countries around the world, and we are relying on their latest data (from their 2019 revision) for countries around the world of. They report a population of 8,655,541 people for Israel and a population of 5,101,416 people for Palestine. The resulting shares of people vaccinated in Israel and Palestine can be seen in our COVID-19 Data Explorer.

For this reason, these estimates do not represent individuals under 18 years of age, and therefore may not accurately reflect the willingness or unwillingness of a country’s population of all ages to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Nevertheless, we expect these differences to be minor.

There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time?

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?

Humans are capable of atrocious cruelty – the history of war makes this all too clear. How many died in war? And what are the prospects for making the world more peaceful? War and Peace Annual military spending amounts to 2.2% of global GDP. How much do different countries spent on their military? How did it change over time? Military Spending Over the last decade the annual number of deaths due to terrorism was 22,000 globally. The attacks of terrorists receive a lot of attention from the media and often dominate the public discourse. How many people die from these attacks and how did it change over time? Terrorism The world’s nuclear powers have more than 10,000 nuclear warheads. The world’s nuclear powers possess in total 10,145 nuclear warheads. These weapons have the capacity to kill hundreds of millions of people directly, and billions due to subsequent effects on agriculture. Nuclear Weapons Peacekeeping operations are used in conflict prevention, but are not always successful. Peacekeeping aims to help countries transition from conflict towards peace. How have peacekeeping operations and forces changed over time? See global data on peacekeeping activities. Peacekeeping Targeted killing of specific societal groups have killed millions. The organized killings targeted at particular groups for their ethnicity, religion or political belief killed many millions.

Suicide Health risks 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Air Pollution 3.4 million people die prematurely from outdoor air pollution every year. 43% are younger than 70 years old. Outdoor air pollution is one of the world’s largest health and environmental problems. Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest.

How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years.

Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time?

How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

Fertilizers supply plants with nutrients that are essential for growth. How important are fertilizers? How does their use vary across the world? Fertilizers Pesticides are often used to protect crop yields. There are large differences in its use across the world. Pesticides are used to protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects. Where are they used? What is their impact? Pesticides Energy and Environment Explore the diversity of wildlife across the planet. What are species threatened with? What can we do to prevent biodiversity loss? Biodiversity Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

How did we eliminate the disease in some world regions and how can we continue progress against malaria? Malaria Humanity has already eradicated one severe disease. Which ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how? Eradication of Diseases 1.6 million people die from diarrheal diseases every year. One-third are children under five years old. Diarrheal diseases are one of the leading cause of child deaths while they are largely preventable. How can we continue to make progress against these diseases? Diarrheal diseases In the past smallpox killed millions every year. Humanity eradicated this infectious disease globally. How was this possible? Smallpox One generation ago polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Now the world can possibly eradicate it: polio remains endemic in only 2 countries. Polio 2.6 million people die from pneumonia every year. One-third are children younger than five years old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death for children younger than 5 years.

What are the consequences of undernourishment and how can we make progress against hunger and undernourishment? Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time?

How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

Transport Climate Change Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions?

Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution Emissions of ozone-depleting gases have fallen by 98%. But it will take decades for the ozone layer to recover. The emission of ozone-depleting gases are threatening the earth’s ozone layer. Global collaboration and regulation aims to reduce the emissions. Are these efforts successful?

Hunger and Undernourishment Around 130 million people died in famines during the last 150 years. This estimate is based on our historical reconstructions. In many parts of the world famines have been common in the past. What causes famines? How can famines be averted? Famines 2,884 kcal per day is the global average food supply per person. There are large inequalities in food supply across countries. How had the availability of food changed over time? How does food supply vary across the world today? Food Supply Human height gives us an indicator of changes in health and nutrition in the past. The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally. Obesity is responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths every year. When did obesity increase? How do rates vary across the world? What is the health impact? Obesity 2.8 million people die prematurely from alcohol consumption every year. 74% are younger than 70 years old. Who consumes the most alcohol? How has consumption changed over time?

How much food do countries produce across the world? Agricultural Production 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food production. 50% of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. What are the environmental impacts of food production? How do we reduce the impacts of agriculture on the environment? Environmental impacts of food production Global average cereal yield is 4 tonnes per hectare. But in many regions yields are much lower. Increasing the production of crops per area of land is of key importance for food security, living standards, and decreasing humanity’s impact on the environment. Crop Yields 80 billion animals are slaughtered every year for meat production. Meat is an important source of nutrition for people around the world. How quickly is demand growing? And what are the implications for animal welfare and the earth’s environment? Meat and Dairy Production 33% of global fish stocks are overexploited. Fish and seafood form an important part of people’s diets. How does growing demand affect fish populations? How does production in aquaculture compare with wild catch?

Transport Climate Change Energy 13% of the world do not have access to electricity. 40% do not have access to clean fuels for cooking. Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels are vital for a good standard of living and good health. Access to Energy Global energy production has grown 2.5-fold in the past 50 years. What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time? Oil Spills Air and Climate 36 billion tonnes of CO₂ are emitted every year. Who is emitting greenhouse gases? Which countries and which sectors? And what needs to happen to reduce emissions? CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 5 million people die prematurely from air pollution each year. Our overview on both indoor and outdoor air pollution.

Outdoor Air Pollution 1.6 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution every year. 55% are younger than 70 years old. Indoor air pollution – caused by the burning of firewood, crop waste, and dung for cooking and heating – is a major health risk of the world’s poorest. Indoor Air Pollution Emissions of ozone-depleting gases have fallen by 98%. But it will take decades for the ozone layer to recover. The emission of ozone-depleting gases are threatening the earth’s ozone layer. Global collaboration and regulation aims to reduce the emissions. Are these efforts successful?

The average height of a population can inform us about the nutrition and living conditions of populations in the past for which we have little other data. Human Height An estimated 2 billion people are deficient in essential micronutrients. Food is not only a source of energy and protein, but also micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – which are essential to good health. Who is most affected by the ‘hidden hunger’ of micronutrient deficiency? Micronutrient Deficiency A diverse diet is essential for good nutrition. There are large inequalities in dietary diversity between countries. What do people across the world eat? Diet Compositions Food prices are important for both consumers and farmers. Food needs to be affordable for people, and at the same it is a key source of income for one-quarter of the world’s labor force. Food Prices 13% of adults are obese, globally.

What energy sources does the world rely on? What is this energy used for? And how does it change over time? Energy 5% of global primary energy production comes from modern renewable sources Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. But they’re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. Renewable Energy 86% of global primary energy comes from fossil fuels. Deaths per TWh range from 2.8 for gas to 24.6 for coal. Coal, gas and oil were key to industrialization and rising prosperity, but their large impact on health and the climate mean that we should transition away from these sources of energy. Fossil Fuels Waste It is estimated that 8 million tonnes enter the world’s oceans each year. The use of plastics has many benefits – it is affordable, versatile, resistant, and can help reduce other forms of waste – especially food waste. However, when poorly managed it can pollute the environment and our oceans. Where does the plastic in our oceans come from and what can we do to reduce plastic pollution? Plastic Pollution Oil spills can have a large negative impact on the environment. How often do oil spills happen? How did it change over time?
