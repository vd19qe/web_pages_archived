Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Share this story More News Stories VIRUS DIARY: In South Korea, a daughter’s worry and a test by JUWON PARK, Associated Press / Apr 17, 2020 SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — I’ve always thought I would be prepared to face my mom’s death. I grew up watching her go through a series of illnesses and a medical accident that almost took her life a few years ago. She often speaks of a future without her in it. She’s been rushing me to save up and buy a flat so she can find peace knowing I’ll have a roof over my head. To be frank, she’s not the only one who’s been thinking about a possibility of her sudden absence. I’m a journalist, though. I can handle surprises.

(WIVB) -- Inside Kleinhans Music Hall, the music has temporarily stopped, but things are looking lively again outside the building. HUNT Property Solutions has been working on beautifying the outside of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra's main performance area. In the process of doing this, crews decided to repair the ground lights around the perimeter. Read the Full Article Virus forced schools online, but many students didn’t follow by JULIE WATSON and CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press / Apr 17, 2020 SAN DIEGO (AP) — During the first week that her San Diego public school was shuttered to slow the spread of the coronavirus, not one of Elise Samaniego's students logged on to her virtual classroom. Three weeks in, the teacher still hadn’t connected online with roughly two-thirds of the students in her third- and fourth-grade combo class at Paradise Hills Elementary. She fears the pandemic will exact a devastating toll on education in the United States, especially at low-income schools like hers.

Number of COVID-19 hospitalizations is dropping as NYS on PAUSE extends to May 15 Coronavirus by: Evan Anstey Posted: Apr 16, 2020 / 11:20 AM EDT / Updated: Apr 16, 2020 / 05:35 PM EDT ALBANY, N.Y. (WIVB) — New York appears to be reaching the apex of the coronavirus’ impact, if it’s not already there. This means we’re in the time period when hospitals are being hit the hardest. It’s evidenced by the recent plateau in hospitalizations, which have been staying around 18,000 this week. Thursday’s new numbers were a good sign though. The amount of people hospitalized at a time, including those in intensive care, is slightly down. About 17,700 are currently hospitalized. Just under 2,000 of these people started receiving hospital care on Wednesday. Although the number of people being hospitalized each day has stayed about the same, more are being discharged. The amount of new deaths was lower than previous days’ numbers, too. 606 more lives were lost between Wednesday morning and Thursday. Most of these people were hospitalized, but 29 were in nursing homes — a place Cuomo referred to as “ground zero” for this virus. Still though, the numbers are proof that New York “can control this beast,” as the Governor put it. Since New York received help from other states, Cuomo said that the state will return the favor, announcing Thursday that 100 ventilators will be sent to New Jersey. As the “curve” continues to flatten, and possibly move downward, Cuomo is looking toward the future — not just preparing for new cases, but “re-opening” New York. In terms of the end of this, Cuomo says that will be when we have a vaccine. The infection rate can’t be tracked, but the hospitalization rate is helping the state determine how soon New York will “re-open.” New York has a population of roughly 19 million. Over a month’s time, the state has done more testing than any other in the nation so far, with more than 500,000 tests. That’s more than California, Michigan and Florida combined. The state is beginning antibody testing this week. First responders, healthcare workers and essential workers will be given the top priority. “The more testing, the more open the economy,” Cuomo said, noting that additional federal funding is needed to bring more testing, as well as more testing methods, to New York. @NYGovCuomo now talking about what business should be the first to reopen as we “un-Pause” New York. @news4buffalo pic.twitter.com/zv6zKo0MP1 — Mel Orlins (@Mel_Orlins) April 16, 2020 On Wednesday morning, Cuomo announced he was issuing an executive order that New Yorkers must wear coverings on their nose and mouth while near others in public. People must wear these coverings if they cannot be six feet or more from someone. This includes anywhere indoors or outdoors, places of public transportation, private carriers and for-hire vehicles. This goes into effect on Friday at 8 p.m. Schools and non-essential businesses are closed through May 15 due to Cuomo’s New York State on PAUSE order, which was extended again on Thursday.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Click for more details. NY schools will remain closed through the rest of the academic year Coronavirus by: Evan Anstey, Chris Horvatits Posted: May 1, 2020 / 11:23 AM EDT / Updated: May 1, 2020 / 06:15 PM EDT ALBANY, N.Y. (WIVB) — Schools in New York will remain closed for the remainder of the school year. This includes both K-12 and colleges. Across New York, schools were shut down in mid-March in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Students have not reported to school in Erie County since March 13th. Since then, many educators have turned to digital teaching methods. These methods will continue. In terms of summer school, the future is uncertain. Gov. Cuomo says a decision will be made by the end of May. But Niagara Falls school superintendent Mark Laurrie said he doesn’t believe in-person summer school will be realistic. “I don’t know why we would risk it for summer school,” Laurrie said. Gov. Cuomo has asked schools to come up with plans to re-open, which would later be approved by the state. That being said, no decision has been made on whether or not schools will reopen for sure this fall. Laurrie says Niagara Falls school officials will look to expand their COVID committee as they develop their plan. “I appreciate the fact that we now have three or four months to really hone this in with multiple solutions for September, which is going to be completely different than anything we’ve seen before,” said Laurrie, noting a return to school this fall isn’t even a sure thing. “If they come back in September, it won’t be the way they came back in September of 2019, where everybody gets off the buss on day one and 24 kids go to a classroom.” Laurrie added. In Buffalo, Dr. Kriner Cash, the superintendent of Buffalo Public Schools, said they have already been working on a plan to re-open. Now that Cuomo has shut down school for the rest of the academic year, Cash says those discussions can “pick up in earnest” now. “We foresee some sort of remote learning continuing from now on,” Cash said. “We’ll never go back to just a brick and mortar delivery model of our program. We call it ‘from brick to click.'” Cash says his schools can’t open until they have PPE, and proper testing and tracing in place. To that end, the superintendent revealed he has been in touch with Erie County about a plan to set up antibody testing at up to 10 schools, possibly beginning later this month. However, finances could be an issue as the district looks to implement social distancing and safety policies. “We’re going to have to take something away from the left side of the equation to put more into the right side of the equation for any of this to work,” Cash said. “It’s not very realistic that we’ll have enough resources to significantly reduce class size.” The status of businesses is a different story, as New York State on PAUSE remains in effect through May 15. The Governor says a decision on changes to these regulations will be announced prior to that date. Between Thursday and Friday morning, 289 more people died as a result of COVID-19. 22 of them were in nursing homes. About 10,900 people are hospitalized because of it. Altogether, hospitals are seeing between 900 and 1,100 new cases of the virus each day, on average. Cuomo says that number is still too high. On a more positive note though, the Governor says the actions of New Yorkers have helped mitigate the spread. According to him, social distancing and other protective measures stopped roughly 100,000 people from being hospitalized. Now, one of the major operations of the state is tracing the virus. “The faster you trace, the better,” Cuomo said. But it’s not an easy task. Cuomo says the big challenge is the scale of the operation. On Wednesday alone, 4,681 New Yorkers tested positive for COVID-19. That’s out of roughly 30,000 people being tested in the state every day. Of the people who test positive, Cuomo says the state wants to know who they came into contact with. That includes finding out information about where the infected people live, where they work, and how they get from place to place. Other biological factors like sex, age and health conditions also come in to play in helping New York trace the virus. Last week, the Governor announced that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins University are leading tracing efforts in the state. So, with thousands of people testing positive for the virus on a daily basis, how will New York trace all of them? Gov. Cuomo says a “tracing army” must be assembled. The state is working to recruit Department of Health employees from across the state. Additionally, Cuomo says they are looking to bring in other government employees as tracers if they are available. Gov. Cuomo says nearly half of Americans say their mental health has been impacted. Three out of four say the pandemic has affected their sleep. If you wish to utilize the state’s emotional support hotline at this time, call 1-844-863-9314. Additional mental health resources can be found here. The Governor announced on Friday that the state is partnering with the Kate Spade New York Foundation and Crisis Text Line to provide frontline health care workers with 24/7 emotional support. Workers can text NYFRONTLINE to 741-741 to access this. Frontline workers are also eligible for mental health services without co-pay.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

(WIVB) — It’s official. Reopening has begun for some parts of New York, including Genesee, Wyoming and Orleans counties. Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an official modification that lists the changes on Thursday. Effective in eligible regions Friday at 12:01 a.m., Cuomo says the reductions and restrictions on the in-person workforce at non-essential businesses or other organizations no longer applies to “Phase One industries.” These Phase One industries include construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, manufacturing and wholesale trade. Retail is also included, but it’s limited to curbside or in-store pickup or drop off. Businesses must meet the prescribed public health and safety metrics determined by the New York State Department of Health, Cuomo says. The regions eligible to begin reopening are the Finger Lakes, North Country, Central New York, Southern Tier and Mohawk Valley. As of Friday, western New York has not yet met the criteria for reopening. Cuomo says that any regions that later meet the criteria for reopening will be permitted to do so. For now though, New York on PAUSE is in effect for ineligible regions through May 28. Cuomo has the power to modify disaster emergency-related laws through June 13. Some beaches in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Delaware will be open during Memorial Day Weekend, but with restrictions. MORE | The Governor’s latest update, with specifics, can be read here.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Cuomo announces programs to expand testing at pharmacies, help small businesses Coronavirus by: Evan Anstey Posted: May 22, 2020 / 10:53 AM EDT / Updated: May 22, 2020 / 02:53 PM EDT NEW YORK, N.Y. (WIVB) — Testing remains one of the biggest priorities of the state as parts of New York begin to reopen. During Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s daily briefing on Friday, he announced that the state is starting a new pilot program to expand testing at pharmacies. 52 independent pharmacies will be taking part in the program, to increase the amount of COVID-19 tests per week by 7,000. It’s not clear if any of these pharmacies are in western New York. This brings the amount of testing sites in New York to 750. Later in the day, Erie County Health Commissioner Dr. Gale Burstein urged people to get tested. She says the county has purchased 100,000 tests. MORE | Find a testing site here On Thursday, there were 109 more coronavirus-related deaths. 27 of the people who died were nursing home residents. During the Friday conference, Cuomo made another announcement regarding small businesses. Starting Tuesday, businesses with 20 or fewer full-time employees can pre-apply for the New York Forward Loan Fund. This program is aimed at helping small businesses as they reopen. Non-profits and landlords that have seen a drop in rental income also qualify for this program. Here are the other qualifications: Small businesses must have gross revenues of less than $3 million per year Nonprofits must provide direct services and have an annual operating budget of less than $3 million per year; and Have not received a loan from either SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) or SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) for COVID-19 in 2020. The geographic proportionality goal for this money’s use in western New York is 8 percent. The New York City region has the largest share of the funding goal, with 30 percent.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Cuomo issues executive order on police reform News by: WSYR, WIVB Posted: Jun 12, 2020 / 12:12 PM EDT / Updated: Jun 12, 2020 / 03:59 PM EDT NEW YORK CITY, N.Y. (WSYR-TV/WIVB) — New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced during his daily briefing on Friday that he would sign an executive order on police reform. Cuomo announced that he was launching the New York State Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative. The “Say Their Name” Reform Agenda Package was signed Friday by Cuomo. It includes: Allowing for transparency of prior disciplinary records of law enforcement officers by repealing 50-a of the civil rights law; Banning chokeholds by law enforcement officers; Prohibiting false race-based 911 reports; and Designating the Attorney General as an independent prosecutor for matters relating to the civilian deaths. Cuomo also said he would issue an executive order that would require local government and police agencies to develop a plan that reinvents and modernizes police strategies and programs. Cuomo said they must formulate a plan addressing the use of force by police officers, crowd management, community policing, implicit bias awareness training, de-escalation training and practices, restorative justice practices, community-based outreach, and have a transparent citizen complain disposition procedure to handle those and other issues raised by the community. Cuomo said there must be community participation, and this plan must be enacted into local law by April 1, 2021, or local police agencies can lose state funding. “We’re not going to fund police agencies in this state that can’t look at what is happening, come to terms with it, and reform themselves,” Cuomo said. Cuomo said the goal is to restore trust. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

Audio clip spurs social media debate over Yanny or Laurel News by: The Associated Press Posted: May 16, 2018 / 01:20 PM EDT / Updated: May 16, 2018 / 02:22 PM EDT Do you hear what I hear? That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

People without masks in public will first be issued a verbal warning, while a city worker will provide them with a free mask, the city said on its website. The next offense carries a $50 fine, while a third offense costs $150. A fourth offense will carry a fine of $500 — and a promise to appear in court, according to the Miami Herald, which noted that the city won't send unpaid fines to collection agencies.

Audio clip spurs social media debate over Yanny or Laurel News by: The Associated Press Posted: May 16, 2018 / 01:20 PM EDT / Updated: May 16, 2018 / 02:22 PM EDT Do you hear what I hear? That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Audio clip spurs social media debate over Yanny or Laurel News by: The Associated Press Posted: May 16, 2018 / 01:20 PM EDT / Updated: May 16, 2018 / 02:22 PM EDT Do you hear what I hear? That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

Cross border advocates join forces to fight NEXUS suspension in NY News Posted: Feb 24, 2020 / 06:15 PM EST / Updated: Feb 24, 2020 / 07:29 PM EST NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO (WIVB) Nineteen days after the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it will suspend New York residents’ ability to enroll or re-enroll in the Trusted Traveler Program, advocates for cross border commerce are joining forces to call for a reversal of the decision. The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

Audio clip spurs social media debate over Yanny or Laurel News by: The Associated Press Posted: May 16, 2018 / 01:20 PM EDT / Updated: May 16, 2018 / 02:22 PM EDT Do you hear what I hear? That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

One plan keeps students in school five days a week and encourages distancing. If the state suggests they go with a Hybrid plan, half of the students would come Monday, Thursday. The other half would come Tuesday Friday. ""It's not ideal,"" said Brian Bowling, a father of two students in the district.""My wife and I both work from home but with understanding employers that allow for some flexibility and understanding, the situation we should be able to manage but it'll be difficult, for the kids too.""

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Share this story More News Stories Pro-Russia vaccine misinfo finds home in US Facebook groups by AMANDA SEITZ, Associated Press / Aug 7, 2020 CHICAGO (AP) — A false report claiming five Ukrainians had died after taking an American-made coronavirus vaccine spread in just a matter of days from a small Kremlin-friendly website to an audience of thousands in U.S.-based Facebook groups. Russian media outlets picked up the claim, and soon social media users in the U.S. were sharing screenshots and links to those articles — all as 30,000 Americans were preparing to roll up their sleeves for shots of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine late last month. Read the Full Article US hiring slows in July as signs of lasting damage emerge Aug 7, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. hiring slowed in July as the coronavirus outbreak worsened, and the government’s jobs report offered signs Friday that the economic damage from the pandemic could last far longer than many observers originally envisioned. The United States added 1.8 million jobs in July, a pullback from the previous two months. At any other time, hiring at that level would be seen as a blowout gain. But after employers shed a staggering 22 million jobs in March and April, much larger increases are needed to heal the job market. The hiring of the past three months has recovered 42% of the jobs lost to the pandemic-induced recession, according to the Labor Department’s report.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

Russian media outlets picked up the claim, and soon social media users in the U.S. were sharing screenshots and links to those articles — all as 30,000 Americans were preparing to roll up their sleeves for shots of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine late last month. Read the Full Article US hiring slows in July as signs of lasting damage emerge Aug 7, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. hiring slowed in July as the coronavirus outbreak worsened, and the government’s jobs report offered signs Friday that the economic damage from the pandemic could last far longer than many observers originally envisioned. The United States added 1.8 million jobs in July, a pullback from the previous two months. At any other time, hiring at that level would be seen as a blowout gain. But after employers shed a staggering 22 million jobs in March and April, much larger increases are needed to heal the job market. The hiring of the past three months has recovered 42% of the jobs lost to the pandemic-induced recession, according to the Labor Department’s report.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

The decision outlined Thursday affects iOS 14, which is expected to be released as a free software upgrade to roughly a billion iPhone users later this month. Apple intended iOS 14 to automatically block tracking as soon as it came out, but the company now says it will hold back the tool until early next year.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Przewalski's horses are thought to be distant cousins of the domestic horse and once ran free in Europe and Asia before changes in the environment and competition with man and livestock led to their decline, according to the National Zoo. The wild horses have a distinct zebra-like mane that stands erect, along with stripes below their knees and a dark, plumed tail.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

Przewalski's horses are thought to be distant cousins of the domestic horse and once ran free in Europe and Asia before changes in the environment and competition with man and livestock led to their decline, according to the National Zoo. The wild horses have a distinct zebra-like mane that stands erect, along with stripes below their knees and a dark, plumed tail.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

(NEWS10) -- There are a lot of questions surrounding the way in which the State University of New York system is tracking COVID-19 cases -- whether they're using a 14-day static period or a rolling average. New York State has ordered all colleges -- not just SUNY schools -- to shift to remote learning if they reach 100 cases in a 14-day period. But that does not necessarily mean 100 cases total; just within the two-week period. Therefore, a school could presumably have more than 100 cases but not be forced to close.

The death of the nation's second female Supreme Court jurist instantly set off speculation about the balance of the court and the Senate's ability to confirm a justice prior to the instillation of a new president.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

All of them were marked for President Donald Trump, it said. Then came another news release with key details changed but still little explanation of what had happened and whether investigators believed a criminal act had occurred.

(AP) — A Louisiana state trooper who died in a single-car crash just hours after he was told he would be fired for his role in the death of a Black man was buried with honors Friday at a ceremony that authorities sought to keep secret out of concerns it would attract a mass protest. State Police officials and family members mourned Master Trooper Chris Hollingsworth under tight security at services that marked the latest turn in the long-simmering in-custody death case of Ronald Greene, which has prompted a federal civil-rights probeand increasing calls for authorities to release body-camera video.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

(NEWS10) — The UAlbany Dean of the School of Public Health, Dr. David Holtgrave, says there are still promising therapeutics being investigated to treat COVID-19 patients. This comes as the World Health Organization released a new study on the anti-viral drug Remdesivir. The study finds that the drug has little or no effect on mortality for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The study found Remdesivir doesn't help patients recover any faster, either. Results from the study were not published in a peer-reviewed journal, but instead to a ""pre-print server.” Read the Full Article Video How popular is your Halloween costume this year?

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The overall death toll has reached about 253,000, by far the highest in the world. Total confirmed infections have eclipsed more than 11.7 million, after the biggest one-day gain on record Thursday — almost 188,000. And the number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 hit another all-time high at more than 80,000.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

Share this story More News Stories Trump golfs in Florida as COVID relief hangs in the balance by JILL COLVIN, Associated Press / Dec 25, 2020 PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump spent his Christmas golfing in Florida as a government shutdown looms and COVID relief hangs in the balance. Trump, at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach for the holidays, had no events on his public schedule after throwing the future of a massive COVID relief and government funding bill into question.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

It also resurfaces a question with no certain answer: What would happen if a military commander determined, based on legal judgment, that a president's nuclear launch order was illegal?

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

Elections would pose a major risk for Abbas' Fatah party and also for Hamas, which welcomed the decree. Both have faced protests in recent years over their inability to reconcile with one another, advance Palestinian aspirations for statehood or meet the basic needs of those in the territories they govern.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

Share this story More News Stories Dominant D carried Bills to a third AFC title by Jerry Sullivan / Jan 22, 2021 It’s funny, the things you remember. Phil Hansen’s most vivid memory of the 1993 AFC championship game is of Chuck Lester, the Bills’ assistant linebackers coach, pulling him aside before the game and saying ‘You’re going to make a big play for us today.’ Hansen, who had emerged as a play-making left defensive end in his second NFL season, didn’t think much of it at the time. Lester was renowned for firing up players before games. He felt that planting a seed of belief could help a player be ready when his big opportunity presented itself.

And yet, 2021 is starting on a similar path that led to the decision last March to postpone the games for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Read the Full Article Kansas advances anti-abortion measure on Roe anniversary by JOHN HANNA, Associated Press / Jan 22, 2021 TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Republicans on Friday pushed a proposed anti-abortion amendment to the Kansas Constitution through the state House, a bitter reminder of election setbacks for abortion rights Democrats on the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide. The vote was 86-38 on a measure that would overturn a 2019 Kansas Supreme Court decision that declared access to abortion a “fundamental” right under the state's Bill of Rights. Abortion opponents had two votes more than the two-thirds majority necessary for passage, sending the proposal to the Senate, where a debate could occur as early as next week.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

Meghan, 39, and Queen Elizabeth's grandson Harry, 36, surprised the royal family in January last year by announcing they would step down from their official royal roles to forge a new, independent life in California.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The $1.9 trillion legislation signed by President Joe Biden on Thursday includes among its dozens of provisions the biggest expansion of health insurance tax credits under the Affordable Care Act in a decade. It cements the place of the Obama-era law among government health insurance programs, after four years of fruitless efforts by former President Donald Trump to overturn it.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile.

Three people with direct knowledge of NCAA testing protocols said full-scale testing has not resumed since the coronavirus pandemic shut down college sports a year ago. Although athletes may have been tested on campus, either through the NCAA program or those run by schools, the NCAA has not ramped up its usual testing program at national championships such as the men's and women's basketball tournaments. The tournaments wrap up with Final Four games starting with the women's semifinals Friday.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

Share this story More News Stories US panel urges restarting vaccinations with Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 shot by Stephen M. Lepore / Apr 23, 2021 WASHINGTON — A CDC panel has urged restarting vaccinations with Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 shot Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said on April 13 they were investigating unusual clots that occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. The clots occurred in veins that drain blood from the brain and occurred together with low platelets. All six cases were in women between the ages of 18 and 48; there was one death and all remained under investigation. Read the Full Article America’s gas-fueled vehicles imperil Biden’s climate goals by TOM KRISHER, Associated Press / Apr 23, 2021 DETROIT (AP) — For President Joe Biden to reach his ambitious goal of slashing America’s greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, huge reductions would have to come from someplace other than one of the worst culprits: Auto tailpipes. That’s because there are just too many gas-powered passenger vehicles in the United States — roughly 279 million — to replace them in less than a decade, experts say. In a normal year, automakers sell about 17 million vehicles nationwide. Even if every one of the new ones were electric, it would take more than 16 years to replace the whole fleet.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Categories: News, Top Stories Loading ...

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce on the Canadian side are joining the Buffalo Niagara Partnership in firing off a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security urging him to reverse a decision that suspended any New York residents from applying or renewing their membership in the Trusted Traveler program. “It’s the message that this decision is going to be bad for business. It’s gonna impact jobs,” said Hugo Chesshire, of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. Chesshire says 40% of trucks on the local bridges use the Fast program and if the New York based trucks are phased out of that over five years, it will affect all travelers and affect commerce. “There’s a lot of businesses that depend on both, like auto parts is a big export,” said Chesshire. “There are plants in Canada, there are parts plants in the States and they rely on being able to ship components to one another to make a finished automobile. With stuff like this being in the way, you could end up with plants being idled with production not happening, possibly workers being laid off. It remains to be seen exactly what the consequences are, but that’s another issue that we have is that the consequences of shutting this down haven’t really been explored or explained, so the truth is, we can’t really say what the economic impact is.” From day one, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership president, Dottie Gallagher has been outspoken against the decision. “It just feels like a lot of tit-for-tat and a lot of Washington and New York State sort of duking it out and we are gonna pay the price for that, not only crossing the bridge but even global entry, so it’s just ridiculous.” Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc.

That’s the question as a short audio clip has sparked a social media debate about whether the word is “yanny” or “laurel.” How one hears it is similar to how people viewed a dress on the internet three years ago. The debate began on Reddit and expanded throughout social media. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted everything at her show stopped to see what people heard. She said she heard Laurel. But New Age musician Yanni was in the Yanny camp. Some people speculated the age of the listener might determine what people heard, while others changed the pitch to alter results. As for the dress, some people said it was white and gold while others saw blue and black. Copyright 2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
