Police say these fraudsters tend to fabricate an urgent, health-related scenario when contacting their victim — similar to most other cyber scams — in an effort to pressure that person into providing them with funds or information as quickly as possible. The CAFC has compiled a list of the most common types of scams that have been circulating, many of which involve fraudsters pretending to be from reputable companies or organizations. These include: • Fraudulent calls from companies offering duct cleaning services or air filters to protect from COVID-19 • Hydro companies threatening to cut off power for nonpayment • Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization selling lists of nearby residents who have contracted the virus • Public Health Agency of Canada providing test results in return for personal information • Charities offering personal protective equipment in exchange for a donation • Companies selling rapid COVID-19 tests and more These scams take many forms including phone calls, text messages and emails. The CAFC is reminding residents that fraudsters can also spoof their phone numbers and emails to make them appear as though coming from genuine organizations. Has this happened to you? If you think you have been scammed, there are some steps you can take. If the interaction happened on a computer, running anti-virus software or speaking to a trusted computer technician may help get rid of any viruses or malware, the OPP said. The centre also recommends changing your passwords, as the scammer may have accessed them during the interaction. If you have provided any financial information to the fraudster, the OPP recommends contacting your banking institution immediately.
