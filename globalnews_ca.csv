The e-commerce platform developer, headquartered in Ottawa with more than 5,000 employees in Toronto, Waterloo, Montreal, Vancouver and around the world, will keep its offices closed until the end of 2021 to prepare for the company‚Äôs permanent work-for-home reality, CEO Tobi Lutke tweeted Thursday morning. When those offices do reopen, most employees will continue to work from home. ‚ÄúShopify is a digital by default company,‚Äù Lutke tweeted. ‚ÄúOffice centricity is over.‚Äù 5:01 Coronavirus and the workplace Coronavirus and the workplace Shopify, which surpassed more than 1,000 employees in its hometown of Ottawa last year and briefly overtook RBC as Canada‚Äôs most valuable company on the Toronto Stock Exchange a few weeks ago, was an early adopter of remote working amid the coronavirus pandemic. Story continues below advertisement The company asked its entire staff to work from home starting March 11, with Lutke noting then that a large portion of the company‚Äôs workforce already worked remotely. Lutke said in his tweets Thursday that every Shopify employee will now have the same experience no matter where they work. READ MORE: Working from home because of coronavirus? Here‚Äôs how to stay productive He noted it will also help the company connect to the merchants it serves, as many direct-to-consumer businesses that use the Shopify platform to power their online stores also work from home. Lutke said Shopify hasn‚Äôt figured out all the details yet around operating a remote-first business but that the company has always been good at change. COVID is challenging us all to work together in new ways. We choose to jump in the driver‚Äôs seat, instead of being passengers to the changes ahead. We cannot go back to the way things were. This isn‚Äôt a choice; this is the future ‚Äî Tobi Lutke üå≥üå≤üõíüïπ (@tobi) May 21, 2020 Story continues below advertisement Shawn Hamilton, a senior vice-president with real estate services firm CBRE in Ottawa, tells Global News that the local e-commerce giant has long been a trendsetter in the city‚Äôs office market, and if anyone can make a leap like this work, it‚Äôs Shopify. Trending Stories Nurse struggling with COVID-19 trauma found dead in his car Dollar fight? Loon killed bald eagle with ‚Äòshot through the heart‚Äô ‚ÄúIf it were any other company I would take it as a venting of frustration. But these guys have always been the thin edge of the wedge in leading the way,‚Äù Hamilton says. The technology to enable a fully remote operation is already in place, Hamilton says, but what will make or break Shopify‚Äôs remote experiment is the sociological dimensions of working in an office and meeting others face to face. In other words, the coronavirus pandemic has proven tech companies can work from home ‚Äî now they have to decide if they really want to. Lutke‚Äôs decision to have employees permanently work remotely comes after Shopify started beefing up its real estate with a new office in Toronto at the King Portland Centre, steps away from the company‚Äôs first office in Canada‚Äôs largest city. It also announced that it would lease about 23,597 square metres (253,995 square feet) of space at The Well complex in Toronto to be built at Front Street West and Spadina Avenue. In January, the company said it would open its first permanent office in downtown Vancouver at the Four Bentall Centre by late 2020. Story continues below advertisement READ MORE: Burnout is real ‚Äî even when working from home And back in Ottawa, Shopify operates from its 150 Elgin St. headquarters with another office around the corner at 234 Laurier Ave. But what will happen to these offices if Shopify no longer needs to fill them with employees? In a statement to Global News, a Shopify spokesperson said the company will be ‚Äúre-designing‚Äù its existing offices and is ‚Äúcommitted to retaining recruitment hubs‚Äù in its major Canadian markets. Should Shopify opt to downsize any of its offices in downtown Ottawa, Hamilton believes there will be sufficient demand to snap up any vacant space. New private-sector players with a ‚Äúdifferent philosophy‚Äù on office space might take over a few floors from the e-commerce firm, or the federal government, which was already growing in size before the pandemic hit, could swoop in to boost its own downtown portfolio, he suggests. While Shopify has been a trendsetter for years to other urban tech companies in Ottawa, Hamilton suggests other startups tread carefully before tearing up their leases. ‚ÄúI would caution companies to make changes, not borne out of frustration, but because it is a strategic, measured complement to their business,‚Äù he says. Shopify‚Äôs latest news comes just a day after it unveiled a slew of new products to support merchants through the COVID-19 pandemic during its online Reunite conference. Story continues below advertisement The company‚Äôs stock now regularly reaches more than $1,000 in trading, and the company says more than one million businesses now use its offerings. ‚Äî With files from Canadian Press 3:05 Shopify continues to grow amid Toronto‚Äôs evolving tech scene Shopify continues to grow amid Toronto‚Äôs evolving tech scene ¬© 2020 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Rod Phillips said the pandemic has created an ‚Äúunprecedented health crisis‚Äù and the province had to spend billions to support the health-care sector and help businesses and residents weather the storm. In March, the Progressive Conservative government said the deficit would reach $20.5 billion by the end of 2020-2021, but Phillips said Wednesday that due to billions more in spending required by the ongoing pandemic, the number is set to reach $38.5 billion.

Prior to the pandemic, Ontario had been projecting a $9-billion deficit for 2020-2021 and Premier Doug Ford had pledged to balance the province‚Äôs books by 2023-2024 ‚Äî into a hypothetical second mandate for the Tories.

Read more: Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuy American‚Äô plan could impact Canadian business ‚Äî here‚Äôs how The aim of the policy is not a new one in U.S. politics: ensuring that American manufacturers, workers and suppliers are the primary beneficiaries of U.S. government largesse, including an estimated $600 billion a year in procurement contracts. The Trump administration liked to talk about Buy American, Biden said, but ultimately did little to toughen or even enforce the rules. Story continues below advertisement ‚ÄúThat is going to change on our watch,‚Äù he said, signing an executive order to raise standards for U.S. content, increase oversight and provide for more stringent enforcement. 0:43 Coronavirus: President Biden to sign ‚ÄòBuy American‚Äô executive order Coronavirus: President Biden to sign ‚ÄòBuy American‚Äô executive order The measures include a ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù office attached to the White House to police the use of waivers ‚Äî the exceptions that allow Canadian contractors, manufacturers and suppliers access to a lucrative and often essential source of business. That office will ‚Äúreview waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances ‚Äî for example, when there‚Äôs an overwhelming national security, humanitarian or emergency need here in America,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúThis hasn‚Äôt happened before. It will happen now.‚Äù Waiver details will also be posted on a U.S. government website to provide more public transparency about who is getting around the rules and why. Story continues below advertisement Read more: Biden says U.S. government contracts must ‚Äòbuy American‚Äô to be approved The plan would also increase the amount of U.S.-produced materials or components a project or product would need to qualify as American-made, and make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to access procurement opportunities. It also requires government agencies to provide twice-yearly progress reports on their efforts to follow the new rules. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúAmerican manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War Two, and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now.‚Äù In a statement Monday, Canada‚Äôs Trade Minister Mary Ng said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his call with Biden Friday emphasized that workers in both countries ‚Äúbenefit from our integrated, secure and resilient supply chains.‚Äù 2:33 Biden‚Äôs first call to foreign leader is with Trudeau Biden‚Äôs first call to foreign leader is with Trudeau ‚ÄúThe Prime Minister and President agreed to consult closely, and discussions between our two countries are already underway,‚Äù the statement read.

Read more: Trudeau expresses ‚Äòdisappointment‚Äô over Keystone XL in 1st phone call with Biden Story continues below advertisement The enforcement of procurement rules can sometimes be haphazard, particularly when they are confusing and poorly understood, said Ujczo, senior counsel with the U.S. firm Thompson Hine LLP. ‚ÄúCanada has a network of agreements with the U.S. to address Buy American programs, but the nuance often is lost on procurement officers that do not want to risk using non-U.S. products,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf Canadian companies can use this new Made in America office at OMB to emphasize Canada‚Äôs ‚Äòexemptionalism,‚Äô it could prove worthwhile.‚Äù Dennis Darby, the CEO of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, said the job now is to remind Biden that the U.S. and Canada ‚Äúbuild things together,‚Äù and that the rules risk sideswiping Canada in the same way they did 10 years ago. ‚ÄúAnyone who thought it was suddenly going to be easy, clear sailing now that Mr. Trump is gone, I think, was probably not thinking realistically,‚Äù Darby said. 1:47 Coronavirus: U.S. is at ‚Äòa precarious moment for the virus and the economy,‚Äô says economic advisor Coronavirus: U.S. is at ‚Äòa precarious moment for the virus and the economy,‚Äô says economic advisor ‚Äì Jan 22, 2021 It may help that Biden was vice-president in 2010, when Canada secured a waiver under the Buy American provisions imposed by then-president Barack Obama the previous year, Darby added.

The deal envisioned relying instead on the terms of the World Trade Organization‚Äôs general procurement agreement, to which both Canada and the U.S. are signatories. Biden said he ‚Äúremains committed to working with partners and allies to modernize international trade rules ‚Äî including those related to government procurement.‚Äù Even so, Canadian suppliers and contractors will need to remain on guard, Ujczo said. ‚ÄúMake no mistake: Canadian companies, supported by federal and provincial governments, will need to remain vigilant and aggressive on this file.

Premier Doug Ford made the announcement alongside Ontario Minister of Health Christine Elliott and Chief medical Officer of Health (CMOH) Dr. David Williams at his daily press conference at Queen‚Äôs Park. Read more: Toronto will remain in ‚Äòmodified Stage 2‚Äô until Nov. 14, while rest of Ontario to move into new system In a document entitled, ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Response Framework: Keeping Ontario Safe and Open,‚Äù the government outlines its priorities and principles for the province as it deals with the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen numbers in the 700s and higher for the past several weeks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre giving you a clear understanding of where you are as a region,‚Äù Ford said. ‚ÄúI know that you want access to more data. I know you want predictability.‚Äù Story continues below advertisement According to the documents, close contact is the highest risk of transmitting the virus, which highlights the need for people to continue to physically distance, stay home when ill, wash hands frequently, and wear a mask. Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa have seen the highest case counts during the second wave and were therefore placed in a ‚Äúmodified Stage 2‚Äù shutdown for 28 days, which ends Nov. 7. York Region followed shortly after. The new framework aims to adjust and/or tighten measures as ‚Äútrends in public health indicators improve.‚Äù Read more: Ontario promises new care standard in long-term care, to be implemented by 2024-2025 The following levels were used: Prevent (standard measures ‚Äî green), protect (strengthened measures ‚Äî yellow), restrict (intermediate measures ‚Äî orange), control (stringent measures ‚Äî red), and lockdown (maximum measures ‚Äî grey). The goal is to have all public health unit regions in the ‚Äúprevent‚Äù level. The system goes into effect 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Most regions are to be in the Prevent level, with the exception of Brant County, Hamilton, Durham and Halton, which are in Protect level and Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Peel, Toronto and York which are in the Restrict level. Ford said those regions in the ‚Äúmodified Stage 2‚Äù, except Toronto, will move to the Restrict level at 12:01 a.m. Nov. 7. Ford said Toronto Mayor John Tory asked for one more week to Nov. 14, until the city follows suit, to which the premier agreed.

Regions move from different levels depending on positivity rates and case numbers, among other things. Under the new system, a region that moves up into a category with tighter restrictions will stay there for 28 days. ‚ÄúIndicators will generally be assessed based on the previous two weeks of information,‚Äù the document said. ‚ÄúHowever, movement to apply measures will be considered sooner than two weeks if there is a rapidly worsening trend.‚Äù View image in full screen Where public health units fall in the new levels proposed by government.

Premier Doug Ford made the announcement alongside Ontario Minister of Health Christine Elliott and Chief medical Officer of Health (CMOH) Dr. David Williams at his daily press conference at Queen‚Äôs Park.

I know you want predictability.‚Äù Story continues below advertisement According to the documents, close contact is the highest risk of transmitting the virus, which highlights the need for people to continue to physically distance, stay home when ill, wash hands frequently, and wear a mask. Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa have seen the highest case counts during the second wave and were therefore placed in a ‚Äúmodified Stage 2‚Äù shutdown for 28 days, which ends Nov. 7. York Region followed shortly after. The new framework aims to adjust and/or tighten measures as ‚Äútrends in public health indicators improve.‚Äù Read more: Ontario promises new care standard in long-term care, to be implemented by 2024-2025 The following levels were used: Prevent (standard measures ‚Äî green), protect (strengthened measures ‚Äî yellow), restrict (intermediate measures ‚Äî orange), control (stringent measures ‚Äî red), and lockdown (maximum measures ‚Äî grey). The goal is to have all public health unit regions in the ‚Äúprevent‚Äù level. The system goes into effect 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Most regions are to be in the Prevent level, with the exception of Brant County, Hamilton, Durham and Halton, which are in Protect level and Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Peel, Toronto and York which are in the Restrict level. Ford said those regions in the ‚Äúmodified Stage 2‚Äù, except Toronto, will move to the Restrict level at 12:01 a.m. Nov. 7. Ford said Toronto Mayor John Tory asked for one more week to Nov. 14, until the city follows suit, to which the premier agreed.

Regions move from different levels depending on positivity rates and case numbers, among other things. Under the new system, a region that moves up into a category with tighter restrictions will stay there for 28 days. ‚ÄúIndicators will generally be assessed based on the previous two weeks of information,‚Äù the document said. ‚ÄúHowever, movement to apply measures will be considered sooner than two weeks if there is a rapidly worsening trend.‚Äù View image in full screen Where public health units fall in the new levels proposed by government.

The Ipsos poll conducted exclusively for Global News found Singh was the only party leader who was viewed more positively than negatively, with 45 per cent approval versus 39 per cent disapproval among those surveyed. Trudeau, by contrast, had the highest unfavourability rating of any leader at 53 per cent, while 41 per cent said they viewed him favourably. ‚Äú(Singh) represents the most serious challenge to Justin Trudeau and his leadership,‚Äù said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. ‚ÄúThose (progressive) voters, which is the largest group of voters that we have in the Canadian electorate, they‚Äôre now dividing their loyalties between the two of them. And that‚Äôs not a situation Justin Trudeau has faced since 2015.‚Äù Story continues below advertisement Read more: Liberals, Conservatives in dead heat as Trudeau‚Äôs popularity dips: election poll 2:12 Canada election: Polls suggest election race is tightening Canada election: Polls suggest election race is tightening The poll, which surveyed 1,500 Canadians online last weekend, suggests Conservative Leader Erin O‚ÄôToole and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul are struggling to connect with voters ‚Äî even within their own parties. Only 28 per cent of respondents said they viewed O‚ÄôToole favourably while 48 per cent viewed him unfavourably, though 24 per cent said they don‚Äôt know the new party leader well enough to have an opinion. Yet only 69 per cent of likely Conservative voters were favourable about O‚ÄôToole, compared to 93 per cent of Liberal voters saying the same about Trudeau and 92 per cent of NDP voters supporting Singh. Story continues below advertisement ‚ÄúOne of the things that‚Äôs really uncommon in an election campaign is to see a political leader who‚Äôs offside with his party,‚Äù Bricker said. ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs in a difficult position with both his party and with the Canadian electorate. ‚ÄúBut the dissatisfaction level with the prime minister at the moment is making the possibility of Erin O‚ÄôToole improving those numbers very realistic.‚Äù 1:52 Canada election: Are Conservatives trying to secure a broader base? Canada election: Are Conservatives trying to secure a broader base? ‚Äì Aug 25, 2021 The poll results show Paul is in an even worse position. Although she had the highest number of respondents say they didn‚Äôt know her well enough, at 42 per cent, just 15 per cent said they viewed her favourably versus 43 per cent unfavourably. And only 54 per cent of Green voters had a positive opinion, with 22 per cent negative and 24 per cent unsure. Bricker says Paul, who is still trying to get a seat in the House of Commons, is struggling to replicate the appeal and awareness that former leader Elizabeth May had. That, coupled with recent infighting within the party, has put more pressure on her than most of the other leaders to perform well at the upcoming debates. Trending Stories There are plenty of jobs out there. Why aren‚Äôt Canadians filling them? O‚ÄôToole pledges to keep assault rifle ban. His platform says it‚Äôll be gone. Here‚Äôs what we know Story continues below advertisement ‚ÄúIf she does a good job, you‚Äôll probably see some of these numbers start to turn around,‚Äù Bricker said. ‚ÄúBut right now, she‚Äôs not the asset to the party that Elizabeth May was, it‚Äôs very clear.‚Äù Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet was the only leader to see equal numbers viewing him both favourably and unfavourably, at 39 per cent of those surveyed in Quebec, while 89 per cent of likely Bloc voters saw him in a positive light. Maxime Bernier, who leads the People‚Äôs Party of Canada, had the widest gulf between favourability and unfavourability. Just 14 per cent viewed him positively versus 52 per cent negatively. 2:02 Canada election: Liberals try to get campaign on track Canada election: Liberals try to get campaign on track ‚Äì Aug 24, 2021 Trudeau in trouble Just a week ago, Trudeau was seen as the best choice for prime minister among those surveyed by Ipsos, even though a plurality of voters found him untrustworthy. Story continues below advertisement But new polling this week has shown the Liberals have lost their advantage over the Conservatives, with the two parties statistically tied in the popular vote. The NDP, meanwhile, is gaining ground and has the potential to win back at least some of the seats it lost in 2019. The most recent survey shows Singh is outperforming Trudeau among voters aged 18 to 34 ‚Äî 53 per cent of whom viewed the NDP leader favourably, versus 44 per cent for Trudeau ‚Äî and those aged 35 to 54 (42 per cent versus 37 per cent). Both demographics are key to the Liberals‚Äô success. Bricker says that, combined with the ground gained by the Conservatives in just a week of campaigning, spells trouble for Trudeau. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing at the moment is that the Liberal Party is struggling with fighting on two fronts, and it hasn‚Äôt had to really do that to the same extent as it did back in, say, 2011, as they are right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSomething has to be done (by the Liberals) not just to slow down Mr. O‚ÄôToole, but in particular for Justin Trudeau ‚Äî given the importance of his leadership to the Liberal Party ‚Äî something also has to be done to reduce the level of appeal for Mr. Singh. And what that is, is not obvious.‚Äù 2:18 Canada election: The concerns of undecided voters in B.C. Canada election: The concerns of undecided voters in B.C.

That will be particularly apparent during the French language debates, Bricker says. ‚ÄúO‚ÄôToole has made some commitments about what he‚Äôs going to do for the province of Quebec,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd nobody can challenge him like a hometown hero like Mr. Blanchet. So it‚Äôll be interesting to see how he deals with that.‚Äù As for Singh, Bricker says he now has plenty of momentum ‚Äî particularly given that early polling at the start of the election found the NDP was a clear second choice among many undecided voters. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a credible alternative right now to Justin Trudeau,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs absolutely an asset to the NDP ticket.‚Äù These are some of the findings of an Ipsos poll conducted between August 20 and 23, on behalf of Global News. For this survey, a sample of n = 1,500 Canadians aged 18+ was interviewed online, via the Ipsos I-Say panel and non-panel sources. Respondents earn a nominal incentive for their participation. Quotas and weighting were employed to balance demographics to ensure that the sample‚Äôs composition reflects that of the adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. The precision of Ipsos polls which include non-probability sampling is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll is accurate to within ¬± 2.9 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Canadians been polled. The credibility interval will be wider among subsets of the population. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error.
