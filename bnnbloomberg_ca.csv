Asked if they think it is a good idea to make a new 30-hour work week, also known as a four-day work week, standard in Canada, 53 per cent of respondents answered yes. That’s more than twice the number of both those who said it’s a bad idea (22 per cent) and those who said they are not sure or can’t say (25 per cent). This represents an increase in support of six percentage points compared to 2018, when in a separate study conducted by the institute, 47 per cent of respondents said they thought a four-day work week is a good idea. The increase in support may be driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges it has presented for many unemployed Canadians, according to the study. It found that Canadians who have applied for emergency government aid such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) are more likely to support the idea of shortening the work week. Almost three in five, or 58 per cent, of respondents who are government-aid applicants said a four-day work week is a good idea. That compares to 50 per cent of those who have not applied for aid programs. The idea of a shortened standard work week is not new. But, the study noted, it has recently gained traction after the announcement of a pilot project in a Nova Scotia municipality, and after New Zealand’s prime minister promoted the four-day work week as a way to boost domestic tourism. The survey was conducted online among 1,510 Canadian adults, between June 8 and June 10. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

More Video Canada Company News 7h ago 'More action rather than words': The long road ahead for ending systemic racism in business Hilary Punchard, BNN Bloomberg A man attends a demonstration calling for justice for the death of George Floyd and all victims of police brutality, in Montreal, Sunday, June 7, 2020. The Canadian Press/Graham Hughes While many institutions have issued statements of support amid the rise of anti-racism protests across the globe, some activists say there’s still a long road ahead in quashing systemic racism in Canadian business – and that it needs to start with meaningful action. Tomee Elizabeth Sojourner-Campbell, a Toronto-based consultant focusing on matters related to anti-Black racism and inclusion, said it isn’t enough for businesses to publish statements anymore. “We need more action rather than words,” Sojourner-Campbell told BNN Bloomberg in a phone interview. “[Companies need to] really look at how they are practicing, what they are saying they’d like to see in terms of the ending of anti-Black racism and supporting Black communities. They have to do the work in their own organizations.” One business leader says making fundamental shifts in the workplace starts at the top. “The fact of the matter is that this is everywhere and we have to look at all the areas in our society where anti-Black systemic racism exists, and really look at employment information in the C-Suite level,” Wes Hall, executive chairman and founder of Kingsdale Advisors, said in a phone interview. Earlier this month, Hall announced the creation of the BlackNorth Initiative, with the goal of increasing Black representation in boardrooms and executive suites across Canada. The foundation includes other powerhouses in Canadian business, such as CIBC CEO Victor Dodig, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. Chairman Prem Watsa and Cisco Systems Canada CEO Rola Dagher. As business leaders acknowledge the work that needs to be done within their companies, federal institutions are looking to make changes as well. Statistics Canada said it will start including information on race in its monthly employment reports starting in July after acknowledging the social, economic and labour impact of COVID-19 has not been equally felt by all Canadians. Meanwhile, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) said it recognizes there’s a lack of diversity in its ranks and said it will start reviewing all of its policies and practices through a racialized lens to eliminate discrimination at the federal housing agency. Many well-known brands are also starting to make changes to their business to become more inclusive. Johnson & Johnson Inc.’s Band-Aid recently said it will launch a range of products in “light, medium and deep shades of Brown and Black skin tones that embrace the beauty of diverse skin.” And Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian resigned from the company’s board of directors and urged for the company to replace him with a black candidate. “I believe resignation can actually be an act of leadership from people in power right now,” Ohanian wrote on Twitter. “To everyone fighting to fix our broken nation: do not stop.” Vancouver-based Aritzia Inc. also announced changes to address systemic racism and inequality from a corporate level. The retailer said in a statement earlier this month it would invest $1 million to expand their diversity and inclusion program. Real change starts from within. https://t.co/tsIy7hqW2a pic.twitter.com/TAz4LYL8Ef — aritzia (@ARITZIA) June 15, 2020 Canadian technology giant Shopify Inc. CEO, Tobi Lutke, meanwhile, has said that the company will donate a total of $1 million split between the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Black Health Alliance and Campaign Zero. But we need to act today. So Shopify will donate: 500k to @NAACP_LDF 250K to @BlackHealthCAN 250K to https://t.co/jcf9siQBB3 — Tobi Lutke 🌳🌲🛒🕹 (@tobi) June 1, 2020 But despite good intentions, some businesses have faced backlash over their efforts. For example, Calgary-based Righteous Gelato pulled its controversial Black Lives Matter frozen dessert less than a day after it was released. The specialty chocolate mint chip gelato featured a label depicting a Black Lives Matter protest, with face masks that read “I can’t breathe.” The company said it had launched the product with the intention of donating part of the sales, but it was widely panned on social media for being insensitive. It was only a matter of time before this egregious type of commodification of the struggle happened. I got to say though, if you’re going to be tone deaf and build a brand through controversy, go all the way. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/vXNNzRscVI — Eric Peters (@EricPetersAB) June 13, 2020 “If they had Black people helping with that in their senior suite, that wouldn’t have happened,” Hall said. “If consultants that they hired had Black people in senior positions, that wouldn’t have happened.” While some companies have taken steps to combat systemic racism, diversity and inclusion strategist Alden Habacon said they are still only at the start of cementing real change. “I feel like we're just at the beginning of the work. Most folks never get to the policy level,” said Habacon over email. When looking ahead, Hall said that companies need to identify barriers in their own businesses. In terms of how companies can actually address these barriers, Sojourner-Campbell said strategic policies will help. “The intuitional change will come through a sustained set of strategic policies, procedural changes if they need them and investing in an outlined process,” Sojourner-Campbell said. “Depending on the size of the organization, it may take a number of years and to phase in the necessary changes they have to make in order to live up to what they say they’re going to do.” Sojourner-Campbell added that businesses need to think of sustainability and continue the work needed to address systemic racism once protests come to an end. “I’m hoping that businesses are thinking about sustainability, because they’ve made their commitment publicly,” Sojourner-Campbell said. “They (companies) need to continue, they need to update the public with what they’re actually doing with substantive plans on what they’ve done, and what they intend to do – and keep that dialogue going after the protests to bring real change.” Related Mastercard promises to increase Black leadership by 50% by 2025 Microsoft to add US$150M on diversity, double black leaders Fed's first black president calls on policymakers to step up Pipeline & Politics 3:32 Michigan calls for closure of Enbridge Great Lakes pipeline 6:41 After years of angst, Canada's oil pipeline problem may be over Enbridge reopens underwater section of Line 5 pipeline after inspection Coastal GasLink set to lay first pipe as it ramps up construction 7:43 Much of the economic recovery is a mirage: John Zechner 2:11 Trans Mountain resumes operation after weekend spill Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2020 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Asked if they think it is a good idea to make a new 30-hour work week, also known as a four-day work week, standard in Canada, 53 per cent of respondents answered yes. That’s more than twice the number of both those who said it’s a bad idea (22 per cent) and those who said they are not sure or can’t say (25 per cent). This represents an increase in support of six percentage points compared to 2018, when in a separate study conducted by the institute, 47 per cent of respondents said they thought a four-day work week is a good idea. The increase in support may be driven in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges it has presented for many unemployed Canadians, according to the study. It found that Canadians who have applied for emergency government aid such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) are more likely to support the idea of shortening the work week. Almost three in five, or 58 per cent, of respondents who are government-aid applicants said a four-day work week is a good idea. That compares to 50 per cent of those who have not applied for aid programs. The idea of a shortened standard work week is not new. But, the study noted, it has recently gained traction after the announcement of a pilot project in a Nova Scotia municipality, and after New Zealand’s prime minister promoted the four-day work week as a way to boost domestic tourism. The survey was conducted online among 1,510 Canadian adults, between June 8 and June 10. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

More Video Canada Company News Jun 26, 2020 'More action rather than words': The long road ahead for ending systemic racism in business Hilary Punchard, BNN Bloomberg A man attends a demonstration calling for justice for the death of George Floyd and all victims of police brutality, in Montreal, Sunday, June 7, 2020. The Canadian Press/Graham Hughes While many institutions have issued statements of support amid the rise of anti-racism protests across the globe, some activists say there’s still a long road ahead in quashing systemic racism in Canadian business – and that it needs to start with meaningful action. Tomee Elizabeth Sojourner-Campbell, a Toronto-based consultant focusing on matters related to anti-Black racism and inclusion, said it isn’t enough for businesses to publish statements anymore. “We need more action rather than words,” Sojourner-Campbell told BNN Bloomberg in a phone interview. “[Companies need to] really look at how they are practicing, what they are saying they’d like to see in terms of the ending of anti-Black racism and supporting Black communities. They have to do the work in their own organizations.” One business leader says making fundamental shifts in the workplace starts at the top. “The fact of the matter is that this is everywhere and we have to look at all the areas in our society where anti-Black systemic racism exists, and really look at employment information in the C-Suite level,” Wes Hall, executive chairman and founder of Kingsdale Advisors, said in a phone interview. Earlier this month, Hall announced the creation of the BlackNorth Initiative, with the goal of increasing Black representation in boardrooms and executive suites across Canada. The foundation includes other powerhouses in Canadian business, such as CIBC CEO Victor Dodig, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. Chairman Prem Watsa and Cisco Systems Canada CEO Rola Dagher. As business leaders acknowledge the work that needs to be done within their companies, federal institutions are looking to make changes as well. Statistics Canada said it will start including information on race in its monthly employment reports starting in July after acknowledging the social, economic and labour impact of COVID-19 has not been equally felt by all Canadians. Meanwhile, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) said it recognizes there’s a lack of diversity in its ranks and said it will start reviewing all of its policies and practices through a racialized lens to eliminate discrimination at the federal housing agency. Many well-known brands are also starting to make changes to their business to become more inclusive. Johnson & Johnson Inc.’s Band-Aid recently said it will launch a range of products in “light, medium and deep shades of Brown and Black skin tones that embrace the beauty of diverse skin.” And Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian resigned from the company’s board of directors and urged for the company to replace him with a black candidate. “I believe resignation can actually be an act of leadership from people in power right now,” Ohanian wrote on Twitter. “To everyone fighting to fix our broken nation: do not stop.” Vancouver-based Aritzia Inc. also announced changes to address systemic racism and inequality from a corporate level. The retailer said in a statement earlier this month it would invest $1 million to expand their diversity and inclusion program.

For example, Calgary-based Righteous Gelato pulled its controversial Black Lives Matter frozen dessert less than a day after it was released. The specialty chocolate mint chip gelato featured a label depicting a Black Lives Matter protest, with face masks that read “I can’t breathe.” The company said it had launched the product with the intention of donating part of the sales, but it was widely panned on social media for being insensitive. It was only a matter of time before this egregious type of commodification of the struggle happened. I got to say though, if you’re going to be tone deaf and build a brand through controversy, go all the way. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/vXNNzRscVI — Eric Peters (@EricPetersAB) June 13, 2020 “If they had Black people helping with that in their senior suite, that wouldn’t have happened,” Hall said. “If consultants that they hired had Black people in senior positions, that wouldn’t have happened.” While some companies have taken steps to combat systemic racism, diversity and inclusion strategist Alden Habacon said they are still only at the start of cementing real change. “I feel like we're just at the beginning of the work. Most folks never get to the policy level,” said Habacon over email. When looking ahead, Hall said that companies need to identify barriers in their own businesses. In terms of how companies can actually address these barriers, Sojourner-Campbell said strategic policies will help. “The intuitional change will come through a sustained set of strategic policies, procedural changes if they need them and investing in an outlined process,” Sojourner-Campbell said. “Depending on the size of the organization, it may take a number of years and to phase in the necessary changes they have to make in order to live up to what they say they’re going to do.” Sojourner-Campbell added that businesses need to think of sustainability and continue the work needed to address systemic racism once protests come to an end. “I’m hoping that businesses are thinking about sustainability, because they’ve made their commitment publicly,” Sojourner-Campbell said. “They (companies) need to continue, they need to update the public with what they’re actually doing with substantive plans on what they’ve done, and what they intend to do – and keep that dialogue going after the protests to bring real change.” Related Mastercard promises to increase Black leadership by 50% by 2025 Microsoft to add US$150M on diversity, double black leaders Fed's first black president calls on policymakers to step up Pipeline & Politics 3:49 Keystone XL breaks ground in Canada in bid to ward off U.S. veto 8:05 Supreme Court dismisses First Nations' challenge against Trans Mountain 4:12 First Nations 'extremely disappointed' by SCC's Trans Mountain ruling 6:34 Boosting economic growth with millions of new green jobs 7:49 Supreme Court's decision to decline to hear First Nations appeal is a 'setback to consultations': Lawyer 3:42 SCC dismisses Trans Mountain appeal Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2020 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Its actions suggest there’s some worry. In the same budget update that forecast a $343 billion deficit, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced a significant shift in strategy toward issuing longer-dated bonds -- a tacit acknowledgment the rising debt levels are making the nation’s finances more vulnerable to any rise in interest rates. The idea is to lock in as debt at current borrowing costs for as long as possible, to ensure public debt charges don’t surge in the future. With federal debt surpassing $1 trillion for the first time ever, the risk is real. Rates are at historic lows today because of the global recession, but a recovery will drive them higher. If interest costs on public debt simply return to last year’s levels -- when they equaled 3.4 per cent of debt -- Ottawa’s interest payments would nearly double, according to Bloomberg calculations. That’s not taking into account the likelihood that large deficits will continue for years. “The complacency is incredible since many pundits say the sustainability is solid because of ultra-low interest rates,” said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. “The problem with that is the low interest rate regime reflects a future of very weak nominal growth, which in turn points to ever-weaker revenue generation.” For now, the government emphasizes that borrowing is cheap. With rates falling to all-time lows, federal public debt charges are forecast to decline this year to just under $20 billion -- the lowest since the 1980s -- despite the enormous deficit.

Nor is Canada an outlier in a world of rising government debt. Everyone is borrowing. The Bank of Canada, meanwhile, has been willing to mop up a lot of government bonds, via the creation of new money, easing financing strains on Trudeau’s government. The central bank is on a path to buy about $300 billion worth of bonds this fiscal year through its Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) Program, and it continues to purchase 13 per cent of all primary market offerings of nominal bonds, TD Securities said. “Even after our historic investments, Canada will continue to hold its low-debt advantage,” Morneau told lawmakers Wednesday in Ottawa. “This, combined with historically low interest rates, gave us the balance sheet to deploy our fiscal firepower to support Canadians through this.” But in the debt management strategy of the budget document, the finance department sounds less sanguine. The federal government announced plans to sell $106 billion of 10-year and 30-year bonds in the fiscal year that ends March 31, according to budget documents released Wednesday. That’s more than six times the $17 billion of such bonds it sold last year as the government fights the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and shows the government’s desire not to be too dependent on shorter-term debt that would need to be refinanced in the next several years. The coming flood of new long-term bonds pushed down the value of existing 10- and 30-year debt, with yields on the latter rising to nearly 1.1 per cent on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data. The benchmark 30-year Canada bond was trading at a yield of 1.066 per cent on Thursday at 8:25 a.m. Ottawa time, up about 8 basis points from Tuesday afternoon. The government expects gross bond issuance of $409 billion this year. The total bond stock is projected to increase 53 per cent to $915 billion. The stock of Treasury bills is set to rise 94 per cent to $294 billion. Foreign debt issuance will reach $26 billion, $10 billion more than at the end of March.

""As our province carefully moves towards recovery, the [emergency order] to temporarily allow for cannabis retail curbside pick-up and delivery will end when the declaration of emergency expires along with other temporary measures that had been put in place to support people and business during the public health emergency,"" said Richard Clark, communications director for Ontario's Finance Minister, in an email to BNN Bloomberg. Clark added licensed cannabis retail stores are able to reopen with measures to allow physical distancing, such as limiting the number of customers that can enter the store. Cannabis stores in the country's biggest consumer market were allowed to open and provide additional services such as delivery in April following an emergency order approved by the provincial cabinet amid the COVID-19 pandemic. There are more than 100 licensed cannabis stores open in Ontario, with more than 400 applications being reviewed by the provincial regulator. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, sales of cannabis have spiked in Canada as customers stocked up on licensed offerings. However, the decision to end delivery is likely to hurt smaller licensed retailers who have relied on that additional service to better compete with the illicit market, which still accounts for about 80 per cent of all cannabis household spending. Joey Khan, a manager for Bonnefire, a Toronto-based cannabis retail store that opened in March, days before the province declared an emergency due to COVID-19, said delivery and curbside pickup services accounted for about 30 per cent of the business' revenue. ""It's really unfair given the sensitivities of some of my customers who are still not able to come outside because of COVID-19,"" he said in a phone interview. ""Are they going to go back to the illegal market?"" The Ontario Cannabis Store, which is a crown corporation owned by the province, began offering free delivery to customers who purchase legal pot online in April. A spokesperson from the OCS wasn't immediately available for comment on whether that service would continue in light of the government's decision.

Its actions suggest there’s some worry. In the same budget update that forecast a $343 billion deficit, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced a significant shift in strategy toward issuing longer-dated bonds -- a tacit acknowledgment the rising debt levels are making the nation’s finances more vulnerable to any rise in interest rates. The idea is to lock in as debt at current borrowing costs for as long as possible, to ensure public debt charges don’t surge in the future. With federal debt surpassing $1 trillion for the first time ever, the risk is real. Rates are at historic lows today because of the global recession, but a recovery will drive them higher. If interest costs on public debt simply return to last year’s levels -- when they equaled 3.4 per cent of debt -- Ottawa’s interest payments would nearly double, according to Bloomberg calculations. That’s not taking into account the likelihood that large deficits will continue for years. “The complacency is incredible since many pundits say the sustainability is solid because of ultra-low interest rates,” said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. “The problem with that is the low interest rate regime reflects a future of very weak nominal growth, which in turn points to ever-weaker revenue generation.” For now, the government emphasizes that borrowing is cheap. With rates falling to all-time lows, federal public debt charges are forecast to decline this year to just under $20 billion -- the lowest since the 1980s -- despite the enormous deficit.

Nor is Canada an outlier in a world of rising government debt. Everyone is borrowing. The Bank of Canada, meanwhile, has been willing to mop up a lot of government bonds, via the creation of new money, easing financing strains on Trudeau’s government. The central bank is on a path to buy about $300 billion worth of bonds this fiscal year through its Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) Program, and it continues to purchase 13 per cent of all primary market offerings of nominal bonds, TD Securities said. “Even after our historic investments, Canada will continue to hold its low-debt advantage,” Morneau told lawmakers Wednesday in Ottawa. “This, combined with historically low interest rates, gave us the balance sheet to deploy our fiscal firepower to support Canadians through this.” But in the debt management strategy of the budget document, the finance department sounds less sanguine. The federal government announced plans to sell $106 billion of 10-year and 30-year bonds in the fiscal year that ends March 31, according to budget documents released Wednesday. That’s more than six times the $17 billion of such bonds it sold last year as the government fights the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and shows the government’s desire not to be too dependent on shorter-term debt that would need to be refinanced in the next several years. The coming flood of new long-term bonds pushed down the value of existing 10- and 30-year debt, with yields on the latter rising to nearly 1.1 per cent on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data. The benchmark 30-year Canada bond was trading at a yield of 1.066 per cent on Thursday at 8:25 a.m. Ottawa time, up about 8 basis points from Tuesday afternoon. The government expects gross bond issuance of $409 billion this year. The total bond stock is projected to increase 53 per cent to $915 billion. The stock of Treasury bills is set to rise 94 per cent to $294 billion. Foreign debt issuance will reach $26 billion, $10 billion more than at the end of March.

In the three months through June, 27 firms were granted protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, a federal law that gives insolvent corporations that have debt of more than $5 million an opportunity to restructure and avoid liquidation. That’s the most in any quarter since 2009, which is as far back as the data are available, according to the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. May and June saw 10 and 12 orders granting protection, respectively, under the CCAA. The average since 2009 is three a month. Previously, the highest monthly total was nine, in December 2011. Companies “are saying ‘times are tough, it’s not over yet, I just need some breathing room,’” Henry Louis, founder of Insolvency Insider, an industry website, said in an interview. Retailers Reitmans Canada Ltd. and Aldo Group Inc., as well as cannabis firms Beleave Inc. and Green Growth Brands Inc. were among the companies that received CCAA protection in the second quarter. While the CCAA applies to larger companies, a similar trend appears to be underway in the broader corporate sector, despite the fact that official data show a decline. The primary avenue for troubled companies of any size to seek protection from creditors is to make a proposal under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and these types of proposals have plunged in the past two months. But, according to Louis, an increasing number of companies are filing so-called Notices of Intention -- the formal first step in the process, and one that gives the company immediate creditor protection and at least 30 days to prepare a proposal, a period that can be extended. That suggests official insolvencies among companies of all sizes are poised to rise soon.

In a letter to Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau and other cabinet members, the airline’s chief medical officer suggested loosening quarantine requirements through “a science-based approach” to strike a balance between economic and public health concerns. In following some countries in Europe and Asia, Canada would enable a “measured restart of aviation,” he said. “Canada has made virtually no change to its quarantine restrictions since mid-March, despite continuing improvements containing the spread of the virus both in our country and in many others,” Jim Chung wrote. “This is severely impacting Air Canada, our customers and employees as well as an overall recovery.” The publicly-shared letter is the latest attempt by the country’s biggest air carrier to sway Trudeau, who has resisted crafting specific rescue plans for struggling airlines. Last month, Chief Executive Officer Calin Rovinescu called Canadian rules “disproportionate” for a country where the pandemic has been easing. Garneau’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The worst of the pandemic seems to have passed for now in Canada, where provincial governments are weeks into reopening their economies, while urging citizens to wear masks to avoid a second wave. The country has suffered nearly 8,800 virus deaths so far, but only about 650 in the past month. While the border with the U.S. remains closed, the European Union has put Canada on a list of exempt countries, a measure Canada has not reciprocated. Trudeau’s government has extended rules prohibiting most foreign nationals from entering as tourists. Anyone entering the country must quarantine for 14 days. Air Canada said it’s not suggesting reopening the border with the U.S., where the COVID-19 situation is still critical. Yet Chung said Canada could establish a list of exempt countries deemed low-risk, from where travelers wouldn’t need to self-isolate upon arrival. For countries that don’t qualify, Canada could use a test-based model that might help shorten quarantine requirements. Versions of that have been used by countries including Iceland and South Korea, Chung said.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan says policymakers need to take into account the unprecedented impact this downturn has had on women and Canadian households. “There’s no recovery without a ‘she-covery,’ and no recovery without childcare,” Yalnizyan told BNN Bloomberg in a phone interview. “It is mathematically impossible to have a GDP or jobs recovery without getting more women back to work.” “If we permit a significant share of the childcare ecosystem to collapse, then we are looking at a cascade of effects which I think would lead to an economic depression and continued prolonged contraction of the economy.” A report released Thursday by RBC Economics stated that women’s participation in the labour force was at historically high levels leading up to the pandemic, but has since plunged to levels not seen in more than 30 years. Despite absorbing 51 per cent of job losses in March and April, women accounted for only 45 per cent of the job gains seen in May and June as lockdown restrictions eased. According to RBC’s analysis of Statistics Canada data collected between March and June, women’s unemployment surpassed that of men, a feat that has not occurred in more than three decades. RBC found that a key reason behind the trend is that women are predominant in industries which bore the brunt of the shutdowns: travel, food services, retail, education and social assistance. We recognized that the burden of this challenge falls disproportionately on women,” he added. The RBC report added that “motherhood is a critical factor in the job picture as women shoulder a greater share of the burden of childcare.” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem’s prepared remarks, delivered after the central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, referenced that “many people may find it hard to return to work particularly if schools and child-care facilities cannot fully reopen.” The report said employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per-cent drop for their male counterparts. Employment declines for single mothers were even more significant at 12 per cent. RBC found that StatsCan data indicated women were significantly more likely to fall out of the labour force, adding that half of the women who lost their jobs between February and May were not actively looking for work. Yalnizyan said a combination of child-rearing and some home-schooling is adding to these women’s workloads. “They’re doing someone else’s paid work but at home,” she said Yalnizyan is calling for a federally-led solution to safely re-open schools and daycares that lays out exact protocol for handling potential virus cases. “We wasted our spring not getting ready for this,” she said.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Canada News Wire 5h ago Trudeau expands employment benefits; CERB to be phased out Kait Bolongaro , Bloomberg News Justin Trudeau speaks during an Ottawa news conference on July 16, 2020. , Bloomberg Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday unveiled a plan to wind down his flagship COVID-19 income support benefit and bring recipients into an expanded employment insurance system. At a press conference in Ottawa, Trudeau said the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit will be phased out as the first people to receive the $2,000 (US$1,494) monthly payments start losing eligibility at the end of August. Those who don’t immediately qualify for employment benefits will receive a stipend while the government reworks the country’s employment system. “Here’s the bottom line: we intend to cover every Canadian looking for work with a better 21st-century employment insurance system. That is our goal,” he said, adding that details will be released by the end of next month. The move is part of an effort by the government to wean Canadians off the monthly aid and get them back into the workforce -- a delicate task for the governing Liberals. Pushing people off too quickly could come at a political cost and hamper the economic recovery. Moving too slowly could be just as risky, giving people a disincentive to get back to work. As of June, only 40 per cent of the 3 million jobs lost in March and April had been recovered. About 8.5 million Canadians, more than 40 per cent of the labor force, received at least one CERB payment. The program has already delivered $63 billion in benefits. Trudeau said premiums for employment coverage wouldn’t increase during the crisis.

At a press conference in Ottawa, Trudeau said the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit will be phased out as the first people to receive the $2,000 (US$1,494) monthly payments start losing eligibility at the end of August. Those who don’t immediately qualify for employment benefits will receive a stipend while the government reworks the country’s employment system. “Here’s the bottom line: we intend to cover every Canadian looking for work with a better 21st-century employment insurance system. That is our goal,” he said, adding that details will be released by the end of next month. The move is part of an effort by the government to wean Canadians off the monthly aid and get them back into the workforce -- a delicate task for the governing Liberals. Pushing people off too quickly could come at a political cost and hamper the economic recovery. Moving too slowly could be just as risky, giving people a disincentive to get back to work. As of June, only 40 per cent of the 3 million jobs lost in March and April had been recovered. About 8.5 million Canadians, more than 40 per cent of the labor force, received at least one CERB payment. The program has already delivered $63 billion in benefits. Trudeau said premiums for employment coverage wouldn’t increase during the crisis.

This means cooperation between employers and employees will become paramount to navigating the new school year, some experts say. “With all moments of change, transparency and communication will win the day,” Louise Taylor Green, CEO of the Human Resources Professionals Association (HRPA), told BNN Bloomberg in an email. “I encourage HR and CEOs to establish clear paths to communication and create an environment where parents feel they can share their struggles and will be supported and not reprimanded or judged.” One firm that has tried to be flexible during the pandemic is the Canadian arm of personal services firm Accenture. Even though Accenture as a whole is in the process of reducing its global workforce, its Canadian business, which has approximately 5,000 employees, is giving parents some options as children head back to school. “With the back-to-school season in mind, we are providing an additional 240 hours of backup crisis care between now and December 31. This program gives parents the option to be reimbursed up to $100 a day to have a caregiver of their choosing, such as an extended family member or a friend, come into their home to provide care,” Jeffrey Russell, president of Accenture Canada, said in an email. In addition, Accenture Canada is continuing to offer 80 hours of backup care per year for times when regular arrangements fall through. RELATED From masks to cohorting, a guide to back-to-school rules across the country How students can ease the burden of school costs during a global pandemic Feds to give provinces $2B to bolster safe reopening of schools Beyond what employers can offer during these complicated times, human rights legislation across Canada does provide protection to workers on the basis of family status, according to Janine Liberatore, partner at Hunter Liberatore Law. “If an employee has to care for a child or parent because the child cannot attend school or daycare or suitable alternative care is not available due to COVID-19, then the employee may request a family status accommodation,” she said in an email. “The accommodation can include a work-from-home arrangement. If that is not available, then an accommodation in the form of a leave of absence may be the appropriate solution.” Liberatore also points to measures the federal government has now put in place to replace the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) that could become useful in some specific scenarios. These measures include: the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) for employees who are unable to work because they are caring for a child, dependent and/or family member due to COVID-19-related school or daycare closures, as well as the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) for workers who are sick or must self-isolate because of the virus. Employment lawyer John Hyde, who is founding partner at Hyde HR Law, agrees that collaboration between employers and employees to find common ground and practical solutions is especially important right now, considering that employees help drive the success of most businesses. As a result, he believes that smart employers will try to be as accommodating as possible. At the same time, he said employees also need to be understanding of the employer’s position. He noted the practices we have gotten used to, and the way in which many companies operated previously, will not be the same when we eventually emerge from this pandemic – and that this could have bigger implications for workers. “The one thing that the pandemic is teaching employers is how to cope with less, and do more with less. But that also means less employees,” Hyde said. “Do not be surprised that, as this pandemic wanes, large organizations – banks, national and multinational corporations – will be shedding employee jobs. Those employees not willing to be reasonable during the pandemic, will likely be the first ones to go.” Q&A: Top questions Ontario employment lawyer John Hyde has received from working parents Q: I want my children to stay at home doing online learning and homeschool until it is safe. Can I demand that my employer allow me to work from home? A: Working from home is not an automatic right. Before an employee can demand that he or she work from home for the purposes of childcare, the employee has to establish that all other options have been considered and/or has attempted to make alternative arrangements for childcare, without success. -Employees have to remember that they too have to be flexible. These are difficult times, and employers and employees have to work together toward solving these problems. -Some jobs are just simply not capable to be undertaken from the home. Q: I have been working from home during the pandemic. My employer just called me in to work, before school starts. Can I refuse? A: Possibly, however it depends on the circumstances. Part of the answer focuses upon whether the requirement to work from home was put into place as a temporary measure, or a permanent one. If the latter, such unilateral change may amount to a constructive wrongful dismissal. Additionally, the employee still must consider all available options for alternative childcare arrangements, before taking such position. Q: If I send my children to school and they get sick can I: Demand to work from home? A: Yes, you can, but within limits. Are there other arrangements you can make? If not, subject to the nature of the job, employees do have this right due to protections under the Human Rights Code of Ontario. That aside, employers should always give careful consideration to assisting employees in this difficult time. If the employee can combine work and childcare, smart employers will permit it, at least on a temporary basis. Take job-protected time off to look after my children? A: Yes. Family medical leave under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario provides for job protected leave of up to 28 weeks in a 52-week period. Family caregiver leave is also available. Critical illness leave provides job protected leave for up to 37 weeks, to care for a minor child.

In a decision Wednesday from Ottawa, policy makers led by Governor Tiff Macklem held the bank’s benchmark rate at 0.25 per cent and said they’ll leave it unchanged until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 per cent inflation target is “sustainably achieved.” The central bank also retained a pledge to buy government bonds at the current pace and maintain extraordinary monetary policy stimulus throughout what it calls the recuperation phase of the recovery. The accommodative stance is largely unchanged from the last policy statement in July, part of the central bank’s efforts to help pull Canada out of the deepest downturn since the Great Depression. At the same time, the bank indicated it’s prepared to make some alterations to policy by paring quantitative easing if needed. “The Bank was deliberately cryptic about its intentions in terms of modifying the QE program, as it doesn’t want to see yields spike higher and dull the stimulus low rates across the curve are delivering,” CIBC Chief Economist Avery Shenfeld said by email. “At some point, it will have to slow its purchases down to avoid owning too large a share of the outstanding issues.” The central bank removed language about being prepared to offer more stimulus if necessary. It also said bond purchases will be “calibrated” to provide the needed stimulus, which analysts speculated may be a signal Macklem is setting the stage to temper his reliance on purchases if massive holdings begin to overly shrink supply. Canada’s dollar rose 0.6 per cent to $1.3160 against the U.S. dollar at 11:50 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on government 10-year bonds rose 2 basis points to 0.59 per cent. The central bank’s commitment could keep the policy rate unchanged until at least 2023, based on forecasts released in July. But Macklem had indicated he may tinker with the asset purchase program before then. Balance Sheet Growth in the central bank’s balance sheet has already stalled at about $540 billion (US$410 billion) since mid July, or about 27 per cent of nominal GDP, as increased holdings of government bonds are offset by declining treasury bills. There is nothing in the statement, however, that indicates any adjustments will be imminent, and the central bank will be wary of doing anything that drives up yields. Policy makers on Wednesday said they will continue to purchase government bonds at the current pace “until the recovery is well underway.” They also said the economy is evolving broadly in line with their July forecasts. While the bounce back in the third quarter looks to be faster than anticipated, the 13 per cent decline in output in the first half of this year was as expected. At the same time, business confidence and investment remains “subdued,” with the recovery likely to be long and uncertain. What Bloomberg’s Economists Say “We expect the October meeting will show the bank’s central forecast scenario is on the pessimistic side. Yet faster-than-expected recuperation is unlikely to move the policy needle, as portions of the economy will not be healthy for an extended period.” --Andrew Husby “While recent data during the reopening phase is encouraging, the Bank continues to expect the recuperation phase to be slow and choppy as the economy copes with ongoing uncertainty and structural challenges,” according to the statement. One way to potentially ease off hard bond purchase guidance without spooking markets could be to introduce yield curve control, where the central bank targets a specific medium-term interest rate. That would allow it to purchase just enough bonds to keep rates on hold, without committing to a specific amount. Or the bank may simply acknowledge that as the economy recovers, fewer asset purchases will be needed, Shenfeld said. Some clarity could come Thursday when Macklem is scheduled to give a speech and press conference. The next rate decision is Oct. 28. --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.

The online retailer said Wednesday a new 79,400 square-metre warehouse adjacent to Hamilton's airport will have more than 1,500 employees who will pack and ship small items such as books, electronics and toys. A new 92,900 square-metre location east of Toronto in Ajax, Ont., will have more than 1,000 employees who will pack and ship large items such as sports equipment, patio furniture, pet food and other household goods. “We've had great success with the talented workforce in Ontario, and we look forward to creating an additional 2,500 full-time jobs with competitive pay and benefits starting on day one,” Sumegha Kumar, Amazon's director of Canadian customer fulfilment operations, said in a news release. The two new operations are expected to open in 2021. “This is the beginning of a strong partnership with Amazon Canada, and I look forward to our continued collaboration in the future,” Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger said. Ajax MPP Rod Phillips said the commitment is good for the Durham Region. “The 1,000 new, full-time jobs Amazon has committed to are coming at a crucial time. It is a good example of the kind of investment we need in Ontario as the economy recovers from COVID-19,” he stated. The new distribution centres bring Amazon's total to 10 in Ontario and 16 in Canada, including one in Leduc Country, south of Edmonton. Amazon also confirmed plans for five new delivery stations in Ontario including Kitchener, Stoney Creek, Vaughan and two in Toronto in the Etobicoke and Scarborough neighbourhoods. The announcement comes nearly two years after the company decided to spread its second headquarters over two U.S. cities and rejected a joint bid from Toronto and surrounding municipalities that were among the final contenders. The Competition Bureau last months launched a probe into Amazon's conduct to determine whether the online retailer is harming competition. Specifically, it is reviewing whether Amazon policies impact sellers' willingness to offer their products at a lower price on other retail channels, such as their own websites or rival online marketplaces. The bureau is also looking into any efforts by Amazon to tilt consumers toward its own products over those offered by competing vendors, as well as any disadvantage that sellers incur by opting out of Amazon's shipping, customer relations and advertising services. Amazon employs more than 21,000 employees in Canada.

This means cooperation between employers and employees will become paramount to navigating the new school year, some experts say. “With all moments of change, transparency and communication will win the day,” Louise Taylor Green, CEO of the Human Resources Professionals Association (HRPA), told BNN Bloomberg in an email. “I encourage HR and CEOs to establish clear paths to communication and create an environment where parents feel they can share their struggles and will be supported and not reprimanded or judged.” One firm that has tried to be flexible during the pandemic is the Canadian arm of professional services firm Accenture. Even though Accenture as a whole is in the process of reducing its global workforce, its Canadian business, which has approximately 5,000 employees, is giving parents some options as children head back to school. “With the back-to-school season in mind, we are providing an additional 240 hours of backup crisis care between now and December 31. This program gives parents the option to be reimbursed up to $100 a day to have a caregiver of their choosing, such as an extended family member or a friend, come into their home to provide care,” Jeffrey Russell, president of Accenture Canada, said in an email. In addition, Accenture Canada is continuing to offer 80 hours of backup care per year for times when regular arrangements fall through. RELATED From masks to cohorting, a guide to back-to-school rules across the country How students can ease the burden of school costs during a global pandemic Feds to give provinces $2B to bolster safe reopening of schools Beyond what employers can offer during these complicated times, human rights legislation across Canada does provide protection to workers on the basis of family status, according to Janine Liberatore, partner at Hunter Liberatore Law. “If an employee has to care for a child or parent because the child cannot attend school or daycare or suitable alternative care is not available due to COVID-19, then the employee may request a family status accommodation,” she said in an email. “The accommodation can include a work-from-home arrangement. If that is not available, then an accommodation in the form of a leave of absence may be the appropriate solution.” Liberatore also points to measures the federal government has now put in place to replace the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) that could become useful in some specific scenarios. These measures include: the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) for employees who are unable to work because they are caring for a child, dependent and/or family member due to COVID-19-related school or daycare closures, as well as the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) for workers who are sick or must self-isolate because of the virus. Employment lawyer John Hyde, who is founding partner at Hyde HR Law, agrees that collaboration between employers and employees to find common ground and practical solutions is especially important right now, considering that employees help drive the success of most businesses. As a result, he believes that smart employers will try to be as accommodating as possible. At the same time, he said employees also need to be understanding of the employer’s position. He noted the practices we have gotten used to, and the way in which many companies operated previously, will not be the same when we eventually emerge from this pandemic – and that this could have bigger implications for workers. “The one thing that the pandemic is teaching employers is how to cope with less, and do more with less. But that also means less employees,” Hyde said. “Do not be surprised that, as this pandemic wanes, large organizations – banks, national and multinational corporations – will be shedding employee jobs. Those employees not willing to be reasonable during the pandemic, will likely be the first ones to go.” Q&A: Top questions Ontario employment lawyer John Hyde has received from working parents Q: I want my children to stay at home doing online learning and homeschool until it is safe. Can I demand that my employer allow me to work from home? A: Working from home is not an automatic right. Before an employee can demand that he or she work from home for the purposes of childcare, the employee has to establish that all other options have been considered and/or has attempted to make alternative arrangements for childcare, without success. -Employees have to remember that they too have to be flexible. These are difficult times, and employers and employees have to work together toward solving these problems. -Some jobs are just simply not capable to be undertaken from the home. Q: I have been working from home during the pandemic. My employer just called me in to work, before school starts. Can I refuse? A: Possibly, however it depends on the circumstances. Part of the answer focuses upon whether the requirement to work from home was put into place as a temporary measure, or a permanent one. If the latter, such unilateral change may amount to a constructive wrongful dismissal. Additionally, the employee still must consider all available options for alternative childcare arrangements, before taking such position. Q: If I send my children to school and they get sick can I: Demand to work from home? A: Yes, you can, but within limits. Are there other arrangements you can make? If not, subject to the nature of the job, employees do have this right due to protections under the Human Rights Code of Ontario. That aside, employers should always give careful consideration to assisting employees in this difficult time. If the employee can combine work and childcare, smart employers will permit it, at least on a temporary basis. Take job-protected time off to look after my children? A: Yes. Family medical leave under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario provides for job protected leave of up to 28 weeks in a 52-week period. Family caregiver leave is also available. Critical illness leave provides job protected leave for up to 37 weeks, to care for a minor child.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Politics Sep 16, 2020 Latest immigration numbers highlight risk to Canada's recovery Shelly Hagan, Bloomberg News Immigration drop leads to concerns about economic recovery VIDEO SIGN OUT Canada’s immigration slump deepened in July, reflecting the impact of closed borders and highlighting a potential downside risk to the economy. The latest government data show Canada admitted 13,645 permanent residents in July, down 63 per cent from the same period last year as COVID-19 travel restrictions continue. July’s figures are in line with the nearly two-thirds drop between April and June, pouring cold water on hopes for a quick rebound. Immigration had been one of the main catalysts of Canada’s economic growth before the pandemic, a driver that looks increasingly under threat. Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino unveiled targets in March for 341,000 permanent residents this year, but through the first seven months only 34 per cent of that number had been granted entry. “It’s really depressed compared to last year and it seems unlikely to change anytime soon,” Andrew Agopsowicz, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said by phone, adding the July decline is “worrisome”. Agopsowicz predicts the country will meet 70 per cent of its 2020 targets, which would equate to 238,700 newcomers. Lower immigration could strain urban housing markets and result in reduced funding for post-secondary institutions, RBC said in a report last month. It could also hamper innovation. Study permits are showing a similar trend. In July, Canada issued 13,455 new study permits, down 59 per cent from 32,540 in the same period last year. Agopsowicz expects immigration to remain weak through the winter, with visa-application centers closed in many countries and travel restrictions still in place.

More Video Canada Sep 14, 2020 Hospitals warn of second lockdown as Ontario COVID-19 numbers rise The Canadian Press A worker wearing a protective mask cleans a railing at the Eaton Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on Wednesday, June 24, 2020. Canada's largest city has reopened restaurant patios, shops and swimming pools after officials determined that the Covid-19 virus is under control. Bloomberg/Cole Burston TORONTO - The head of the Ontario Hospital Association is warning that increasing COVID-19 case rates could lead to another provincial lockdown. OHA president Anthony Dale says the province's accelerating infections rates in Toronto, Peel and Ottawa could spread to the rest of Ontario if people don't respect public health guidelines. He says Ontario residents must practise physical distancing, wear masks when required, and neither host nor attend unsafe gatherings and parties. Dale says he is making the request of Ontario residents on behalf of hospital staff who are the anchor of the province's pandemic response. He says some people have been lulled into a false sense of security by case numbers which had been decreasing last month. His statement comes as Ontario's new case count increased for the fourth consecutive day, with 313 cases reported today along with one new death from the virus. The total number of cases in Ontario now stands at 44,817, which includes 2,816 deaths and 39,974 cases classified as resolved. Health Minister Christine Elliott says that nearly 80 per cent of Ontario's cases are from three regions. She says Toronto is reporting 112 cases, 71 in Peel and 60 in Ottawa. Elliott says that almost 70 per cent of today's cases are in people under the age of 40. Ontario reports two new cases of COVID-19 in schools, one in Mississauga and one in Pembroke, Ont., according to the government's website. Four school boards are also reporting new cases of COVID-19 not posted on the government page. Halton District School Board has two new cases, according to its COVID-19 advisory page Meanwhile, Ontario's legislature returns to Queen's Park for its fall session on Monday, but with the COVID-19 pandemic still affecting daily life, the Progressive Conservative government's house leader said it will not be business as usual. Paul Calandra said the legislature will continue to respect public health rules while returning to its regular four-day-a-week schedule for proceedings. He said the government will be focused in the coming weeks on the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy, school reopenings, and the health-care system. Calandra says Ontario's 2020-2021 budget - which was delayed by the pandemic - will be delivered on Nov. 15. The government is also expected to table a formal report on the state of emergency declared by the province earlier this year in response to the pandemic. Calandra said the government is also leaving itself leeway in the legislative schedule in case it needs to introduce additional legislation to address COVID-19 this fall. “We're seeing the (COVID-19 case) numbers are creeping up so if we get into a second wave, we want to be able to react quickly,” Calandra said in an interview. “Should time be needed on the legislative schedule to pass bills, we're building that in.” In March, the Progressive Conservative government said its deficit would reach $20.5 billion by the end of 2020-2021. But in August, Finance Minister Rod Phillips said that due to billions more in spending required by the ongoing pandemic, the number is set to reach $38.5 billion. Calandra said the government will ensure the health-care system gets needed funding and that small and medium-sized businesses also receive support this fall. “Even for hard-core fiscal conservatives like me, we know that this is a time when you make investments for people ... but at the same time, you fix those areas that you can fix and improve your response,” he said. “So, I think you'll start to see a lot more of that.” NDP legislator Marit Stiles said the official Opposition will focus on pressing the government for smaller class sizes, overhauling long-term care, and job creation. “Returning to normal is just not going to be good enough,” Stiles said. “This pandemic has shown where we have these giant gaps, whether it's in long-term care or education or those folks who have low wages, unstable jobs.” While politicians will return to the legislature Monday until the house rises again in December, the building remains closed to the public. Visitors will not be permitted in the spectator galleries of the house because of the pandemic.

Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland held a call with chief executives from the nation’s biggest banks on Thursday to discuss the economic outlook and potential policy steps. She was told that while low interest rates provide some scope to borrow more in coming years to support the recovery, it’s imperative the government recommit to specific new debt targets to impose discipline on the budgeting process, according to one person familiar with the discussion. Freeland, who became finance minister last month after Bill Morneau stepped down, was also urged to put new spending into productivity-enhancing measures, like childcare. Officials from Freeland’s department have received a similar message during recent consultations with bank economists, who agree new spending should be focused on increasing productivity, rather than simply stoking consumer demand. “There’s no specific line in the sand for how high the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio can go, but the sky is not the limit,” Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone. “Governments shouldn’t unnecessarily test the limits.” After naming Freeland to the finance post, Trudeau signaled he plans to keep deficits historically elevated for years, promising ambitious new spending to drive the recovery and fill in gaps in social safety nets exposed by the virus. The prime minister is expected to unveil elements of the plan in a Sept. 23 parliamentary address. That would be on top of the US$380 billion in new debt already budgeted this year as a response to the downturn, spending that will likely drive the federal government’s debt to about 50 per cent of economic output, from 31 per cent last year. The debt ratio could jump to as high as 65 per cent without jeopardizing Canada’s status as one of the least indebted governments in the Group of Seven, Bank of Nova Scotia economists Jean-François Perrault and Rebekah Young said Monday in a report. That would give the federal government scope to run deficits of another half trillion dollars over the next three years. But that would need to come with a hard commitment to bring the debt burden down gradually in order to ease concern about the nation’s fiscal path, they said, possibly by introducing legislation to force the government to lower its debt ratio. The spending should seek to address low female labor force participation and weak investment and productivity. The current pivot in fiscal policy offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make bolder investments to “tackle some of the really big structural impediments to mediocre growth potential in Canada such as chronic productivity deficits,” Young, director of fiscal economics at Scotiabank, said by phone. RELATED Trudeau could play electoral split on large deficits to his advantage Justin Trudeau plots Canada's sharpest turn left in economic policy in decades As Freeland takes finance job, crisis will dictate spending plans, experts say Perrault and Young recommended new funding to help families pay for childcare, which would boost female labor force participation, increase disposable income and boost housing affordability. They also suggested temporary matching grants of about 25 per cent for businesses that invest in machinery, equipment and intellectual property. “As Canada’s fiscal policy shifts this fall, arguably composition matters as much, if not more, than quantum alone,” Young said. The focus on growth-enhancing spending measures is important because the economy is expected to rebound over the next two years, making the case for additional emergency stimulus weaker. “Frankly, I am a little bit concerned about some of the messaging we’ve heard from Ottawa in recent weeks about using this ‘golden opportunity’ to launch all kinds of new spending,” Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone. “We have made a pretty big recovery in the last three or four months already. We should be well past the peak of spending.” Another point of broad agreement is the need to reestablish a fiscal anchor, mostly because demand for Canadian government debt -- which is currently keeping interest rates low -- isn’t boundless. The surge in government debt also makes Canada more vulnerable to future shocks, particularly since the country is sitting on one of the largest household debt burdens in the world. Some believe government debt is already near what should be maximum levels. I’d like to hear “overall guidance that they want the debt to GDP ratio moving lower,” Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said by phone. “And I’d like to hear some discussion, many years out, that they would eventually like to get back to balance.” The Trump Administration 4:00 Oracle would get access to TikTok's crown jewels in deal 6:36 OECD cautions on fiscal tightening 6:49 Canada did 'phenomenally good' navigating aluminum tariffs: Canadian American Business Council CEO 8:56 Grenell Criticizes China’s Role in WTO 7:44 How Would Japan's Leadership Change Affect Ties With U.S.? 1:27 ByteDance Won’t Sell Tiktok’s Algorithm, SCMP Reports 4:46 Pandemic marks end of going door to door for votes 3:23 Time is running out for TikTok U.S. sale Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2020 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

In a decision Wednesday from Ottawa, policy makers led by Governor Tiff Macklem held the bank’s benchmark rate at 0.25 per cent and said they’ll leave it unchanged until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 per cent inflation target is “sustainably achieved.” The central bank also retained a pledge to buy government bonds at the current pace and maintain extraordinary monetary policy stimulus throughout what it calls the recuperation phase of the recovery. The accommodative stance is largely unchanged from the last policy statement in July, part of the central bank’s efforts to help pull Canada out of the deepest downturn since the Great Depression. At the same time, the bank indicated it’s prepared to make some alterations to policy by paring quantitative easing if needed. “The Bank was deliberately cryptic about its intentions in terms of modifying the QE program, as it doesn’t want to see yields spike higher and dull the stimulus low rates across the curve are delivering,” CIBC Chief Economist Avery Shenfeld said by email. “At some point, it will have to slow its purchases down to avoid owning too large a share of the outstanding issues.” The central bank removed language about being prepared to offer more stimulus if necessary. It also said bond purchases will be “calibrated” to provide the needed stimulus, which analysts speculated may be a signal Macklem is setting the stage to temper his reliance on purchases if massive holdings begin to overly shrink supply. Canada’s dollar rose 0.6 per cent to $1.3160 against the U.S. dollar at 11:50 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on government 10-year bonds rose 2 basis points to 0.59 per cent. The central bank’s commitment could keep the policy rate unchanged until at least 2023, based on forecasts released in July. But Macklem had indicated he may tinker with the asset purchase program before then. Balance Sheet Growth in the central bank’s balance sheet has already stalled at about $540 billion (US$410 billion) since mid July, or about 27 per cent of nominal GDP, as increased holdings of government bonds are offset by declining treasury bills. There is nothing in the statement, however, that indicates any adjustments will be imminent, and the central bank will be wary of doing anything that drives up yields. Policy makers on Wednesday said they will continue to purchase government bonds at the current pace “until the recovery is well underway.” They also said the economy is evolving broadly in line with their July forecasts. While the bounce back in the third quarter looks to be faster than anticipated, the 13 per cent decline in output in the first half of this year was as expected. At the same time, business confidence and investment remains “subdued,” with the recovery likely to be long and uncertain. What Bloomberg’s Economists Say “We expect the October meeting will show the bank’s central forecast scenario is on the pessimistic side. Yet faster-than-expected recuperation is unlikely to move the policy needle, as portions of the economy will not be healthy for an extended period.” --Andrew Husby “While recent data during the reopening phase is encouraging, the Bank continues to expect the recuperation phase to be slow and choppy as the economy copes with ongoing uncertainty and structural challenges,” according to the statement. One way to potentially ease off hard bond purchase guidance without spooking markets could be to introduce yield curve control, where the central bank targets a specific medium-term interest rate. That would allow it to purchase just enough bonds to keep rates on hold, without committing to a specific amount. Or the bank may simply acknowledge that as the economy recovers, fewer asset purchases will be needed, Shenfeld said. Some clarity could come Thursday when Macklem is scheduled to give a speech and press conference. The next rate decision is Oct. 28. --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.

More Video Technology Company News Sep 9, 2020 Amazon to open two new distribution centres in Ontario The Canadian Press Notable Calls: Amazon, Eli Lilly and Peloton VIDEO SIGN OUT Security Not Found The stock symbol {{StockChart.Ric}} does not exist See Full Stock Page » TORONTO - Amazon.com plans to open two new distribution centres in Ontario that will create more than 2,500 new full-time jobs. The online retailer said Wednesday a new 79,400 square-metre warehouse adjacent to Hamilton's airport will have more than 1,500 employees who will pack and ship small items such as books, electronics and toys. A new 92,900 square-metre location east of Toronto in Ajax, Ont., will have more than 1,000 employees who will pack and ship large items such as sports equipment, patio furniture, pet food and other household goods. “We've had great success with the talented workforce in Ontario, and we look forward to creating an additional 2,500 full-time jobs with competitive pay and benefits starting on day one,” Sumegha Kumar, Amazon's director of Canadian customer fulfilment operations, said in a news release. The two new operations are expected to open in 2021. “This is the beginning of a strong partnership with Amazon Canada, and I look forward to our continued collaboration in the future,” Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger said. Ajax MPP Rod Phillips said the commitment is good for the Durham Region. “The 1,000 new, full-time jobs Amazon has committed to are coming at a crucial time. It is a good example of the kind of investment we need in Ontario as the economy recovers from COVID-19,” he stated. The new distribution centres bring Amazon's total to 10 in Ontario and 16 in Canada, including one in Leduc Country, south of Edmonton. Amazon also confirmed plans for five new delivery stations in Ontario including Kitchener, Stoney Creek, Vaughan and two in Toronto in the Etobicoke and Scarborough neighbourhoods. The announcement comes nearly two years after the company decided to spread its second headquarters over two U.S. cities and rejected a joint bid from Toronto and surrounding municipalities that were among the final contenders. The Competition Bureau last months launched a probe into Amazon's conduct to determine whether the online retailer is harming competition. Specifically, it is reviewing whether Amazon policies impact sellers' willingness to offer their products at a lower price on other retail channels, such as their own websites or rival online marketplaces. The bureau is also looking into any efforts by Amazon to tilt consumers toward its own products over those offered by competing vendors, as well as any disadvantage that sellers incur by opting out of Amazon's shipping, customer relations and advertising services. Amazon employs more than 21,000 employees in Canada.

More Video Personal Finance Economics 10h ago Time to get your financial house in order as CERB winds down: Pattie Lovett-Reid By Pattie Lovett-Reid Pattie Lovett-Reid: Tips for finding a job during a pandemic VIDEO SIGN OUT Pattie Lovett-Reid Chief Financial Commentator, CTV Follow|Archive COVID-19 has decimated our employment landscape and sadly, we aren't through the pandemic. As cases across the country continue to climb, the fear of a second wave and an additional knock to the economy is all too real. In the recent throne speech, the federal government offered up some support by the way of extending its Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) program to assist businesses with covering fixed costs as part of a plan to create one million jobs. Jobs are key in my opinion. Sign up for BNN Bloomberg's new weekly newsletter, Home Economics, here: https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/subscribe Small businesses are struggling and we still have one million fewer people employed than we did prior to the pandemic. Add to this, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) as we know comes to an end on Sept. 26, at which time the following is expected to happen: 1. The government is expected to transition to a modified EI program on Sept. 27 2. The government has telegraphed that it’s launching three new temporary recovery benefits covering self-employed, sickness and caregivers who in the past may not have been covered by EI. 3. The EI eligibility requirement has been lowered to 120 insurable hours across Canada 4. The majority of CERB recipients will be automatically transitioned to EI. 5. Ottawa plans to increase the value of weekly benefits for unemployed workers to $500 a week These measures are temporary and will be only in place for a year. While the window may be closing, there is still time to get your financial house in order. The key to getting our economy back on track – in other words, moving from survival mode to a place where you’re thriving – is getting people back to work. This will require education and, in many cases, retraining. However, it’s tough to compete in today's competitive environment, so how do you stand out from the crowd? I reached out to Pino Addesa, recruitment director at The Staffing Alternative, on how to position yourself and your resume as you look for new opportunities. Here’s what he said: 1. Keep your resume short and simple. That means two pages maximum. Cut out the fat; less is more. 2. Proof read your resume before submitting it. Even if you have the right skills, some employers will automatically discount your profile if they find a spelling or grammar error on a resume. 3. A resume should always be in chronological order from the most recent work experience to past work experience. 4. Before applying for a job, ensure you have the requirements in terms of hard and soft skills, and ensure they are effectively communicated on your resume. 5. Provide and showcase metrics on your resume to help tell your story. In other words, what have you done to make a difference or a financial impact on the business. We need to focus on job creation and promotion of business investment. The recovery is clearly going to be uneven – and certain sectors are going to struggle and take much longer to recover than others. In the meantime, try to control what you can. Finding a job right now isn't about finding your dream job. It’s more about creating some financial flexibility in your life – and that means taking advantage of every opportunity to stand out from the crowd.

In an interview with BNN Bloomberg’s Amanda Lang broadcast Thursday, Siddall said that while the most bearish case for home prices doesn’t seem likely to come to pass, he still sees a price decline by just shy of 10 per cent due to the economic shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The number of people on income support, the number of people on mortgage deferral, means that at some point, probably early next year through the middle part of next year, there will probably be a negative adjustment in house prices,” he said. “In general, we think high single-digit [percentage] negative adjustment is what we can expect in most markets.” The CMHC had released a forecast in May warning average home prices in the country could plunge as much as 18 per cent in a worst-case scenario due to the pandemic and its impact on economic growth, employment and lost income. Siddall told BNN Bloomberg various income-support measures implemented by the federal government has helped the Canadian housing market avoid that worst-case scenario. RELATED 'Housing Canada'?: CMHC getting new name to reflect changing mandate CMHC draws fire for tightening mortgage rules Siddall's stark warning on Canada mortgages wins CDIC support “This is very much a path-dependent forecast. That was a ‘the pandemic was going to be horrible, deep,’ and it’s been pretty bad, but government income support, government fiscal support, government monetary policy support have helped alleviate some of those pressures,” he said. However, Siddall warned that the looming reduction of federal support will lead to higher unemployment and further lost income, deflating home prices. “Ultimately, what it does is it requires economic adjustment and in some businesses, there will be unemployment that results,” he said. “And unemployment is the kind of thing that drives prices lower.” Related New home prices in Canada jump most in three years on lumber Home prices could fall 7% in 2021, hitting Prairies hard: Moody's Top Stories 10:02 House prices will fall even if worst-case scenario averted: CMHC Housing boom in U.S. threatened by shortage of available homes Brooklyn is hot with NYC homebuyers seeking bang for the buck Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2020 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

It might not be enough to stave off an election. In one of the most anticipated speeches of Trudeau’s five years in power, the prime minister outlined plans to keep the fiscal taps open to surmount short-term challenges. He also used the address to lay out a list of longer-term policy plans, including a national daycare system, pharmacare and more spending on housing and the environment. It’s a far-reaching and potentially expensive agenda that poses a major risk for Trudeau, since the governing Liberals lack a majority in the legislature. If he can’t win support for the plan from at least one opposition party over the next week, Canada will be headed for elections. READ MORE: THRONE SPEECH 5 highlights from the throne speech 'An ambitious plan': Reaction to the government’s throne speech Trudeau stresses green tech in Governor General's speech from the throne “This is not the time for austerity,” the government said in the so-called Throne Speech, which was delivered in the Senate Chamber by Governor General Julie Payette. The first need “is to help Canadians in the short term, to do whatever it takes.” As of late Wednesday, none of the three main opposition parties had expressed support for the plan. The main rival Conservatives said they were opposed. The third-largest party, Bloc Quebecois, said Trudeau didn’t heed calls from provinces for more health-care spending. Left-leaning New Democrats said their demands for more access to paid leave and an end to planned reductions in unemployment benefits weren’t met. A vote on the speech could take place as early as next week. A loss for Trudeau would trigger an election. “We will have to wait for a while before we know whether they will vote in favor of the speech in the forthcoming confidence vote, which will decide whether we have fall elections or not,” said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. Campaign Platform The 17-page speech was laden with promises, more akin to a campaign platform than the two-year legislative agenda typically presented in a Throne Speech. Immediate steps include extending the emergency wage subsidy program until next summer and expanding credit facilities for companies, as well as more targeted support for the hardest hit industries. These measures would be part of a campaign to create 1 million jobs in Canada, returning employment to pre-pandemic levels, according to Trudeau’s address. “I was surprised at the specificity of the language across the board on commitments,” Rebekah Young, an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by phone. “Everything was there.” The government’s promise to extend the wage subsidy could cost around $40 billion, while the drug and daycare plans could add another $20 billion annually, Young said. Canada’s currency extended declines after the speech began, closing the session at C$1.3381 against its U.S. counterpart, down 0.6%. WEIGH IN How do you feel about Canada’s economic outlook after the throne speech? Results Total Results: 0 The government already projects a budget deficit equal to 16% of gross domestic product this year, the widest since World War II. Credit rating agencies and investors including BlackRock Inc. want hard details on how he plans to pull Canada back from a record borrowing binge. Those details were absent from the address. Trudeau included a section in the speech on “fiscal sustainability,” pledging to preserve Canada’s advantage and be guided by “values of sustainability and prudence.” The government pledged to outline its economic and fiscal position in a fall budget update. But Trudeau also pledged to use “whatever fiscal firepower” is needed to surmount short-term challenges. One of those will be a second wave of the virus. The prime minister told Canadians during an evening televised address the four largest provinces are seeing a fresh outbreak, saying there were 47 new cases of COVID-19 on March 13 when the country went into lockdown. “Yesterday alone, we had well over 1,000,” he said. Web Giants In the speech, the government laid out plans to crack down on what he called tax avoidance by digital giants, vowing to ensure their revenue is shared with Canadian media and artists. “Web giants are taking Canadians’ money while imposing their own priorities,” the government said. “Things must change, and will change.” In terms of his climate goal of cutting emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, Trudeau said he plans to fast-track those targets and will legislate reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, partly through the Clean Power Fund and supporting investments in renewable energy. “We don’t want to see more words,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters after the speech. “Canadians want to see action. They’re worried, they’re afraid, they’re struggling. And they want to see some concrete action.” --With assistance from Shelly Hagan, Erik Hertzberg and Derek Decloet.

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. forecast in May that average prices would fall between 9 per cent and 18 per cent from pre-pandemic levels before beginning to recover in the first half of 2021. Chief Economist Bob Dugan reiterated that forecast, though he cautioned that it’s difficult to predict the “peaks and troughs” and there are many moving parts. “When I say I stand by our forecasts, it’s really with respect to what are the broad trends we expect moving forward,” Dugan said Monday on a conference call with reporters. “When I look at the housing market there are a tremendous number of risks.” Canada’s housing market has not only defied expectations of a slowdown, it’s booming, even as the economy suffers from the deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Demand for homes combined with tight inventory levels and historically low interest rates are driving gains. In its latest housing market outlook, released in May, the agency predicted an average price of $460,292 (US$345,900) in the first quarter 2021, based on the midpoint of a high and low range. The average price for August, reported last week by the Canadian Real Estate Association, was $586,000. That means if CMHC’s forecast is correct, prices would plunge 21 per cent between now and the end of March next year. Unsustainable Demand While Dugan wouldn’t confirm the scale of price declines, he did say the direction was correct. He also said he wasn’t convinced recent demand is sustainable. “I’m not convinced that we have a sustainable basis for housing demand in the economic disturbance that’s going on related to COVID-19,” he said. “That’s why I say I stand by the forecasts.” Pent-up demand has been formidable, driving the country’s housing market to new heights. Nationally, sales jumped 6.2 per cent in August, the fourth straight month of strong gains after the market froze at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, CREA said last week. Sales are now 33.5 per cent above year-earlier levels. Benchmark prices rose 1.7 per cent in August and are now 9.4 per cent higher than in August 2019. But Dugan doesn’t see it lasting, at least until a vaccine arrives. “Now if I’m wrong on the timing of trough, that could happen, but I certainly believe in the overall trend that there’s scope for price declines, for weaker demand and after that resolves itself eventually a recovery once we have a vaccine in place,” he said. --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Politics Sep 16, 2020 Latest immigration numbers highlight risk to Canada's recovery Shelly Hagan, Bloomberg News Immigration drop leads to concerns about economic recovery VIDEO SIGN OUT Canada’s immigration slump deepened in July, reflecting the impact of closed borders and highlighting a potential downside risk to the economy. The latest government data show Canada admitted 13,645 permanent residents in July, down 63 per cent from the same period last year as COVID-19 travel restrictions continue. July’s figures are in line with the nearly two-thirds drop between April and June, pouring cold water on hopes for a quick rebound. Immigration had been one of the main catalysts of Canada’s economic growth before the pandemic, a driver that looks increasingly under threat. Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino unveiled targets in March for 341,000 permanent residents this year, but through the first seven months only 34 per cent of that number had been granted entry. “It’s really depressed compared to last year and it seems unlikely to change anytime soon,” Andrew Agopsowicz, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said by phone, adding the July decline is “worrisome”. Agopsowicz predicts the country will meet 70 per cent of its 2020 targets, which would equate to 238,700 newcomers. Lower immigration could strain urban housing markets and result in reduced funding for post-secondary institutions, RBC said in a report last month. It could also hamper innovation. Study permits are showing a similar trend. In July, Canada issued 13,455 new study permits, down 59 per cent from 32,540 in the same period last year. Agopsowicz expects immigration to remain weak through the winter, with visa-application centers closed in many countries and travel restrictions still in place. He recommends governments “double down” on programs that encourage foreigners already in Canada -- such as students and temporary foreign workers -- to stay put.

Alternative data from credit card transactions, restaurant bookings and job postings show the economy fell into a more uneven pace of growth in September after the initial strong summer rebound. With virus cases rising and provinces tightening restrictions, the path to a full recovery faces major obstacles. Here’s a look at last month’s numbers. Consumer transactions appear to have hit a plateau in August and September after a strong initial rebound starting in May, spending data from Scotiabank through Sept. 25 show. “Between April and mid-July, things were trending upward on a year over year basis and since then spending is kind of flat relative to last year,” Scotiabank Economist Nikita Perevalov said by phone. Credit and debit card data from Toronto-Dominion Bank show a similar flat-line trajectory. Spending picked back up in September after an August lull, but the rebound was mainly driven by home-improvement purchases. That reflects the boom in the housing market -- one of the few industries to remain resilient in the face of COVID-19. “If cases continue to pick up and hospitalizations follow suit, governments could impose even tighter restrictions, resulting in weaker spending activity in the coming weeks and months,” Sri Thanabalasingam, an economist at TD, said in a report. “This next phase of the recovery will be the hardest yet.” Canada has recovered almost two thirds of the 3 million jobs lost at the height of the pandemic. Recouping the rest won’t be easy, given the capacity restrictions and weak demand currently facing many businesses. The restaurant sector is also stalling, according to data from OpenTable. The number of seated diners at Canadian restaurants was about 33 per cent lower on average in September compared with a year earlier. That’s only a slight improvement from August. The industry faces further risks this month, after restaurants and bars in in Montreal and Quebec City were ordered to close for a month to help curb the spread of the virus. In Ontario, food and drink establishments have been ordered to shut by midnight.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Politics Sep 29, 2020 Even with 'slow burn' pandemic, deficit on track to hit $330B: PBO Jordan Press, The Canadian Press Pandemic measures 'are expected to cost less than' Ottawa anticipated: PBO VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} OTTAWA -- The COVID-19 pandemic will leave a lasting scar on the Canadian economy that could produce permanent deficits, the parliamentary budget officer says in a report estimating this year's shortfall at $328.5 billion. That figure reflects measures announced as of the start of the month, including an estimated $225.9 billion in emergency aid in response to the pandemic. It also reflects the budget office's prediction the government will recoup more in personal and corporate taxes than the Liberals estimated in a July update that pegged the deficit at $343.2 billion, as well as lower-than-anticipated spending on the federal wage subsidy program, which the Liberals have now vowed to extend until next summer. The scenario budget officer Yves Giroux outlined in his updated outlook suggested economic output won't return to pre-pandemic levels until early 2022 and will still be below where it would have been had the pandemic never happened. The national unemployment rate won't be at or below where it was in February until 2023 or 2024, Giroux said in his report released Tuesday. “The response to the pandemic and the current policies are sustainable … but it wouldn’t take much for the debt-to-GDP ratio to continue to increase over the next several years,” Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux told BNN Bloomberg in a television interview Tuesday after the report was released. Feds have foot on the fiscal pedal: Macquarie Group economist David Doyle, North American economist and Canadian market strategist at Macquarie Group, says yesterday's Throne Speech shows the Federal Government has its ""foot on the fiscal pedal"" in promising to do whatever it takes to get the economy back on track. But Doyle also warns that economic growth going forward will be more challenged, and the Federal budget deficit could mushroom to close to $400 billion. Much of the spending is expected to be temporary as the government tries to put a financial floor under households and businesses feeling economic pressure from the pandemic. Giroux said in his report that the budget deficit will fall to about $73.8 billion next year and continue to fall in ensuing fiscal years. But in a nod to how dramatically the government's fiscal position has changed, his report estimates deficits roughly $40 billion larger each year, on average, compared to the outlook the office provided pre-pandemic. Giroux told BNN Bloomberg the report assumes a “slow burn” scenario for the pandemic, meaning it doesn’t account for a spike in cases or further economic shutdowns. Giroux said it will be important for the federal government to outline its fiscal plan for the coming months and years in its fall budget or economic update. “I think it’s important for the government to lay out its longer-term plan for the economy,” he said. The debt this year is expected to push past $1 trillion, and continue to climb. As a percentage of the economy, which had been the Liberals' preferred fiscal anchor, the debt could peak at 48.3 per cent in 2023 before finally falling under the PBO's scenario. ""Every step of the way, we've had Canadians' backs, supporting the most vulnerable, ensuring our businesses can come back strong through this pandemic and ensuring every step of the way that we do so in a fiscally responsible way,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in question period in the House of Commons Tuesday. ""That's what Canadians expect of us, and that's what we'll keep doing."" Could tax hikes be considered to pay for Canada’s ballooning deficit? Bloomberg News' Kait Bolongaro discusses the big takeaways from the throne speech and how Ottawa plans to pay for the large deficit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal finances are sustainable, ""but barely,"" Giroux said, noting it wouldn't take much in terms of new spending or tax cuts for the situation to change. The report paints one possible spending picture, envisioning a world where pandemic-related restrictions stay in place for the next 12 to 18 months while a vaccine is developed and then widely distributed. The timing of a vaccine, an extension of pandemic-related aid, changes to interest rates, or the creation of new programs could throw off the PBO's scenario. For instance, should the government debt-finance some or all of the proposed measures in its recent throne speech, the medium-term outlook for federal finances could change. Overall, Giroux said things are likely to be worse than they are likely to be better in the scenario his office paints. The Liberals' throne speech vowed a fiscal update this fall, and to tax extreme wealth to pad depleted government coffers. ""No one knows what the Liberal government means when they say that,"" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said during question period. He called on the government to ensure ""those who have profited off the pandemic pay the price."" Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said the government needed a plan put more people to work, and have fewer on federal aid, by helping small- and medium-sized businesses. ""The only way to protect the finances of the government, to furnish the funds for our programs and put food on the table of our families is through jobs,"" he said. In a separate report Tuesday, Giroux's office estimated a commercial rent-relief program would cost the government $1.5 billion, or roughly half of what was budgeted, after it was extended through this month. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce called on the government to quickly tell companies what help might be coming as rent is due Thursday, while the Canadian Federation of Independent Business warned that only one-fifth of its members expected to stay open without rent relief. - with files from BNN Bloomberg Related Worldwide death toll from coronavirus eclipses 1 million The Trump Administration 8:29 What happens when the president is too sick to lead? 9:46 Trump's positive COVID results 'completely upsets the campaign': Former U.S. congressional budget director 8:57 Canada and U.S. shouldn't 'normalize' border closure: Canadian American Business Council CEO 6:16 Stocks diving on Trump COVID test and weak jobs report 5:25 Market risks rising, seek cash and gold: Market strategist 7:44 Best for Biden to show 'sympathy' right now despite tensions with Trump: Signum Global Advisors' chairman 9:45 'Biden doesn't have to do anything': Rosenberg on Trump's COVID test and the election 4:41 Trump testing positive for COVID-19 'could actually help' him: AGF's chief U.S. policy strategist Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2020 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

In the three months ending June, Canada’s population grew by just 25,384, or 0.1 per cent, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday. That marks the second smallest one-quarter population increase in data going back to World War II. A dramatic drop in international migration was the main factor. It’s a sharp reversal for a country that has relied on rapid population numbers to drive its economy in recent years, with immigrants fueling a robust increase in the labor force. A sharp drop in international migration could have implications for everything from the housing market to demand for services in urban centers. “It will be important going forward to ensure that the flow of immigration can recover over the next year to make up for this lost growth,” Andrew Agopsowicz, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said by email. Given the nation’s aging population, the country has been relying on higher immigration levels to grow its workforce. Canada’s immigration-led population boom was the fastest among Group of Seven countries last year. The slowdown in the second quarter weakened the country’s annual pace of population growth to 1.1 per cent -- the lowest in 4 years. The number of people living in Canada rose by 411,854 in the 12 months through June, to 38 million. That’s about 150,000 less than the annual increase recorded in June last year. In the second quarter, Canada recorded only 34,271 immigrants compared with 94,281 in the same period last year. That was the lowest number of newcomers received in the second quarter since 1986. The number of non-permanent residents, such as foreign workers and students, declined by 24,768 in second quarter. Statistics Canada also cited “excess mortality” associated with the pandemic for contributing to the population decline.

As cases across the country continue to climb, the fear of a second wave and an additional knock to the economy is all too real. In the recent throne speech, the federal government offered up some support by the way of extending its Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) program to assist businesses with covering fixed costs as part of a plan to create one million jobs. Jobs are key in my opinion. Sign up for BNN Bloomberg's new weekly newsletter, Home Economics, here: https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/subscribe Small businesses are struggling and we still have one million fewer people employed than we did prior to the pandemic. Add to this, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) as we know comes to an end on Sept. 26, at which time the following is expected to happen: 1. The government is expected to transition to a modified EI program on Sept. 27 2. The government has telegraphed that it’s launching three new temporary recovery benefits covering self-employed, sickness and caregivers who in the past may not have been covered by EI. 3. The EI eligibility requirement has been lowered to 120 insurable hours across Canada 4. The majority of CERB recipients will be automatically transitioned to EI. 5. Ottawa plans to increase the value of weekly benefits for unemployed workers to $500 a week These measures are temporary and will be only in place for a year. While the window may be closing, there is still time to get your financial house in order. The key to getting our economy back on track – in other words, moving from survival mode to a place where you’re thriving – is getting people back to work. This will require education and, in many cases, retraining. However, it’s tough to compete in today's competitive environment, so how do you stand out from the crowd? I reached out to Pino Addesa, recruitment director at The Staffing Alternative, on how to position yourself and your resume as you look for new opportunities. Here’s what he said: 1. Keep your resume short and simple. That means two pages maximum. Cut out the fat; less is more. 2. Proof read your resume before submitting it. Even if you have the right skills, some employers will automatically discount your profile if they find a spelling or grammar error on a resume. 3. A resume should always be in chronological order from the most recent work experience to past work experience. 4. Before applying for a job, ensure you have the requirements in terms of hard and soft skills, and ensure they are effectively communicated on your resume. 5. Provide and showcase metrics on your resume to help tell your story. In other words, what have you done to make a difference or a financial impact on the business. We need to focus on job creation and promotion of business investment. The recovery is clearly going to be uneven – and certain sectors are going to struggle and take much longer to recover than others. In the meantime, try to control what you can. Finding a job right now isn't about finding your dream job. It’s more about creating some financial flexibility in your life – and that means taking advantage of every opportunity to stand out from the crowd.

Alternative data from credit card transactions, restaurant bookings and job postings show the economy fell into a more uneven pace of growth in September after the initial strong summer rebound. With virus cases rising and provinces tightening restrictions, the path to a full recovery faces major obstacles. Here’s a look at last month’s numbers. Consumer transactions appear to have hit a plateau in August and September after a strong initial rebound starting in May, spending data from Scotiabank through Sept. 25 show. “Between April and mid-July, things were trending upward on a year over year basis and since then spending is kind of flat relative to last year,” Scotiabank Economist Nikita Perevalov said by phone. Credit and debit card data from Toronto-Dominion Bank show a similar flat-line trajectory. Spending picked back up in September after an August lull, but the rebound was mainly driven by home-improvement purchases. That reflects the boom in the housing market -- one of the few industries to remain resilient in the face of COVID-19. “If cases continue to pick up and hospitalizations follow suit, governments could impose even tighter restrictions, resulting in weaker spending activity in the coming weeks and months,” Sri Thanabalasingam, an economist at TD, said in a report. “This next phase of the recovery will be the hardest yet.” Canada has recovered almost two thirds of the 3 million jobs lost at the height of the pandemic. Recouping the rest won’t be easy, given the capacity restrictions and weak demand currently facing many businesses. The restaurant sector is also stalling, according to data from OpenTable. The number of seated diners at Canadian restaurants was about 33 per cent lower on average in September compared with a year earlier. That’s only a slight improvement from August. The industry faces further risks this month, after restaurants and bars in in Montreal and Quebec City were ordered to close for a month to help curb the spread of the virus. In Ontario, food and drink establishments have been ordered to shut by midnight. Additionally, as the weather gets colder and patios close, some diners may be reluctant to visit restaurants, given the risk of catching the virus is known to be higher indoors.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Canada News Wire Oct 21, 2020 Retail sales slow in Canada after strong run peters out Shelly Hagan, Bloomberg News Retail sales growth slows in August VIDEO SIGN OUT The recovery in Canadian retail sales is fizzling. Sales eked out a gain of 0.4 per cent in August, Statistics Canada said Wednesday in Ottawa. That fell short of the 1.1 per cent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Excluding vehicles, receipts rose 0.5 per cent, versus a forecast gain of 0.9 per cent. After cratering in April on mandatory lockdowns, retail sales increased for four consecutive months through August, recovering to pre-pandemic levels in all major categories except cars, gasoline and clothing. But the pace of growth has slowed dramatically since the early summer, and a preliminary estimate from the agency showed receipts were flat in September. The outlook for retail sales is fairly bleak, with the recent surge in Covid-19 infections forcing some Canadian provinces, including Quebec and Ontario, to tighten up on social distancing measures. Capacity restraints and further shutdowns in the face of a second wave will likely keep a lid on demand. Wednesday’s results “surprised to the downside,” and “came despite healthy income gains from the recovery in employment, and before the impact of the virus’s second wave, which is expected to add a chill to fall economic activity, Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report to investors. Core retail sales, which exclude gas and autos, rose 0.4 per cent in August, partly reversing a decline in the previous month, Statistics Canada said. The gain was driven by sales at building materials and grocery stores, and was partly offset by declines at furniture, electronics and sporting goods vendors. “Consumers continue to drive the recovery, with limited availability of services and travel at least partly redirected into goods spending,” Robert Kavcic, an economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to investors. “But, with a lot of pent-up demand and lifestyle-adjustment spending seemingly running its course, this momentum could be tougher to sustain in the quarters ahead.” It’s a similar story for inflation. Price pressures picked up in September but remained subdued as the economy emerges from the aftermath of the pandemic, Statistics Canada said in a separate report. Annual inflation accelerated to 0.5 per cent in the month, well below normal levels as companies keep prices in check -- giving the Bank of Canada license to keep interest rates at historic lows in order to stoke growth.

A coalition that includes the industry association Restaurants Canada and a number of food service businesses has issued an open letter to Premier Doug Ford, asking to see what data the province relied on in setting its health measures. The letter says no data have been provided so far that would suggest restaurants are a major point of transmission for the virus. It notes restaurants have had to make significant investments in safety procedures and training, personal protective equipment and other measures, yet those in some regions are nonetheless being forced to stop serving customers indoors. A document released yesterday by the province showed that in four COVID-19 hot spots -- where indoor dining is currently banned -- the proportion of outbreaks linked to restaurants and bars between Aug. 1 and Oct. 24 ranged between 3.2 and 27.14 per cent. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams, said the provincial health table recommended targeting any ""risk sites"" where transmission could potentially be higher.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics News Wire Oct 27, 2020 Bank of Canada to reinforce low-rate pledge in Wednesday decision Shelly Hagan, Bloomberg News Bank of Canada's view on economic recovery VIDEO SIGN OUT The Bank of Canada has made a long-term commitment to keep interest rates at historic lows, and will use its policy decision Wednesday to reinforce that guidance. That means holding its overnight interest rate at 0.25 per cent, reiterating it will likely keep it there for years and pledging to continue buying government bonds. The bank releases its rate setting and Monetary Policy Report at 10 a.m. in Ottawa. Governor Tiff Macklem will give a press conference at 11 a.m. The central bank’s extraordinary measures have helped Canada emerge more quickly than expected from the worst of the economic crisis. It’s unlikely Macklem will choose to make any significant changes to the playbook now, with risks rising as the country enters a second wave of COVID-19. “I don’t think there will be any change in policy at all, not for rates and no drastic changes to the pace of purchases,” Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said by phone, adding the central bank will probably raise its third-quarter growth forecast. “Of course with virus cases rising and businesses having to close again, that’s a downside risk,” she said. The Bank of Canada has committed to keeping its overnight rate at near zero until economic slack is absorbed and the 2 per cent inflation target is sustainably achieved -- something that could take years. It has also pledged to buy a minimum of CUS$5 billion (US$3.8 billion) a week in government bonds under its quantitative easing program. It’s an extremely accommodative stance to help pull Canada out of the deepest downturn since the Great Depression. But risks are beginning to appear. In particular, the bank’s asset purchase program is threatening to corner the country’s government bond market. The central bank already owns about a third of Canada’s federal government debt, and officials are under pressure to provide some details on how they could temper reliance on asset purchases without tightening policy. “The larger their share the more complicated their exit plan,” Frances Donald, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said by phone. The risk is that Canada could face a “2013-type taper tantrum,” Donald said, referring to a panic-induced spike in yields that occurred after the Federal Reserve suggested it would begin scaling back its bond purchases. Macklem may provide more clarity on his statement in September that bond purchases will be “calibrated” to provide the needed stimulus. One possibility is that policy makers could alter the focus of their bond buying to different parts of the curve, according to Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “There could be some scope for calibration there, but it would be technical rather than fundamental in nature,” Mendes said by phone. Economists expect the Bank of Canada to upwardly revise 2020 growth projections, which turned out to be overly pessimistic. But they don’t anticipate a rosy outlook. “Any enthusiasm is likely to be dampened by the second wave of COVID-19 infections that is now underway and new containment measures that will put additional pressure on what was already a slowing pace of recovery,” Josh Nye, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, said by email. While other central banks including the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia look set to provide some additional stimulus, there may be less pressure on the Bank of Canada to do more, Nye said, citing fiscal policy that “remains quite supportive.” “It’s also worth noting that the BoC has already been one of the more aggressive central banks in expanding its balance sheet since the start of the pandemic,” Nye said.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Canada News Wire Oct 21, 2020 Retail sales slow in Canada after strong run peters out Shelly Hagan, Bloomberg News Retail sales growth slows in August VIDEO SIGN OUT The recovery in Canadian retail sales is fizzling. Sales eked out a gain of 0.4 per cent in August, Statistics Canada said Wednesday in Ottawa. That fell short of the 1.1 per cent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Excluding vehicles, receipts rose 0.5 per cent, versus a forecast gain of 0.9 per cent. After cratering in April on mandatory lockdowns, retail sales increased for four consecutive months through August, recovering to pre-pandemic levels in all major categories except cars, gasoline and clothing. But the pace of growth has slowed dramatically since the early summer, and a preliminary estimate from the agency showed receipts were flat in September. The outlook for retail sales is fairly bleak, with the recent surge in Covid-19 infections forcing some Canadian provinces, including Quebec and Ontario, to tighten up on social distancing measures. Capacity restraints and further shutdowns in the face of a second wave will likely keep a lid on demand. Wednesday’s results “surprised to the downside,” and “came despite healthy income gains from the recovery in employment, and before the impact of the virus’s second wave, which is expected to add a chill to fall economic activity, Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report to investors. Core retail sales, which exclude gas and autos, rose 0.4 per cent in August, partly reversing a decline in the previous month, Statistics Canada said. The gain was driven by sales at building materials and grocery stores, and was partly offset by declines at furniture, electronics and sporting goods vendors. “Consumers continue to drive the recovery, with limited availability of services and travel at least partly redirected into goods spending,” Robert Kavcic, an economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to investors. “But, with a lot of pent-up demand and lifestyle-adjustment spending seemingly running its course, this momentum could be tougher to sustain in the quarters ahead.” It’s a similar story for inflation. Price pressures picked up in September but remained subdued as the economy emerges from the aftermath of the pandemic, Statistics Canada said in a separate report. Annual inflation accelerated to 0.5 per cent in the month, well below normal levels as companies keep prices in check -- giving the Bank of Canada license to keep interest rates at historic lows in order to stoke growth.

The U.K. and Canada are on the brink of signing a new trade agreement to replace the existing deal Britain has through European Union membership. The agreement would be a major boost to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his efforts to plot a new course for Britain as a global trading nation outside the EU. An announcement is expected within days, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition they not be identified. Without it, the U.K. and Canada would face tariffs on trade from Jan. 1, when the Brexit transition period ends and the U.K. will no longer be part of CETA, the EU-Canada trade agreement that came into force in 2017. Canada is the U.K.’s 12th-biggest trade partner, with total trade between the two countries worth about 17 billion pounds (US$23 billion) in 2019. “Trade talks are at an advanced stage and progressing well,” the U.K.’s Department for International Trade said in a statement. “The U.K. is committed to seeking to secure a continuity trade deal with Canada before the end of the transition period.” The Canada breakthrough would be a relief for the U.K. as it continues contentious talks with the EU, its largest trading partner, over their own future economic relationship. Those discussions could bear fruit as early as next week, but the negotiations could still collapse. The U.K. is Canada’s third-largest export market after the U.S. and China. In the first nine months of this year, Canada has exported C$14 billion ($10.7 billion) in merchandise exports to the U.K., while it imported C$6.9 billion. Last year, Canada was the U.K.’s 15th-largest export market. 'Easy One' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week said the two countries could wrap up negotiations on a new trade deal by Jan. 1. “I know that rolling over and demonstrating free trade deals is important for the U.K. government. Canada is a really easy one. We’re there for it. We’d like to do it, so I am very hopeful that it’s going to get done but that’s up to the U.K. government,” Trudeau said last week during an online event hosted by the Financial Times. The Canada deal would be the second major trade accord announced by Britain in less than a month, after it agreed to terms with Japan in late October. Meanwhile, trade negotiations are ongoing with countries including Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. The U.K. still needs to roll over 14 other EU agreements by Jan. 1 to avoid defaulting to World Trade Organization terms, including with nations such as Mexico, Turkey and Singapore -- agreements which cover about 60 billion pounds of trade with Britain.

News Wire Company News Nov 25, 2020 Canadian banks' return-to-office plans thwarted by virus surge Kevin Orland, Bloomberg News Signage is displayed outside the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in the financial district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on Friday, Feb. 14, 2020. Canadian stocks declined with global markets, as authorities struggled to keep the coronavirus from spreading more widely outside China. However, investors flocking to safe havens such as gold offset the sell-off in Canada's stock market. , Bloomberg A recent surge in COVID-19 cases is derailing Canadian banks’ plans to bring employees back to offices, with one lender even asking some workers who had already returned to go back home. Canada is now facing about 5,000 new COVID-19 cases a day, prompting provinces and cities including Toronto -- home to the country’s five biggest banks -- to implement new restrictions to limit the virus spread. Even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently returned to working from home in an attempt to set a national tone of caution. Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are extending work-from-home plans for some employees until at least April, while National Bank of Canada is prolonging such measures for corporate-office staff until the end of June. Toronto-Dominion Bank hasn’t set a firm date for a return, but said in a memo last week that most people working from home won’t come back “until at least the spring.” Royal Bank of Canada even encouraged employees who had gone back to offices to return to working at home as of Nov. 16, according to a memo from Chief Human Resources Officer Helena Gottschling. Canada’s second-largest lender by assets said it will continue pre-screening and requiring masks and distancing for those who can’t work remotely. “For those in critical roles that cannot be done from home and who are working on premises today, please continue to work on site,” Gottschling said in the Nov. 12 memo. “Our ongoing protocols will continue to protect employees’ health and safety in the workplace.” The bank hasn’t set a firm time for employees to return. Royal Bank also delayed plans to have employees retrieve personal items from work sites in and around Toronto until further notice. Bank of Nova Scotia also hasn’t set a specific time for office employees to return because of “uncertainty around how the COVID-19 pandemic will unfold in the coming months,” according to a spokesman. Canada’s third-biggest bank said workers will receive at least four weeks notice before being asked to return. Bank of Montreal doesn’t “foresee any broad-based changes for employees who are currently working from home any sooner than April 2021, unless a specific business need exists,” the company said in an emailed statement. The country’s fourth-largest lender previously said workers would remain out of the office until the end of this year. The bank will give employees 30 days notice before asking them to return. The decision by Montreal-based National Bank to extend work from home until June 30 was for “containing the spread of the virus and giving as much clarity as possible to parents up to the end of the school year,” spokesman Claude Breton said in an email. Most CIBC employees who are already working off-site will continue to do so until at least April, Sandy Sharman, the executive who oversees human resources, said Wednesday in a memo to staff. The bank originally advised employees they’d be working from home until at least the end of the year. CIBC, Canada’s fifth-largest lender, said it will give workers at least four-weeks’ notice before asking them back, Sharman said in the memo. The bank had planned to start relocating employees to its freshly built new headquarters at CIBC Square by the end of the year. “With the majority of our team members working from home seamlessly, we have the flexibility to align our decisions and timing around our long-term real estate plans, including CIBC Square, and the guidance we receive from local governments and public health authorities,” she said.

The U.K. and Canada are on the brink of signing a new trade agreement to replace the existing deal Britain has through European Union membership. The agreement would be a major boost to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his efforts to plot a new course for Britain as a global trading nation outside the EU. An announcement is expected within days, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition they not be identified. Without it, the U.K. and Canada would face tariffs on trade from Jan. 1, when the Brexit transition period ends and the U.K. will no longer be part of CETA, the EU-Canada trade agreement that came into force in 2017. Canada is the U.K.’s 12th-biggest trade partner, with total trade between the two countries worth about 17 billion pounds (US$23 billion) in 2019. “Trade talks are at an advanced stage and progressing well,” the U.K.’s Department for International Trade said in a statement. “The U.K. is committed to seeking to secure a continuity trade deal with Canada before the end of the transition period.” The Canada breakthrough would be a relief for the U.K. as it continues contentious talks with the EU, its largest trading partner, over their own future economic relationship. Those discussions could bear fruit as early as next week, but the negotiations could still collapse. The U.K. is Canada’s third-largest export market after the U.S. and China. In the first nine months of this year, Canada has exported C$14 billion ($10.7 billion) in merchandise exports to the U.K., while it imported C$6.9 billion. Last year, Canada was the U.K.’s 15th-largest export market. 'Easy One' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week said the two countries could wrap up negotiations on a new trade deal by Jan. 1. “I know that rolling over and demonstrating free trade deals is important for the U.K. government. Canada is a really easy one. We’re there for it. We’d like to do it, so I am very hopeful that it’s going to get done but that’s up to the U.K. government,” Trudeau said last week during an online event hosted by the Financial Times. The Canada deal would be the second major trade accord announced by Britain in less than a month, after it agreed to terms with Japan in late October. Meanwhile, trade negotiations are ongoing with countries including Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. The U.K. still needs to roll over 14 other EU agreements by Jan. 1 to avoid defaulting to World Trade Organization terms, including with nations such as Mexico, Turkey and Singapore -- agreements which cover about 60 billion pounds of trade with Britain.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics News Wire Dec 8, 2020 Bank of Canada to restate low-rate guidance in Wednesday call Shelly Hagan, Bloomberg News Tiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada, speaks during a news conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on Wednesday, July 15, 2020. The Canadian Press/Bloomberg/Adrian Wyld The Bank of Canada is expected to keep extremely accommodative policy intact on Wednesday, with an outside chance it will do even more to support the recovery. Economists predict the central bank will restate a pledge to hold its overnight interest rate at 0.25 per cent until at least 2023, while continuing bond purchases at the current pace of $4 billion per week. The bank releases its December policy decision at 10 a.m. in Ottawa. Analysts say policy makers led by Governor Tiff Macklem could be tempted to make a case for additional steps to buffer the economy from recent developments that threaten the recovery: a strengthening currency, increased restrictions as COVID-19 cases rise, and a pick-up in market interest rates. The bank, however, is constrained by rates already near zero and limits to bond purchases. “There is very little to gain from talking hawkish, especially given where the Canadian dollar has traded,” Ian Pollick, head of fixed income, currency and commodity research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by email. “By the same token, any attempt to sound overly dovish runs the risk of being questioned given ongoing positive vaccine news, a decent data profile of late and restrictions of unconventional policy.” Wednesday’s decision is a statement-only affair, without a press conference from Macklem or a new set of forecasts. Deputy Governor Paul Beaudry will give a speech Thursday providing insight into the bank’s thinking. Micro Cuts Among policy options available to Macklem are talking down the currency, raising concerns about the immediate economic outlook and even lowering borrowing costs further. Speaking to lawmakers last month, Macklem said there’s potential to reduce the policy rate without going negative, raising the prospect of a cut of less than 25 basis points. “I suspect they would keep it in their back pocket for another meeting if need be,” Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone “But the fact that the governor even spoke about it means that sort of thing would at least be considered.” The Canadian dollar is hovering at its strongest level in more than two years, reflecting in large part broad U.S. dollar weakness. Bond yields have moved higher amid vaccine optimism as well as the likelihood of a fresh injection of fiscal stimulus. In a mini-budget last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government forecast a deficit of $381.6 billion this fiscal year, or 17.5 per cent of total output. It also said it could spend as much as $100 billion in additional stimulus over three years as needed. At the same time, however, new COVID-19 cases are spiking in Canada, forcing authorities in some areas to tighten restrictions, including a fresh lockdown in the financial capital of Toronto. Those moves are likely curtail growth in the fourth quarter and into 2021. “The vaccine is good news but there’s a whole lot of other virus worries right now,” Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by phone. Bank of Canada forecasts from October don’t show the economy fully absorbing slack before 2023, which will keep inflation below the 2 per cent target over that time. The guidance suggests that households, businesses and governments can expect cheap borrowing for several years to help cushion what’s expected to be a long slog to a full recovery. In addition to giving its low-for-long rate assurance, the bank said it would adjust the scale of its quantitative easing program to address concerns asset purchases were getting too large for the country’s outstanding bond market. While no changes to the program are expected Wednesday, some say the bank will need to pare back again soon to avoid problems. That complicates its decision making if the bank feels the need to continue providing stimulus. “They’re going to have to taper early in 2021 or they risk hitting that hypothetical line in the sand,” Pollick said. “We estimate they will probably have to taper as they get to the second quarter of 2021.” In his testimony before the House of Commons finance committee on Nov. 26, Macklem acknowledged market distortions could occur once the bank’s share of government bond holdings grows beyond 50 per cent. The bank currently holds about 34 per cent of the market, and if buying continues apace, Pollick estimates it will own 48 per cent by the end of 2021.

In his last speech of the year on Tuesday, Macklem said uncertainty remains elevated and new restrictions could trigger a small contraction at the start of 2021. On the plus side, “news on vaccines provides some reassurance that more normal activities can resume sometime later next year.” “The economic recovery from the pandemic is at a very difficult stage,” Macklem told the Vancouver Board of Trade via video conference. “Near term, rising COVID-19 infections will dampen growth and could even deepen our economic hole.” Speaking to reporters after his remarks, Macklem said data suggest only a marginal increase in output in the final months of 2020, followed by a modest negative or small positive in the first three months of next year. Overall, Macklem’s comments reflect a central bank that is in a holding pattern on policy, waiting for economic developments for cues on its next move. Canada’s currency rose to the highest in more than two years in the hour after Macklem’s speech before paring gains slightly during the press conference. It was trading 0.5 per cent higher at CUS$1.2704 against the U.S. dollar at 4:23 p.m. Toronto time. The yield on 10-year government bonds rose 1 basis point to 0.73 per cent. Balance of Risks In a speech last week, Deputy Governor Paul Beaudry emphasized how both downside and upside risks are “in play,” and said policy makers stand ready to move in either direction to respond. Macklem’s remarks Tuesday were focused on the need to strengthen exports, and less on the current economic outlook. He reiterated borrowing costs will remain low for long, and listed tools that would be available to the central bank should they need to take additional measures. Officials at the Bank of Canada have pledged not to raise their 0.25 per cent overnight interest rate until economic slack in the economy is fully absorbed. The governor, in his speech, laid down some markers of what he believes a sustainable recovery will look like. “So far, household spending has led the way. But for the economy to fully recover, it needs to be firing on more than one cylinder,” Macklem said. “To be sustainable, the recovery must broaden to include exports and, with this, business investment.” He also referenced the headwinds associated with recent gains in the Canadian dollar, which Macklem said reflected “broad-based” weakening of the U.S. dollar. “This is hurting the competitiveness of Canadian exporters in our largest market,” he said in the speech. The loonie’s recent rise has been “material” and is “on our radar screen,” he added during the press conference. Still, Macklem said he believes exports and business investment can rebound more quickly than they did after the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, especially if policy makers and corporate leaders step up. Moves could include removing inter-provincial trade barriers and ramping up infrastructure projects. He also said a well-educated and multinational workforce will help attract foreign investment and lead to increased exports. “Businesses have the leading role to play here,” Macklem said. “Investment in productivity-enhancing machinery and equipment is vital.” Related CIBC's Dodig says household debt levels not a concern Fed expected to offer new guidance, not action, on bond buying Bank of Canada sees fluid outlook, downside and upside at play COVID-19 Impact 9:34 Ford extending Toronto, Windsor lockdowns, details coming Monday France's Macron isolating after testing positive for COVID-19 Cancelled routes, pre-flight tests: COVID complicates holiday travel for sun seekers Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2020 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Melissa Leong, Special to BNN Bloomberg The future spending habits of Canadians post-pandemic VIDEO SIGN OUT The global pandemic changed everything in 2020. Now it is going to change everything forever. This is part of ""The Future of"" series, in which BNN Bloomberg looks at what is next for our transformed economy and daily lives. Jahmeelah Gamble is honest about how she has been plodding through the days of the pandemic. ""The app that I use to track my mental health is called Zara,"" she recently tweeted, referring to the clothing retailer. ""Based on the amount of orders I've placed in the last month, it's safe to say that I'm [sad emoji]."" The 33-year-old Mississauga, Ont.-based speaking coach admits that online purchases and strings of daily take-out are coping mechanisms, a temporary antidote to stress. Jahmeelah Gamble is a 33-year-old Mississauga, Ont.-based speaking coach (Handout photo) “I’ve reached a point where nothing feels good. You’ve got money but you can’t go out and spend it. You can’t celebrate. The only way to feel connected to the outside world is to buy something online,” she says. “With COVID, we’re not in control of things. We can’t do what we want to do; but we can buy what we want to buy. It makes me feel like things are still normal.” With the pandemic, our world seemed to change overnight and suddenly, the state of our finances became more salient, more pressing, and for many, perilous. Some of us have adopted behaviours when it comes to spending, saving, borrowing and investing that are unique to this time — ranging from helpful to harmful. But with officials touting light at the end of the tunnel, how will the pandemic have affected our money habits and financial values on the other side of it? Will the trauma of financial tumult change us forever? More importantly, how can we leverage the lessons for our own good? According to many surveys, Canadians have become more stressed about money (among a litany of other worries); a FP Canada report released this past summer, for instance, revealed that almost half of respondents have lost sleep over their finances. All of this anxiety changes your brain function and leads to irrational money decisions, explains David Lewis, chief client officer of BEworks, a behavioural economics consulting firm. RELATED: PERSONAL FINANCE Year-end tax tips to consider in the COVID era Pattie Lovett-Reid: Three smart money management moves to make before year-end Canadians show increased interest in high-interest car title loans amid recession It muddies our ability to process complex information, which is required when making financial decisions. It also causes us to focus on the now, rather than the future. This could take the form of retail therapy, as it may be in Gamble’s case and if I too, am honest, in my household’s case. This could also take the form of accumulating more debt without a plan to pay it back. As of Oct. 31, Canadian banks provided mortgage deferrals or skip-a-payment options to almost 800,000 Canadians and processed more than 478,000 credit card deferrals, although most of those programs have winded down. Canadian households owed an average of $1.71 for every dollar of disposable income in the third quarter, up from $1.58 in the previous quarter, according to Statistics Canada. “We’re engaging in these bad habits. We’re building up debt,” Lewis says. “But when the global pandemic is over, will you have your own financial pandemic?” DANGERS OF HOARDING While we may be awash in the same storm, we’re in different boats. Some Canadians are faring better than others. Despite being in a second wave of the pandemic, consumer spending was up slightly in November from last year. And with less to spend on, households have saved in excess of $150 billion more than normal times (the savings rate hit a record 27.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year), according to a Bank of Montreal report. A Bank of Nova Scotia poll revealed that 61 per cent of Canadians who are saving more are opting to build up an emergency fund. While saving for the unexpected and for other goals is prudent, hoarding cash is not. “The Depression generation to this day doesn’t want to throw things away because they remember the incredible scarcity during that time,” Lewis says. “Maybe this generation is going to see volatility in the market place and say, it’s too dangerous, maybe I’m going to avoid it.” People already tend to be shortsighted and risk averse when it comes to investments. “If you pull your money out of an investment account and stick it in a savings account, you’re not going to be beating inflation. If you avoid risk, you’re avoiding returns.” Behavioural experts say that recognizing that you may be thinking irrationally about money is half the battle. The next steps involve setting up a system to keep yourself in check. For example, Lewis says a colleague deliberately locked himself out of his online investment account to prevent himself from obsessively looking at it. Another strategy would be to consult your peers or a coach. During the market crisis in March, investors en masse contacted their advisors in panic. “I’ve literally had to walk people off the ledge,” says Jackie Porter, a certified financial planner with Carte Wealth Management Inc. “Intervention is crucial. Especially during this time, people need someone to talk through their fears, walk through their plans to help them see the horizon. It’s getting people to think of the future and that’s not tomorrow. It’s not five years from now. It’s not even 10 years from now.” ""The Depression generation to this day doesn’t want to throw things away because they remember the incredible scarcity during that time."" There is good scientific evidence that people are adaptive and five years from now, even 10 years from now, we may have adjusted back to our lives, barring any financial damage that has been done, some hypothesize. “I’m skeptical that a lot of the changes will stick and persist. I think people will be eager to get back to what they were doing before,” says Douglas Porter, BMO’s chief economist. And what were we doing before? “If we go back to the good old days of a year ago, the biggest concern in Canada was the state of household finances.The flow of savings was quite low. Household debt was relatively high.” We’ll have these concerns, yes, but we’ll also have hindsight. But it’ll take conscious effort to hold onto epiphanies and helpful money habits as we fall back into old and familiar routines. “The bigger question is what sort of values, priorities and behaviours will remain salient in people’s minds?” says Hal Hershfield, associate professor of marketing and behavioural decision-making at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. “A lot of people are surprised at what sort of things they’re valuing now and what sort of things they can do without.” Melissa Leong is the author of the award-winning finance guide Happy Go Money.

Magna will buy a 49 per cent stake in the new unit for 501.6 billion won (US$453 million) while the remainder will be owned by LG Electronics, the South Korean company said in an exchange filing. The joint venture will make e-motors, inverters and electric-drive systems in factories in Incheon in Korea and Nanjing in China, people familiar with the matter said earlier Wednesday. Shares in LG Electronics soared by the 30 per cent daily limit, their biggest gain on record. The company’s largest shareholder, LG Corp., advanced 10 per cent, the most since March. Automotive suppliers globally are increasingly positioning themselves to benefit from the growth in electric cars. A mix of stricter regulations on gasoline-powered cars, favourable government policies and improvements in battery technology has led more automakers to speed up electrification plans. The shift also has sparked a rally in shares of market leader Tesla Inc. as well as Chinese startups Nio Inc. and XPeng Inc. LG Electronics is “emerging as a new alternative to Tesla stock for investors,” said Jeon Kyung-Dae, chief investment officer for equities at Macquarie Investment Management Korea in Seoul. The company is “known as a leader in electronics parts and may produce electric cars based on an original equipment manufacturer model, rather than establishing its own EV brand.” The new company, tentatively called LG Magna e-Powertrain, will service orders from Magna as well as Magna’s clients. EV components being poured into the joint venture include LG Electronics’ battery heater unit as well as its power relay assembly division. Second Spinoff “The market for e-motors, inverters and electric-drive systems is expected to have significant growth between now and 2030, and the JV will target this fast-growing global market with a world-class portfolio,” the companies said in a joint media release. “LG will help accelerate Magna’s time to market and scale of manufacturing for electrification components, while software and systems integration are competencies that Magna brings to this venture.” The tie-up is LG Electronics’ second major investment in the auto industry after it bought automotive-lighting and headlight-systems provider ZKW Group GmbH in 2018 for about 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). Under the terms of that deal, LG Electronics acquired a 70 per cent stake in ZKW Group, with parent LG Corp. purchasing the remaining 30 per cent. Another LG group company, LG Chem Ltd., spun off its energy-storage and EV-battery business to form LG Energy Solution Co. on Dec. 1. The latest venture will also have a software R&D center in Troy, Michigan, where Magna’s U.S. headquarters is located, one of the people familiar with the matter said. LG Magna e-Powertrain will include more than 1,000 employees located at LG locations in the U.S., South Korea and China, and the transaction is expected to close in July, subject to a number of conditions including obtaining LG shareholder approval. Magna, along with other suppliers in the $1 trillion auto parts industry that are deeply enmeshed in advanced technologies, may be in a bind as large automakers in Europe and China transition to low-volume EV sales, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kevin Tynan and Andreas Krohn wrote in a note Dec. 7. But Magna’s electric-cars business can be a platform for growth, Tynan said. --With assistance from Heejin Kim.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Company News Commodities News Wire Dec 22, 2020 Magna in electric-car parts joint venture with LG Electronics Kyunghee Park, Gabrielle Coppola and Sohee Kim, Bloomberg News Magna forms joint venture with LG Electronics VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} Security Not Found The stock symbol {{StockChart.Ric}} does not exist See Full Stock Page » LG Electronics Inc. plans to spin off some its electric-car components business into a new joint venture with Canada’s Magna International Inc. Magna will buy a 49 per cent stake in the new unit for 501.6 billion won (US$453 million) while the remainder will be owned by LG Electronics, the South Korean company said in an exchange filing. The joint venture will make e-motors, inverters and electric-drive systems in factories in Incheon in Korea and Nanjing in China, people familiar with the matter said earlier Wednesday. Shares in LG Electronics soared by the 30 per cent daily limit, their biggest gain on record. The company’s largest shareholder, LG Corp., advanced 10 per cent, the most since March. Automotive suppliers globally are increasingly positioning themselves to benefit from the growth in electric cars. A mix of stricter regulations on gasoline-powered cars, favourable government policies and improvements in battery technology has led more automakers to speed up electrification plans. The shift also has sparked a rally in shares of market leader Tesla Inc. as well as Chinese startups Nio Inc. and XPeng Inc. LG Electronics is “emerging as a new alternative to Tesla stock for investors,” said Jeon Kyung-Dae, chief investment officer for equities at Macquarie Investment Management Korea in Seoul. The company is “known as a leader in electronics parts and may produce electric cars based on an original equipment manufacturer model, rather than establishing its own EV brand.” The new company, tentatively called LG Magna e-Powertrain, will service orders from Magna as well as Magna’s clients. EV components being poured into the joint venture include LG Electronics’ battery heater unit as well as its power relay assembly division. Second Spinoff “The market for e-motors, inverters and electric-drive systems is expected to have significant growth between now and 2030, and the JV will target this fast-growing global market with a world-class portfolio,” the companies said in a joint media release. “LG will help accelerate Magna’s time to market and scale of manufacturing for electrification components, while software and systems integration are competencies that Magna brings to this venture.” The tie-up is LG Electronics’ second major investment in the auto industry after it bought automotive-lighting and headlight-systems provider ZKW Group GmbH in 2018 for about 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). Under the terms of that deal, LG Electronics acquired a 70 per cent stake in ZKW Group, with parent LG Corp. purchasing the remaining 30 per cent. Another LG group company, LG Chem Ltd., spun off its energy-storage and EV-battery business to form LG Energy Solution Co. on Dec. 1. The latest venture will also have a software R&D center in Troy, Michigan, where Magna’s U.S. headquarters is located, one of the people familiar with the matter said. LG Magna e-Powertrain will include more than 1,000 employees located at LG locations in the U.S., South Korea and China, and the transaction is expected to close in July, subject to a number of conditions including obtaining LG shareholder approval. Magna, along with other suppliers in the $1 trillion auto parts industry that are deeply enmeshed in advanced technologies, may be in a bind as large automakers in Europe and China transition to low-volume EV sales, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kevin Tynan and Andreas Krohn wrote in a note Dec. 7. But Magna’s electric-cars business can be a platform for growth, Tynan said. --With assistance from Heejin Kim.

Tal said the broad-market weakness of the American dollar has pushed the loonie to dizzying heights, carrying with it potential headaches for the domestic export sector and economy. “I think that the Canadian dollar has no business being where it is now, and it’s all about the general weakness of the American dollar,” he said in a Thursday interview. “The fact that I’m worried is not so important, but the Bank of Canada is worried. Clearly they’re worried about it, they’re measuring it more and more. The question is: What do you do about it?” The Canadian dollar has been trading at just shy of 79 U.S. cents to start 2021, its highest level against the greenback since 2018. Howvever, Tal said he doesn’t think the Bank of Canada is out of ammunition when it comes to a further interest rate cut. His comments contrast those of the central bank’s governor Tiff Macklem, who has repeatedly declared the benchmark rate is at its effective lower bound. HAVE YOUR SAY Do you think the Bank of Canada should trim rates to contain the loonie? Results Total Results: 0 “One possibility, if they’re really desperate, is to actually cut interest rates again to, let’s say, 10 basis points,” he said. “Remember, policy rates in Canada are actually the highest among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development members, so we have room to cut. This is not our forecast, but it’s interesting to think about.” The Bank of Canada has essentially signalled that its key rate will remain on hold at 0.25 per cent through to 2023 in a bid to provide ample financial cushioning for the economic recovery. However, it has repeatedly highlighted the rate-fuelled household debt binge as a potential trouble spot for consumers. While those concerns persist, Tal said that with interest rates already at historic lows, a small cut would be unlikely to further inflame household balance sheets. “I’m not too concerned about debt levels at this point because, quite frankly, when you cut interest rates from an extremely low base, another 10, 15 basis points will not make a huge difference. Quite frankly, it would be more a currency story,” he said. Ultimately, Tal said he thinks the threat of a further rate cut could be more effective in tamping down the loonie than actually going ahead with one. “The issue is if the Bank of Canada moves, and nothing happens, and the loonie continues to go up; that’s when you realize that the Bank of Canada is unable to do anything,” he said. “Sometimes saying that you’re going to use this weapon is more effective than actually using it, and I think that’s more or less where we are now.” Related Why Canada's economic productivity could be better than expected post-COVID This is a very asymmetrical crisis: CIBC economist Benjamin Tal Level of market optimism due to vaccine rollout is worrisome: CIBC's Tal COVID-19 Impact 10:51 Feds weigh barring travellers from COVID-19 sick-leave benefit as cases mount Ontario hits record 3,328 new COVID-19 cases, 56 deaths 7:42 Pharmacies push to join COVID-19 vaccination effort as distribution ramps up Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Magna will buy a 49 per cent stake in the new unit for 501.6 billion won (US$453 million) while the remainder will be owned by LG Electronics, the South Korean company said in an exchange filing. The joint venture will make e-motors, inverters and electric-drive systems in factories in Incheon in Korea and Nanjing in China, people familiar with the matter said earlier Wednesday. Shares in LG Electronics soared by the 30 per cent daily limit, their biggest gain on record. The company’s largest shareholder, LG Corp., advanced 10 per cent, the most since March. Automotive suppliers globally are increasingly positioning themselves to benefit from the growth in electric cars. A mix of stricter regulations on gasoline-powered cars, favourable government policies and improvements in battery technology has led more automakers to speed up electrification plans. The shift also has sparked a rally in shares of market leader Tesla Inc. as well as Chinese startups Nio Inc. and XPeng Inc. LG Electronics is “emerging as a new alternative to Tesla stock for investors,” said Jeon Kyung-Dae, chief investment officer for equities at Macquarie Investment Management Korea in Seoul. The company is “known as a leader in electronics parts and may produce electric cars based on an original equipment manufacturer model, rather than establishing its own EV brand.” The new company, tentatively called LG Magna e-Powertrain, will service orders from Magna as well as Magna’s clients. EV components being poured into the joint venture include LG Electronics’ battery heater unit as well as its power relay assembly division. Second Spinoff “The market for e-motors, inverters and electric-drive systems is expected to have significant growth between now and 2030, and the JV will target this fast-growing global market with a world-class portfolio,” the companies said in a joint media release. “LG will help accelerate Magna’s time to market and scale of manufacturing for electrification components, while software and systems integration are competencies that Magna brings to this venture.” The tie-up is LG Electronics’ second major investment in the auto industry after it bought automotive-lighting and headlight-systems provider ZKW Group GmbH in 2018 for about 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). Under the terms of that deal, LG Electronics acquired a 70 per cent stake in ZKW Group, with parent LG Corp. purchasing the remaining 30 per cent. Another LG group company, LG Chem Ltd., spun off its energy-storage and EV-battery business to form LG Energy Solution Co. on Dec. 1. The latest venture will also have a software R&D center in Troy, Michigan, where Magna’s U.S. headquarters is located, one of the people familiar with the matter said. LG Magna e-Powertrain will include more than 1,000 employees located at LG locations in the U.S., South Korea and China, and the transaction is expected to close in July, subject to a number of conditions including obtaining LG shareholder approval. Magna, along with other suppliers in the $1 trillion auto parts industry that are deeply enmeshed in advanced technologies, may be in a bind as large automakers in Europe and China transition to low-volume EV sales, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kevin Tynan and Andreas Krohn wrote in a note Dec. 7. But Magna’s electric-cars business can be a platform for growth, Tynan said. --With assistance from Heejin Kim.

The report published Wednesday said “supercharged” demand driven in part by low rates, high household savings and improving consumer confidence will continue to push housing market activity in Canada to record highs. The increase is set to take place after a 2020 that was likely the strongest year ever for the market despite the COVID-19 pandemic stalling activity in the spring. In the report, RBC Senior Economist Robert Hogue estimated that home resale activity will reach 588,300 units in 2021, up from 552,300 units in 2020. The national benchmark price will rise 8.4 per cent to $669,000, driven mainly by low supply, Hogue wrote. But signs of a cooling down will also start to emerge at the end of the year, he said. “Call it a 2022 soft landing,” Hogue wrote, leaving open the possibility of a worse slowdown should the pandemic remain a threat to the Canadian economy despite large-scale vaccine distribution. RBC forecasted seasonally adjusted and annualized resales will be down from the December 2020 peak of almost 700,000 units to a “still solid” 515,000 units by the end of 2021. The report said low housing supply, the fading of COVID-induced market churn, an increase in interest rates and an erosion of affordability would be the main factors behind the Canadian housing market cooling down. The report also said the impact of low immigration levels resulting from the pandemic, which to date has only been felt in the rental and condo markets in Canada’s largest cities, could begin to spread out to the rest of the housing market by the end of the year.

A W-shaped recovery is when an economy begins to rebound from a recession quickly but then rapidly falls into another period of downturn before recovering again. ""That scenario is very severe and implausible in nature, but it's very important to understand,"" said CMHC's chief risk officer Nadine LeBlanc in a Thursday media briefing. Greater loss is coming from farming and construction industries: CMHC's chief risk officer Nadine Leblanc, chief risk officer at Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, breaks down the CMHC's 2020 stress testing results. The scenarios LeBlanc discussed are not meant to be predictions or forecasts tied to what CMHC sees headed for the country as it continues to grapple with COVID-19, but the agency runs the tests anyway to help with risk mitigation and offer transparency for Canadians. It began the tests at the onset of the pandemic, giving them a more realistic feel, but in past years has studied its ability to cope with sustained low oil prices, a global trade war, earthquakes, major volcanic eruptions and cyberattacks on financial institutions. Of all the scenarios CMHC looked at this year, the W-shaped recovery without government support is the most implausible, but likely to cause the severest impacts, LeBlanc said. She predicted CMHC's solvency and capitalization would likely be challenged in a W-shaped recovery where the government doesn't step in to offer relief. CMHC found that a W-shaped recovery with government support would curtail the severity, be more manageable and only cause a roughly 32 per cent drop in home prices and a 24 per cent unemployment rate. If the W-shaped recovery with government support was coupled with a severe cyberattack targeting the country's whole financial industry, CMHC stress test results show a 37 per cent decrease in home prices and a 24 per cent unemployment rate would be likely. In that scenario, cumulative insurance claim losses would reach $8.4 billion -- roughly half the amount CMHC said the country would see in a W-shaped recovery with no government assistance. CMHC also looked at a U-shaped recovery, where a recession gradually improves. In that scenario, they found house prices would fall by almost 34 per cent, the peak unemployment rate would be nearly 15 per cent and cumulative insurance claim losses would reach $9.6 billion. That scenario was the most plausible and would likely generate the most moderate impacts, LeBlanc said. Many economists have been predicting Canada will see a K-shaped recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It wasn't on CMHC's radar when it started looking at stress testing last March, but there is some interest in it, LeBlanc hinted. ""We're obviously not out of this crisis and so CMHC continues right now running stress testing and one that's looking very interesting to us is the K-shaped scenario.""

Commodities Economics Politics Canada Jan 20, 2021 Keystone XL is 'cooked': Former NAFTA advisor James Moore Stephanie Hughes, BNN Bloomberg Keystone XL project is 'cooked, it's done': James Moore VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} The controversial Keystone XL pipeline has been dealt a final blow with U.S. President Joe Biden’s confirmed plans to cancel its construction permits, according to one advisor. “I think Keystone XL is cooked, I think it's done,” James Moore, senior business advisor at Dentons and a former member of the NAFTA Advisory Council, said in an interview on Wednesday. However, Moore said Biden has a reputation as a ""bridge builder"" and that the U.S. will try to repair relations with Canada that had become strained under former president Donald Trump. “I think that his administration does owe Canada, a trusted ally, a lot,” Moore said. “I think we can get greater clarity on Enbridge Line 5. I think we should also get greater clarity on the Trans Mountain pipeline out to the West coast, which of course does dip into Washington state; depending on what precedent may be set by the KXL decision.” Line 5, a major pipeline project connecting Eastern Canada to Western Canada, has been threatened by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s demand that Enbridge Inc. shut the project down. Moore added that there is some potential for policy wins in other sectors that could soften the blow from Biden’s pipeline policies, especially lumber. “Locking in a good softwood lumber agreement now, that would have, I think, beneficial terms for market access for Canadian lumber into the United States while prices are high... That could be a real win for Canadian lumber producers.” That said, this day one decision may bruise relations between the two allies and may take some time to fix, according to Moore. “There is not any single policy that can be achieved by the stroke of a pen by Joe Biden that will offset the immediate hit and consequence that is the cancellation of Keystone.” Related Biden blocking Keystone threatens to end era of mega pipelines TC Energy halts spending on Keystone XL, says it's 'disappointed' with Biden move Biden to bar Keystone XL pipeline in reversal of early Trump move Pot Shots 2:49 CannTrust to enter pact to help settle class action lawsuit following illicit production scandal 8:53 Cannabis producers need to go global in the long-term: Aphria CEO 5:12 Aphria shares soar following better-than-expected Q2 results Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Commodities Jan 19, 2021 Trudeau vows to push U.S. on merits of Keystone XL The Canadian Press Trudeau says he will speak to highest-ranking U.S. officials to push Keystone XL forward VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} WASHINGTON -- Canada won't stop trying to convince U.S. president-elect Joe Biden of the merits of the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted Tuesday. But even Trudeau's full-throated defence of the controversial cross-border project, which Biden appears poised to cancel on Wednesday, betrayed a note of resignation. Asked pointedly what he planned to do to rescue the US$8-billion project, the prime minister lingered instead on what he'd done already, including his November phone call with the president-elect. He said it would be Kirsten Hillman, Canada's envoy in Washington, pressing Ottawa's case with what he described as the ""highest levels"" of the Biden team. And he acknowledged the elephant in the room: that Biden's campaign team promised back in May that it would do precisely what transition documents suggest will happen Wednesday. ""We understand, of course, that it is a commitment that ... the candidate Joe Biden made to cancel this pipeline,"" Trudeau said. ""At the same time, we continue to demonstrate the leadership that Canada has shown on fighting climate change and on ensuring energy security as a priority for North America."" Those documents, reviewed by The Canadian Press, suggest an executive order rescinding the presidential permit issued by Donald Trump is among the items on Biden's Day 1 to-do list. Environmental groups briefed on the incoming administration's plan also say they have been told it would come on Biden's first day in the White House. Advocates for the project, however, are clinging to hope that the ensuing outcry -- the Alberta government is already threatening legal action -- will prompt the Biden team to give them a chance to change the president-elect's mind. The politically fraught project, originally proposed in 2008, aims to deliver more than 800,000 additional barrels a day of diluted bitumen from the Alberta oilsands to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. It has long been a linchpin in Canada's strategy for boosting fossil-fuel exports by delivering Alberta's landlocked underground energy resources to tidewater. It has also become a lightning rod in both countries for the perennial debate over climate change, economic growth and society's long-standing dependence on fossil fuels. As a result, it never found favour among the Democrats in Barack Obama's White House, which included Biden as vice-president. That administration slow-walked the approval process for the better part of eight years, much to the frustration of then-prime minister Stephen Harper, until outright rejecting it in 2015. Canada's pitch to the Biden team has for months framed Keystone XL as a vastly different, more environmentally friendly project than the original. In a late bid to win favour with Biden, pipeline owner TC Energy Corp. confirmed Sunday an ambitious plan to spend US$1.7 billion on a solar, wind and battery-powered operating system for the pipeline to ensure it is zero-emission by 2030. Canada's approach to climate change more broadly has also evolved since then, Trudeau said. ""Canada has, in the intervening few years, become a global leader in the fight against climate change and moving forward in transforming our economy in important ways towards reducing emissions,"" Trudeau said. ""I trust that we will be heard, that our arguments will be considered.""

More Video Canada Company News Jan 15, 2021 Pfizer reducing Canada's vaccine deliveries on production issues The Canadian Press Pfizer reducing Canada's vaccine deliveries on production issues VIDEO SIGN OUT OTTAWA - Only half of Canada's promised COVID-19 vaccine doses by Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive in the next month, federal officials revealed Friday, blaming production issues in Belgium that will affect immediate vaccination plans. Procurement minister Anita Anand said Canada faces an “unfortunate” delay that is nonetheless expected to be made up by the end of March, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted most Canadians will still be vaccinated by the fall. News of the Pfizer delay drew immediate concern from Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe who said the province's strategy for the two-dose regime depends on steady shipments. “We have been planning our vaccine rollout based on this schedule, including second dosages,” said Moe, noting he expected 11,700 doses a week in February. HAVE YOUR SAY Are you concerned about Canada’s vaccine rollout? Results Total Results: 0 “If this has changed, they need to advise us immediately.” In British Columbia, where all available doses are being deployed as they arrive, Health Minister Adrian Dix said the delay will have “some significant effect” on when priority groups get their shot. “Obviously, when you receive fewer doses you immunize fewer people,” said Dix. The delay could also affect the wait time between each shot of the two-dose regime, he said. Although Pfizer-BioNTech suggests a second dose 21 days after the first, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said that could be extended to 35 days. A spokeswoman for Quebec Health Minister Christian Dube said the temporary slowdown reinforced the province's decision to wait up to 90 days to administer the vaccine's second dose. “The strategy remains the same: we must give a boost now and vaccinate as many vulnerable people and health workers as possible, as quickly as possible,” said Marjaurie Cote-Boileau. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the province was evaluating the impact of the delay and “will adjust as necessary.” Maj-Gen. Dany Fortin, who is leading the national vaccine distribution, said Pfizer's production delays would reduce deliveries by an average of 50 per cent over the coming weeks. He said that won't be felt until after next week because Canada's upcoming shipment has already been prepared. But the final week of January will bring “about a quarter of what we expected.” “The numbers will pick right back up after that to about half of what we had expected (and) progressively grow into the rest of February,” said Fortin. “Pfizer is telling us it will impact us for four weeks.” According to the government's website, more than 200,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were expected in each of the next two weeks and 1.4 million doses were expected in February. Trudeau said Ottawa was “working day in and day out to get vaccines delivered as quickly as possible” but acknowledged that Pfizer-BioNTech doses have been derailed in the short-term. Trudeau said this is why Canada has one of the most diverse vaccine portfolios in the world, pointing to seven bilateral agreements he says ensure “flexibility when it comes to supply chains.” “I want to be very clear: this does not impact our goal to have enough vaccines available by September for every Canadian who wants one,” Trudeau said from outside Rideau Cottage. Anand said all countries that receive vaccines from Pfizer's European facility have been affected but that Canada has been assured it will receive four million doses by the end of March. “This is unfortunate. However such delays and issues are to be expected when global supply chains are stretched well beyond their limits,” Anand said at a news conference. “It's not a stoppage.” Pfizer Canada spokeswoman Christina Antoniou said the production facility in Puurs, Belgium is undergoing modifications in the coming weeks to increase the number of doses it can pump out. Pfizer hopes to double its 2021 production to two billion doses. RELATED: COVID-19 IMPACT Canada's flawed vaccine plan sends snowbirds to U.S. Vaccines won't pull the economy out of COVID-19 until August: Michael Warner Norway warns of vaccination risks for sick patients over 80 “Pfizer Canada will continue to pursue its efforts in anticipation that by the end of March, we will be able to catch up to be on track for the total committed doses for Q1,” Antoniou said. The news came as Ottawa released federal projections that suggested the pandemic may soon exceed levels seen in the first wave, rising to 19,630 cumulative deaths and 10,000 daily infections in a little over a week. The modelling shows total cases could grow to nearly 796,630 from about 694,000, and that another 2,000 people could die by Jan. 24. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam urged sustained vigilance as a long-range forecast suggested rapid growth would continue without “quick, strong and sustained” measures. Tam said that's especially so in national hot spots of Quebec and Ontario, where a steady increase in hospitalizations has strained the health system's ability to keep up with critical care demands. The post-holiday projections do not take into account Quebec's recently implemented four-week curfew or Ontario's new stay-at-home orders. Tam emphasized the need to reduce community spread to help relieve some of the pressure on hospitals and long-term care homes. “The vaccine alone is not going to make a dent in some of that,” she said. Ontario reported 100 deaths linked to COVID-19, although that took into account a difference in database reporting between one of its health units and the province. The province's newly resolved tally added 46 deaths from Middlesex-London that occurred earlier in the pandemic. Ontario also reported 2,998 new cases of COVID-19 with 800 of those new cases in Toronto, 618 in Peel Region and 250 in York Region. Quebec reported 1,918 new COVID-19 cases and 62 more deaths, including nine that occurred in the past 24 hours. Concern also remained in Atlantic Canada's hot spot of New Brunswick, which reported 25 new cases and remains at the province's second-highest pandemic alert level.

The report published Wednesday said “supercharged” demand driven in part by low rates, high household savings and improving consumer confidence will continue to push housing market activity in Canada to record highs. The increase is set to take place after a 2020 that was likely the strongest year ever for the market despite the COVID-19 pandemic stalling activity in the spring. In the report, RBC Senior Economist Robert Hogue estimated that home resale activity will reach 588,300 units in 2021, up from 552,300 units in 2020. The national benchmark price will rise 8.4 per cent to $669,000, driven mainly by low supply, Hogue wrote. But signs of a cooling down will also start to emerge at the end of the year, he said. “Call it a 2022 soft landing,” Hogue wrote, leaving open the possibility of a worse slowdown should the pandemic remain a threat to the Canadian economy despite large-scale vaccine distribution. RBC forecasted seasonally adjusted and annualized resales will be down from the December 2020 peak of almost 700,000 units to a “still solid” 515,000 units by the end of 2021. The report said low housing supply, the fading of COVID-induced market churn, an increase in interest rates and an erosion of affordability would be the main factors behind the Canadian housing market cooling down. The report also said the impact of low immigration levels resulting from the pandemic, which to date has only been felt in the rental and condo markets in Canada’s largest cities, could begin to spread out to the rest of the housing market by the end of the year.

However, one prominent economist is concerned that workers expecting the trend to last may be “overdoing it.” Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at CIBC World Markets Inc., said some risks await Canadians when remote work is no longer an option post-pandemic. “I believe that this trend is unsustainable,” Tal said in an interview. ""It will probably continue over the next few months … but let’s picture our lives a year from now, 10 years from now. A huge amount of labour will go back to the office. A lot of that would be in big cities and all of a sudden you find yourself that you have to commute maybe two or three times a week.” How employers are embracing flexible work arrangements Jaqui Parchment, CEO of Mercer Canada discusses the future of work during the pandemic as it relates to flexible work arrangements. Tal said an end to the remote-work trend is “not a good thing, economically speaking.” He said workers will have less flexibility and longer commute times should their office life return to pre-pandemic norms. He also said it is also unclear how many employers will continue the work-from-home trend once the pandemic subsides. “Another factor is that, yes, your current job allows you to work full-time from home,” Tal said. “What about your next job?” Tal added that Canadians who bought a house in remote areas outside of major cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver could find that they may also need to invest in living arrangements in the city that would provide them with a base much closer to work. The shift could also challenge the suburban real estate market, Tal said. The pandemic created an optimal situation where many Canadians could purchase a home in a remote area at a lower price range. He warned that price acceleration in these areas would become a risk. “The question is: To what extent are prices in those remote places rising way too fast?” Related The future of cities: The end of the rat race will reshape Canada's urban centres The future of work: How the pandemic's 'awakening' will shape Canada's labour force 22% of Canadian companies will adjust pay if staff relocate: survey The end of hugs: How COVID-19 has changed daily life a year after Canada's first case COVID-19 Impact 7:00 J&J single-dose vaccine prevents 66% of moderate-to-severe cases EU poised to ban vaccine exports as shortage crisis mounts Novartis seeks partners to make more COVID-19 vaccines, therapies Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Real Estate Economics Canada Jan 21, 2021 W-shaped recovery would be 'very severe' without feds' help: CMHC Tara Deschamps, The Canadian Press W-shaped recovery could have 'severe' impact on housing: CMHC VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} A W-shaped recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic could trigger a nearly 50 per cent drop in housing prices and a peak unemployment rate of 25 per cent, if the government doesn't offer relief, says the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. A W-shaped recovery is when an economy begins to rebound from a recession quickly but then rapidly falls into another period of downturn before recovering again. ""That scenario is very severe and implausible in nature, but it's very important to understand,"" said CMHC's chief risk officer Nadine LeBlanc in a Thursday media briefing. Greater loss is coming from farming and construction industries: CMHC's chief risk officer Nadine Leblanc, chief risk officer at Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, breaks down the CMHC's 2020 stress testing results. The scenarios LeBlanc discussed are not meant to be predictions or forecasts tied to what CMHC sees headed for the country as it continues to grapple with COVID-19, but the agency runs the tests anyway to help with risk mitigation and offer transparency for Canadians. It began the tests at the onset of the pandemic, giving them a more realistic feel, but in past years has studied its ability to cope with sustained low oil prices, a global trade war, earthquakes, major volcanic eruptions and cyberattacks on financial institutions. Of all the scenarios CMHC looked at this year, the W-shaped recovery without government support is the most implausible, but likely to cause the severest impacts, LeBlanc said. She predicted CMHC's solvency and capitalization would likely be challenged in a W-shaped recovery where the government doesn't step in to offer relief. CMHC found that a W-shaped recovery with government support would curtail the severity, be more manageable and only cause a roughly 32 per cent drop in home prices and a 24 per cent unemployment rate. If the W-shaped recovery with government support was coupled with a severe cyberattack targeting the country's whole financial industry, CMHC stress test results show a 37 per cent decrease in home prices and a 24 per cent unemployment rate would be likely. In that scenario, cumulative insurance claim losses would reach $8.4 billion -- roughly half the amount CMHC said the country would see in a W-shaped recovery with no government assistance. CMHC also looked at a U-shaped recovery, where a recession gradually improves. In that scenario, they found house prices would fall by almost 34 per cent, the peak unemployment rate would be nearly 15 per cent and cumulative insurance claim losses would reach $9.6 billion. That scenario was the most plausible and would likely generate the most moderate impacts, LeBlanc said. Many economists have been predicting Canada will see a K-shaped recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It wasn't on CMHC's radar when it started looking at stress testing last March, but there is some interest in it, LeBlanc hinted. ""We're obviously not out of this crisis and so CMHC continues right now running stress testing and one that's looking very interesting to us is the K-shaped scenario.""

Commodities Economics Politics Canada Jan 20, 2021 Keystone XL is 'cooked': Former NAFTA advisor James Moore Stephanie Hughes, BNN Bloomberg Keystone XL project is 'cooked, it's done': James Moore VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} The controversial Keystone XL pipeline has been dealt a final blow with U.S. President Joe Biden’s confirmed plans to cancel its construction permits, according to one advisor. “I think Keystone XL is cooked, I think it's done,” James Moore, senior business advisor at Dentons and a former member of the NAFTA Advisory Council, said in an interview on Wednesday. However, Moore said Biden has a reputation as a ""bridge builder"" and that the U.S. will try to repair relations with Canada that had become strained under former president Donald Trump. “I think that his administration does owe Canada, a trusted ally, a lot,” Moore said. “I think we can get greater clarity on Enbridge Line 5. I think we should also get greater clarity on the Trans Mountain pipeline out to the West coast, which of course does dip into Washington state; depending on what precedent may be set by the KXL decision.” Line 5, a major pipeline project connecting Eastern Canada to Western Canada, has been threatened by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s demand that Enbridge Inc. shut the project down. Moore added that there is some potential for policy wins in other sectors that could soften the blow from Biden’s pipeline policies, especially lumber. “Locking in a good softwood lumber agreement now, that would have, I think, beneficial terms for market access for Canadian lumber into the United States while prices are high... That could be a real win for Canadian lumber producers.” That said, this day one decision may bruise relations between the two allies and may take some time to fix, according to Moore. “There is not any single policy that can be achieved by the stroke of a pen by Joe Biden that will offset the immediate hit and consequence that is the cancellation of Keystone.” Related Biden blocking Keystone threatens to end era of mega pipelines TC Energy halts spending on Keystone XL, says it's 'disappointed' with Biden move Biden to bar Keystone XL pipeline in reversal of early Trump move Pot Shots 2:49 CannTrust to enter pact to help settle class action lawsuit following illicit production scandal 8:53 Cannabis producers need to go global in the long-term: Aphria CEO 5:12 Aphria shares soar following better-than-expected Q2 results Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Commodities Jan 19, 2021 Trudeau vows to push U.S. on merits of Keystone XL The Canadian Press Trudeau says he will speak to highest-ranking U.S. officials to push Keystone XL forward VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} WASHINGTON -- Canada won't stop trying to convince U.S. president-elect Joe Biden of the merits of the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted Tuesday. But even Trudeau's full-throated defence of the controversial cross-border project, which Biden appears poised to cancel on Wednesday, betrayed a note of resignation. Asked pointedly what he planned to do to rescue the US$8-billion project, the prime minister lingered instead on what he'd done already, including his November phone call with the president-elect. He said it would be Kirsten Hillman, Canada's envoy in Washington, pressing Ottawa's case with what he described as the ""highest levels"" of the Biden team. And he acknowledged the elephant in the room: that Biden's campaign team promised back in May that it would do precisely what transition documents suggest will happen Wednesday. ""We understand, of course, that it is a commitment that ... the candidate Joe Biden made to cancel this pipeline,"" Trudeau said. ""At the same time, we continue to demonstrate the leadership that Canada has shown on fighting climate change and on ensuring energy security as a priority for North America."" Those documents, reviewed by The Canadian Press, suggest an executive order rescinding the presidential permit issued by Donald Trump is among the items on Biden's Day 1 to-do list. Environmental groups briefed on the incoming administration's plan also say they have been told it would come on Biden's first day in the White House. Advocates for the project, however, are clinging to hope that the ensuing outcry -- the Alberta government is already threatening legal action -- will prompt the Biden team to give them a chance to change the president-elect's mind. The politically fraught project, originally proposed in 2008, aims to deliver more than 800,000 additional barrels a day of diluted bitumen from the Alberta oilsands to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. It has long been a linchpin in Canada's strategy for boosting fossil-fuel exports by delivering Alberta's landlocked underground energy resources to tidewater. It has also become a lightning rod in both countries for the perennial debate over climate change, economic growth and society's long-standing dependence on fossil fuels. As a result, it never found favour among the Democrats in Barack Obama's White House, which included Biden as vice-president. That administration slow-walked the approval process for the better part of eight years, much to the frustration of then-prime minister Stephen Harper, until outright rejecting it in 2015. Canada's pitch to the Biden team has for months framed Keystone XL as a vastly different, more environmentally friendly project than the original. In a late bid to win favour with Biden, pipeline owner TC Energy Corp. confirmed Sunday an ambitious plan to spend US$1.7 billion on a solar, wind and battery-powered operating system for the pipeline to ensure it is zero-emission by 2030. Canada's approach to climate change more broadly has also evolved since then, Trudeau said. ""Canada has, in the intervening few years, become a global leader in the fight against climate change and moving forward in transforming our economy in important ways towards reducing emissions,"" Trudeau said. ""I trust that we will be heard, that our arguments will be considered.""

But the agreement won't ease pressure on the government to get vaccines into Canada because it won't start delivering until late next fall. Novavax applied Friday for regulatory approval for its vaccine candidate in Canada but is still finishing its clinical trials and doesn't expect to have the final data available for a month at least. The NRC facility is going up at lightning speed, said Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, but it won't be finished until late summer. And then it will take a month or two, said Champagne, for the facility to be certified. “At the end of the year we will be a position to be producing vaccine,” said Champagne. The new facility in Montreal was announced last August, and Champagne's department has been in talks with most of the leading vaccine makers trying to lure them into making their vaccine there when it is finished. None of those talks bore fruit until now. Currently Canada relies on Europe for its COVID-19 vaccine supply, a situation that's becoming treacherous because the European Union has new export controls on COVID-19 vaccines to try to protect its own deliveries. Trudeau said the oral promises he received from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that Canada's deliveries won't be stopped by the new controls, “were enough” to reassure him. This week's shipments of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are both starting to arrive in provincial receiving locations already, said Procurement Minister Anita Anand. Canada's shipments have been delayed or reduced by production slowdowns, but Trudeau said the promised four million doses from Pfizer and two million from Moderna are still expected to arrive by the end of March, and 40 million from each by the fall. If Canada's deliveries aren't interrupted, Canada's plan is to have most Canadians vaccinated by the end of September, before the new Canadian production of Novavax's product even starts. Trudeau said Canada has to look beyond the current vaccine plan. “We don't know what the future looks like for a year from now, two years from now, three years from now,” he said. “What we're very clear on is Canada will be developing domestic manufacturing.” Both NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole said the Novavax deal is welcome but too late. “This is something that should have been secured a long time ago,” said Singh. “It would have addressed a lot of the insecurity people are feeling about not getting the vaccine and seem delays in the rollout, because of production delays.” O“Toole said the fact the deal won't help Canada for months underscores the glacial pace the Trudeau government has set in expanding Canada's domestic biomanufacturing industry. “We need vaccines to turn the corner on COVID-19,” he said. O'Toole said Canada should have learned the lessons last spring, when not having places to make face masks and respirators and surgical gowns left Canada to compete in a wild global marketplace to get them. Now we're in the same position with vaccines, he said. Canada used to have a strong domestic vaccine industry. Federal records show in 1973, Canada relied on imports for only about one-fifth of its domestic pharmaceutical requirements including both vaccines and therapeutic drugs. But the industry began to dry up in the 1980s, with multiple firms closing their Canadian operations, including AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers and Johnson and Johnson. Today, Canada relies on imports for at least 85 per cent of the vaccines and other pharmaceuticals it uses. Novavax would be the first COVID-19 vaccine to be made in Canada. Medicago, the only potential Canadian supplier of the seven COVID-19 vaccines the federal government has pre-purchased, is building a new facility in Quebec to eventually make vaccines but if its COVID-19 vaccine safely finishes clinical trials and is approved, the initial doses will be made in North Carolina. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline are partnering on a vaccine though it is delayed until at least the fall because of disappointing early results. GSK, which is supplying the adjuvant for the vaccine - an additive to increase its effects - may fill vials with the adjuvant in Canada but the vaccine itself will be produced by Sanofi elsewhere. Trudeau announced two other new facilities will be capable of producing COVID-19 vaccines, but neither will be ready to do so this year. The Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan will be able to produce 40 million doses annually but won't be finished until the end of 2021. A new facility at Precision NanoSystems in Vancouver will be the first in Canada capable of producing mRNA vaccines, the technology involved in both vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. But that facility won't be ready until 2023, said Champagne. Canada has a contract to buy 52 million doses from Novavax. Last week the company said a Phase 3 trial - typically the last before a product is approved for wide use - in the United Kingdom showed the vaccine to be 89 per cent effective against COVID-19, including the new variant known as B.1.17 that was first identified there. A smaller Phase 2 trial in South Africa showed the vaccine was also effective against a variant that first emerged there, known as B.1.351. If it is approved by Health Canada, some doses will still have to be imported, because the new facility in Montreal is equipped to make only about two million doses a month.

Financial Accountability Officer Peter Weltman said a series of factors, including the pandemic and aging demographics, will contribute to the deficit, which will he projects will grow to $35.5 billion in 2020-2021. That figure is forecast to drop to $16 billion by 2024-2025 and remain at that level moving forward, barring any government policy change, he said. “The key takeaway here is that we're going to be pretty much stuck at a $16 billion ongoing deficit once we get through the pandemic,” Weltman said. “That's what our forecast shows unless there are significant spending or revenue changes going forward.” The FAO report focuses on Ontario's financial information up to Feb. 5 and doesn't take into account the province's latest fiscal projections released Wednesday. In those projections, the government predicted it will finish the 2020-2021 fiscal year with a record $38.5 billion deficit -- an amount larger than what the FAO projected due to the allocation of an additional $3 billion in spending. Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy's office could not immediately provide comment on Thursday's report from Weltman, but the minister had acknowledged a day earlier that the province's deficits were not sustainable in the long run. By law, when Ontario is in deficit, it must develop a recovery plan that charts a path to balanced budgets. The province is expected to deliver its 2021-2022 budget by March 31. The FAO report projects Ontario's economy will take a major hit because of the pandemic, noting that gross domestic product dropped a record of nearly six per cent in 2020. However, Weltman projects that Ontario will rebound strongly over the next two fiscal years, with GDP growth of 3.9 per cent in 2021 and 4.5 per cent in 2022. Outside of pandemic funding projected over the next two fiscal years, Weltman said planned program spending on both health care and education will not keep pace with demand for those public services. He also noted that the province has set aside larger than usual contingency funds in the next two fiscal years, with the 2020 budget allocating $3 billion to its standard contingency fund. In Ontario's 2019 budget, the government set aside a $1.1 billion contingency fund. “The government has yet to clearly indicate the specific purpose of the sharp increase in these funds after the pandemic,” the report notes. “Any unused contingency funds would be applied to reduce projected deficits.” Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said the report continues to show Premier Doug Ford's government is “sitting on” money in contingencies it should be using to fight the pandemic. “Premier, I call on you to protect Ontarians and implement provincially paid sick days, increase direct funding for small businesses, and deploy rapid tests to make our schools and workplaces safe,” he said in a statement. Liberal finance critic Mitzie Hunter said the report shows the government is “hoarding” money with the intention to use excess funds to reduce the deficit and balance the budget. “At a time when we are facing new variants and the viruses threaten schools and continue to ravage long-term care, this is the wrong direction” she said in a statement.

In a television interview, Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research & Associates Inc., said that while cryptocurrencies are here to stay, there’s no rational explanation for the massive run-up in the price of Bitcoin. “Crypto is here to stay. It has a function in the capital markets. But valuing it is next to impossible,” he said. “So all you really have to do is look at the price, and look at the chart, and you can see it’s a massive price bubble. The chart itself is telling you that.” Bitcoin prices briefly eclipsed the US$48,000-per-coin mark on Tuesday, marking a new record high. The most recent run was buoyed by Tesla’s disclosure it had bought US$1.5-billion worth of the cryptocurrency and had plans to begin accepting it as payment for its electric vehicles. BNN BLOOMBERG POLL: Do you agree with the Bank of Canada that there’s a “speculative mania” in cryptocurrencies? — BNN Bloomberg (@BNNBloomberg) February 10, 2021 While the cryptocurrency has found itself a high-profile fan in the form of Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, Rosenberg said a continued run higher is a matter of faith on the part of Bitcoin acolytes, not a matter of fundamentals. “In three words or less: Greater fool’s theory. You’re buying Bitcoin on the assumption that some bigger fool is going to buy it at a higher price,” he said. “The question you have to ask yourself is: ‘How do you value Bitcoin?’ It’s not a stock. You can’t do any cash-flow analysis.” Rosenberg’s criticisms come the same day Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane dismissed the recent boom in cryptocurrencies as a “speculative mania.” He argued the digital tokens don’t have the qualities necessary to become the currency of the future, given the volatile price moves. “The recent spike in their prices looks less like a trend and more like a speculative mania -- an atmosphere in which one high-profile tweet is enough to trigger a sudden jump in price,” Lane said. While the central bank has been studying the circumstances that could lead it to launching a digital loonie, should the need present itself, Lane said that such a scenario is by no means a certainty. “Our view remains unchanged: A digital currency is by no means a foregone conclusion.” Related Crypto boom is 'speculative mania': Bank of Canada's Lane Bitcoin craze fuels foreign crypto trading app downloads in Canada Bitcoin's Tesla-driven rally fizzles after prices hit US$48,000 Top Picks 46:12 Paul MacDonald's Top Picks: Feb. 11, 2021 45:57 David Driscoll's Top Picks: Feb. 10, 2021 46:14 Eric Nuttall's Top Picks: Feb. 9, 2021 Top Stories Economics News Wire 6:55 Canada's economy is seen lagging U.S. for fourth straight year Economists revised their growth estimates for Canada higher this year, though the recovery is expected to lag the U.S. Company News 4:32 Air Canada posts 'bleak' results as Transat deal comes through Air Canada says it lost $1.16 billion in the final three months of last year, releasing a financial report on the heels of last night's news that the Canadian government approved Air Canada's $190-million purchase of Transat A.T.

The Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy says there were 99,244 consumer bankruptcies and proposals along with business bankruptcies in 2020, down 30 per cent from the prior year. Total insolvencies plunged almost 40 per cent from the peak in 2009, with consumer insolvencies down 30 per cent from 2019 to an 18-year-low. Consumer filings decreased 33.5 per cent in the fourth quarter. All provinces registered lower consumer filings in 2020, with Prince Edward Island leading with a 43.1 per cent decrease while Manitoba had the smallest decrease at 19.7 per cent. Business insolvencies fell 24 per cent to reach their lowest level since tracking began in 1987. Arts, entertainment and recreation, as well as management of companies and enterprises had the largest increase in insolvencies, while construction and manufacturing had the largest declines. ""These historic low insolvency filings reflect the government aid programs that have kept many individuals and businesses afloat despite the significant financial distress caused by the pandemic,"" says Mark Rosen, chair of the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Politics Technology Feb 18, 2021 Liberal pledge to get GST from goods in Amazon warehouses could net $600M: PBO The Canadian Press New digital sales tax will increase costs for consumers: Michael Geist VIDEO SIGN OUT OTTAWA -- The parliamentary budget officer estimates the Trudeau Liberals' pledge to collect federal sales tax on some goods sitting in Amazon warehouses could net Ottawa just over $600 million. The extra tax revenue is spread over five years, starting this year and ramping up every year thereafter for a total of $604 million over that time. The proposal would try to close a loophole for unsold goods foreign-based sellers ship to Canada, then house until they are sold and shipped domestically to local buyers. GST is collected on the wholesale value of the goods when they come across the border but the federal sales tax isn't always collected by sellers when the goods are sold to consumers. That creates a gap the Liberals want to close by either making sellers registered to collect the GST do so on the final sale price, or making platforms like Amazon responsible for it instead. The Liberals are promising to have the policy come into effect on July 1. There are sources of uncertainty within the estimate crafted by budget officer Yves Giroux's officials, including how much of the shift to online shopping caused by COVID-19 will remain when the pandemic recedes. The report was one of two released by Giroux's office on Thursday as it continues to cost out promises the Liberals made in November's economic statement. The second report estimated that a crackdown on tax cheats could yield close to $800 million in new revenue over a five years. Collection is likely to start slow by the budget office's forecasts, beginning with just $1 million in tax revenue this year, and rising each year thereafter. By 2026, the budget office suggests federal coffers could collect $782 million from Canadians using offshore tax havens or aggressive plans to reduce the amounts they would otherwise have to pay. To get there, the government will have to spend $606 million over the same period to boost the audit capacity at the Canada Revenue Agency to focus on those most likely to use such schemes, including wealthy Canadians. The report warns it is difficult to predict with certainty how much more spending will lead to the collection of extra tax revenue. Giroux's experts also write it is difficult to predict how taxpayers will respond to the beefed-up audit capacity at CRA, noting some may declare more of their offshore holdings, while others may find new ways to evade taxes that are harder to detect in audits. The report also said the extra audits could lead to more appeals, delaying when taxes are collected. The government suspended its audit activities for part of last year because of the pandemic and the Tax Court of Canada did not sit. The PBO report made note of those issues, pointing to comments from the court's chief justice, in a webinar earlier this month, warning of a deluge of appeals likely to be filed later this year.

The Canadian Real Estate Association said Tuesday that January sales were up 35.2 per cent compared with a year earlier and up two per cent when compared to December. The increase came as the national sales-to-new listings ratio rose to 90.7 per cent -- the highest level on record. The previous monthly record was 81.5 per cent set 19 years ago. The actual national average price of a home sold also soared to a record $621,525 in January, up 22.8 per cent from the same month last year. CREA said market conditions were pushed to record levels in January because people have held off putting their homes up for sale in the middle of the pandemic, leaving fewer options for people to fight over. ""The buyers and sellers that will in time define the Canadian housing story of 2021 are mostly all still waiting in the wings,"" Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist, said in a statement. However, Cathcart believes the market is unlikely to see a rush of listings until the public heath situation improves and the dreary winter weather subsides. ""The best case scenario would be if we see a lot of sellers who were gun-shy to engage in the market last year making a move this year,"" he said. ""A big surge in supply is what so many markets really need this year to get people into the homes they want, and to keep prices from accelerating any more than they already are."" CREA found the Greater Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area, two of the country's most active and expensive markets, were heating up very quickly in January. The average seasonally adjusted price of a home in the GTA was $941,100 and in Vancouver, was just over $1 million. When the associated removed data from both those regions from the $621,525 national price average, it found the average price was slashed by $129,000. But that doesn't mean that conditions eased up outside the city centres, said Wins Lai, a Toronto real estate broker. Prices in areas like Vaughan and Markham, Ont., have reached levels she is shocked by. ""Outside of the city in somewhere like Barrie, we are seeing 40 offers on something that's $750,000 which is insane,"" she said. CREA said year-over-year price increases between 25 and 30 per cent were seen many regions in Ontario including Barrie, Niagara, Grey-Bruce Owen Sound, Huron Perth, Kawartha Lakes, London and St. Thomas, North Bay, Simcoe and Southern Georgian Bay. However, the largest year-over-year gains -- above 30 per cent -- were recorded in the Lakelands region of Ontario cottage country, Northumberland Hills, Quinte, Tillsonburg District and Woodstock-Ingersoll. Urban sprawl and the pandemic are responsible for part of this phenomenon, Lai said. ""People want to be outside of the city, they want to have their own homes and they don't want to be in elevators."" she said. While the downtown core may be less attractive because many people are working from home, young professionals and couples are still trying to snatch up homes there and bidding wars on condos are plentiful. CREA said January price gains were in the 10 to15 per cent range in the GTA, Mississauga, Chilliwack, B.C., B.C.'s Okanagan Valley, Winnipeg and on Vancouver Island. Montreal's average prices reached $434,200, 16.6 per cent compared to last January. They rose by as much as 10 per cent in Victoria, Greater Vancouver, Regina and Saskatoon and by about 2 per cent in Calgary and Edmonton.

That’s up from a previous yearly estimate of 4.4 per cent. Growth in 2022 is seen at 4.1 per cent, little changed from the January survey. The upward revision reflects what has been a more upbeat outlook in recent weeks. The global vaccine rollout, rising commodity prices that help Canada and potential impacts from more fiscal stimulus in the U.S. are driving the more optimistic predictions.

Financial Accountability Officer Peter Weltman said a series of factors, including the pandemic and aging demographics, will contribute to the deficit, which will he projects will grow to $35.5 billion in 2020-2021. That figure is forecast to drop to $16 billion by 2024-2025 and remain at that level moving forward, barring any government policy change, he said. “The key takeaway here is that we're going to be pretty much stuck at a $16 billion ongoing deficit once we get through the pandemic,” Weltman said. “That's what our forecast shows unless there are significant spending or revenue changes going forward.” The FAO report focuses on Ontario's financial information up to Feb. 5 and doesn't take into account the province's latest fiscal projections released Wednesday. In those projections, the government predicted it will finish the 2020-2021 fiscal year with a record $38.5 billion deficit -- an amount larger than what the FAO projected due to the allocation of an additional $3 billion in spending. Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy's office could not immediately provide comment on Thursday's report from Weltman, but the minister had acknowledged a day earlier that the province's deficits were not sustainable in the long run. By law, when Ontario is in deficit, it must develop a recovery plan that charts a path to balanced budgets. The province is expected to deliver its 2021-2022 budget by March 31. The FAO report projects Ontario's economy will take a major hit because of the pandemic, noting that gross domestic product dropped a record of nearly six per cent in 2020. However, Weltman projects that Ontario will rebound strongly over the next two fiscal years, with GDP growth of 3.9 per cent in 2021 and 4.5 per cent in 2022. Outside of pandemic funding projected over the next two fiscal years, Weltman said planned program spending on both health care and education will not keep pace with demand for those public services. He also noted that the province has set aside larger than usual contingency funds in the next two fiscal years, with the 2020 budget allocating $3 billion to its standard contingency fund. In Ontario's 2019 budget, the government set aside a $1.1 billion contingency fund. “The government has yet to clearly indicate the specific purpose of the sharp increase in these funds after the pandemic,” the report notes. “Any unused contingency funds would be applied to reduce projected deficits.” Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said the report continues to show Premier Doug Ford's government is “sitting on” money in contingencies it should be using to fight the pandemic. “Premier, I call on you to protect Ontarians and implement provincially paid sick days, increase direct funding for small businesses, and deploy rapid tests to make our schools and workplaces safe,” he said in a statement. Liberal finance critic Mitzie Hunter said the report shows the government is “hoarding” money with the intention to use excess funds to reduce the deficit and balance the budget. “At a time when we are facing new variants and the viruses threaten schools and continue to ravage long-term care, this is the wrong direction” she said in a statement.

The extra tax revenue is spread over five years, starting this year and ramping up every year thereafter for a total of $604 million over that time. The proposal would try to close a loophole for unsold goods foreign-based sellers ship to Canada, then house until they are sold and shipped domestically to local buyers. GST is collected on the wholesale value of the goods when they come across the border but the federal sales tax isn't always collected by sellers when the goods are sold to consumers. That creates a gap the Liberals want to close by either making sellers registered to collect the GST do so on the final sale price, or making platforms like Amazon responsible for it instead. The Liberals are promising to have the policy come into effect on July 1. There are sources of uncertainty within the estimate crafted by budget officer Yves Giroux's officials, including how much of the shift to online shopping caused by COVID-19 will remain when the pandemic recedes. The report was one of two released by Giroux's office on Thursday as it continues to cost out promises the Liberals made in November's economic statement. The second report estimated that a crackdown on tax cheats could yield close to $800 million in new revenue over a five years. Collection is likely to start slow by the budget office's forecasts, beginning with just $1 million in tax revenue this year, and rising each year thereafter. By 2026, the budget office suggests federal coffers could collect $782 million from Canadians using offshore tax havens or aggressive plans to reduce the amounts they would otherwise have to pay. To get there, the government will have to spend $606 million over the same period to boost the audit capacity at the Canada Revenue Agency to focus on those most likely to use such schemes, including wealthy Canadians. The report warns it is difficult to predict with certainty how much more spending will lead to the collection of extra tax revenue. Giroux's experts also write it is difficult to predict how taxpayers will respond to the beefed-up audit capacity at CRA, noting some may declare more of their offshore holdings, while others may find new ways to evade taxes that are harder to detect in audits. The report also said the extra audits could lead to more appeals, delaying when taxes are collected. The government suspended its audit activities for part of last year because of the pandemic and the Tax Court of Canada did not sit. The PBO report made note of those issues, pointing to comments from the court's chief justice, in a webinar earlier this month, warning of a deluge of appeals likely to be filed later this year.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 9.6 per cent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, according to a preliminary estimate released Tuesday by Statistics Canada. A flash estimate from the agency said the economy probably grew 0.5 per cent in January. Freeland said at a news conference she’s committed to spending through the COVID-19 crisis. “Our government will continue to do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to help Canadians through this bleak time, to prevent economic scarring and to invest in a way that allows us all to come roaring back after COVID-19,” she told reporters Wednesday in Ottawa. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has presided over some of the developed world’s largest deficits to help the economy during the pandemic. Canada’s deficit swelled to $248.2 billion in the nine months ended Dec. 31, compared to $11 billion in same period a year earlier. The borrowing has been driven by programs that send money to people and businesses that lost jobs and income because of the virus, which has killed 22,000 people in Canada. But some say the government went too far -- spending $20 in transfers to households last year for every dollar of regular income that was lost. “We are constantly, carefully evaluating government spending, government debt, jobs numbers and economic growth,” Freeland said. “We are prudent and we are responsible, but sometimes the greatest danger is not to act and we understand that risk, too.” This week’s GDP numbers have caused economists to begin raising their forecasts for 2021, and expectations for better growth are showing up in higher borrowing costs. The yield on 10-year Canada bonds was 1.41 per cent as of 1:11 p.m. Wednesday and the gap with comparable U.S. Treasuries -- 23.6 basis points at the start of the year -- has nearly vanished.

VIDEO SIGN OUT President Joe Biden’s US$1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill cleared its final congressional hurdle Wednesday, with the House passing the bill on a 220-to-211 vote, sending it to the president for his signature. The vote caps a nearly two-month sprint from the time Biden first unveiled his American Rescue Plan, through tough negotiations in the Senate to its final approval largely in the form it was first proposed. Biden plans to sign the legislation on Friday. The bill is a major political victory for the new president, displaying his influence over a Democratic Party in control of Congress by the thinnest of margins. At the same time, the partisan divide over the bill foreshadows the difficulty Biden will have in enacting the multi-trillion dollar, longer-term economic program he wants later this year. Most Americans will be receiving direct payments of US$1,400, with checks starting to go out within days. The bill provides new health-insurance subsidies and child-tax credits, while extending US$300 per week supplemental unemployment benefits into September. There’s also US$360 billion for state and local governments, a bailout for troubled union pensions and funds to ramp up vaccinations and school re-openings. Contributions to GDP From US$1.9 Trillion Plan “I join President Biden in his promise: help is on the way,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as debate concluded, noting that the vote came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the coronavirus being declared a pandemic and reciting the toll it’s wreaked on America. “This legislation puts nearly US$1 trillion in the pockets of the American people.” The Biden administration will focus on moving “swiftly” to implement the bill while also engaging officials -- beginning with the president and vice president -- to build public awareness and support for its provisions, White House deputy chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a Wednesday memo. The administration and Democratic lawmakers all plan to draw attention to 10 ways they say the bill will help Americans, from providing direct checks to giving support for small businesses to reopening schools. The White House plans days to address each theme. The legislation passed without a single Republican vote in either the House or Senate, in sharp contrast to the bipartisan five previous bipartisan COVID-19 bills enacted under President Donald Trump, before the pandemic began retreating amid the current vaccination drive. Representative Jared Golden of Maine was the lone Democratic no vote. He also had voted against the version that passed the House earlier. Republicans blasted Biden, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for rejecting more modest proposals. With the economy already on the rebound, they said the aid bill was excessive and will escalate financial risks. “You can’t just keep adding mountains of debt at hundreds of billions at a time” without consequence, said Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican. “When you look at the priorities of Speaker Pelosi, it’s to spend as much money as quickly as possible on her socialist agenda.” Republicans especially objected to the more than US$360 billion in state and local government funds being provided when many states are not showing any revenue loss during the pandemic. Senator Rick Scott of Florida issued a call to governors and majors to return to Washington any funding that’s in excess of “federally reimbursable COVID-19 related expenses.” A group of 11 Republican senators had proposed a US$650 billion stimulus plan with more narrowly targeted benefits and a focus on anti-virus efforts. Biden hosted most of them at the Oval Office, only to conclude the gulf between their idea and Democrats’ plans was too large to try to bridge. The bill is far bigger than initial Wall Street expectations of what could be accomplished in a closely divided Congress. Economists this week were upping their projections for growth to incorporate the impact. Morgan Stanley on Tuesday raised their 2021 forecast for U.S. economic growth to 7.3 per cent, a pace unsurpassed since the Korean War boom in 1951. Sustained Support The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that US$1.1 trillion of spending under the relief bill would go out this year, with a further US$476 billion coming in 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an MSNBC interview this week that the labor market would return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, in line with many major analyst forecasts. Help is targeted toward the lowest-earning Americans. A study from the Tax Policy Center found that incomes of the lowest fifth of earners will jump 20 per cent, the highest among income groups. That will help speed money into the economy, as those in the lowest brackets spend more of their budgets on basic household needs, including health care, food and clothing. About one-third of Americans plan to save their check, according to a survey by Morning Consult commissioned by Bloomberg News, much higher than the prior stimulus money. Around the same share said they’d purchase food, and one-quarter cited housing payments. “This will probably hit accounts before the end of the month,” said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies LLC. She upgraded forecasts mid-February that puts the U.S. on track to reach full employment by summer next year. “Not only does this get paid out quickly -- it actually gets spent very quickly.” The bill provides a template for a potential longer-term expansion of an American social-safety net that has long been much smaller than its European counterparts. Democrats say the near-US$110 billion temporary expansion of the child-tax credit will help cut child poverty in half, while tax forgiveness on jobless benefits and student-debt relief will give help to millions more. “This legislation represents the boldest action taken on behalf of the American people since the Great Depression,” Democratic House Caucus Vice-Chairman Pete Aguilar of California said. The heated politics around the stimulus bill could jeopardize Biden’s hopes for a bipartisan infrastructure program, along with challenging plans for an immigration bill, voting reform, war powers reform or gun-safety measures. Such legislation is likely to be largely ineligible for the fast-track Senate procedure used to bypass a Republican filibuster, known as budget reconciliation. “It’s a bad start, and it’s going to make it much more difficult to get things done,” said veteran Republican lawmaker Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who claimed that GOP members could have ended up backing up to US$900 billion in relief. “I would hope we can find common ground, but I just look at the legislation they keep bringing up.” Democrats counter that Republicans are dusting off their playbook from more than a decade ago, when blasting the Obama administration over deficit spending, along with a lackluster recovery, helped win control of the House in 2010. “Partisanship is at a high level within the congressional chamber because Republicans have chosen obstruction over cooperation,” said Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 4 House Democrat. The popularity of the stimulus bill, and especially the direct payments that were first championed by Trump, are being employed by Democrats in their bid to defy historical trends during midterm elections by holding onto the House in the 2022. While 2021 will prove memorable as a phase of “proactive fiscal expansion,” it’s far from clear this will last, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Michael Zezas wrote in a report dated March 10. “We would not conclude this is the beginning of a long-term trend, as a change in power in the midterm elections and/or a resurgence of popular concern regarding deficits could derail the trend beyond this year,” the Morgan Stanley team wrote.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 9.6 per cent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, according to a preliminary estimate released Tuesday by Statistics Canada. A flash estimate from the agency said the economy probably grew 0.5 per cent in January. Freeland said at a news conference she’s committed to spending through the COVID-19 crisis. “Our government will continue to do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to help Canadians through this bleak time, to prevent economic scarring and to invest in a way that allows us all to come roaring back after COVID-19,” she told reporters Wednesday in Ottawa. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has presided over some of the developed world’s largest deficits to help the economy during the pandemic. Canada’s deficit swelled to $248.2 billion in the nine months ended Dec. 31, compared to $11 billion in same period a year earlier. The borrowing has been driven by programs that send money to people and businesses that lost jobs and income because of the virus, which has killed 22,000 people in Canada. But some say the government went too far -- spending $20 in transfers to households last year for every dollar of regular income that was lost. “We are constantly, carefully evaluating government spending, government debt, jobs numbers and economic growth,” Freeland said. “We are prudent and we are responsible, but sometimes the greatest danger is not to act and we understand that risk, too.” This week’s GDP numbers have caused economists to begin raising their forecasts for 2021, and expectations for better growth are showing up in higher borrowing costs. The yield on 10-year Canada bonds was 1.41 per cent as of 1:11 p.m. Wednesday and the gap with comparable U.S. Treasuries -- 23.6 basis points at the start of the year -- has nearly vanished.

The IMF said clear communication about how the federal government plans to unwind its relief policies will be key to managing expectations and maintaining policy credibility over the medium-term. While the government telegraphed that it will take a data-driven view in mapping out the timeline for removing the measures, the Fund says more clarity is needed, especially as the federal deficit balloons. Canada took on more debt as a share of its GDP than its G7 peers to cushion its economy against the pandemic. The federal government predicted in its Fall Economic Statement last year that its debt load would top $1 trillion, or 55.5 per cent of GDP, by 2024. Now that the worst of the pandemic is largely believed to be over, the focus should turn to how Canada plans to pay down the accumulated debt, the IMF said. “The recent sharp rise in public debt increases the importance of clearly specifying a medium-term fiscal anchor—something staff has long advocated—to guard against a potential weakening of credibility in the fiscal framework,” the IMF said. The federal government plans to release a budget this spring, more than two years since its last full fiscal update. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instructed Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland to use ""whatever fiscal firepower"" is needed to tackle short-term challenges while also establishing a “fiscal anchor” and avoiding any new permanent spending.

The order imposes restrictions on businesses and residents across the Canadian province of 14.7 million people, beginning April 3. Restaurants won’t be allowed to serve customers except for takeout and delivery orders; indoor public events are banned, with a few exceptions. Supermarkets and pharmacies will operate at 50 per cent capacity and other retailers at 25 per cent. Toronto and some other regions are already under similar rules. The government’s move tightens them further and extends them throughout the province, including Ottawa, Canada’s capital. “The variants of concern are spreading rapidly. This is a new pandemic. We are now fighting a new enemy,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. “Please understand folks, this decision weighs extremely heavy on me.” Ontario joins a growing number of locations, including France and Italy, that are returning to strict limits on social interactions in an effort to slow the latest virus surge. Even as vaccinations continue, not every area has equal access. Novel variants are hastening the spread, and case rates are rising in many regions. Ford and provincial health officials were asked why the government would extend measures that are largely the same as those already in place in Toronto and that have failed to prevent a rise in COVID-19 cases there. But health officials argued that the situation in Toronto would be much worse if not for its lockdown, because the virus is more contagious than it was earlier in the pandemic. “As the new variant spreads, you will see that Covid is killing faster and younger. It’s spreading far more quickly than it was before and we cannot vaccinate quickly enough to break this third wave,” Adalsteinn Brown, a doctor who is co-chair of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said at a separate news conference Thursday. Officials said the main variant spreading in the province -- known as B.1.1.7 -- is 50 per cent more lethal, twice as likely to send patients to intensive care units and three times as likely to require ventilation. Variants of concern are also affecting younger patients: Almost half of those admitted to ICUs from March 15 to March 21 were under age 60. Ontario hospitals are under strain, Brown said, with some entire families ending up in intensive care. There are 430 COVID-19 patients in ICUs. Meanwhile, only 64 per cent of the over-80 population is vaccinated, excluding those at long-term care facilities. That drops to 39 per cent for people 75 to 79 years old and 16 per cent for those 70 to 74. Overall, Canada has fully vaccinated less than 2 per cent of its population, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. In Canada, a recent rise in cases has meant tighter restrictions in a number of provinces. Quebec said Wednesday it would close schools and non-essential stores for 10 days in two regions. British Columbia, which had managed to dodge the worst of the pandemic, has closed indoor dining, worship services and most indoor fitness activities for three weeks. Canada’s coronavirus efforts were complicated on Monday when health officials across Canada suspended the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine for people under 55 for fear of blood clots. In Ontario, Ford has criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government for failing to deliver adequate vaccine supplies to the province. “The bottom line is, we need more time,” Ford said Thursday. “We need more time for our vaccine program to take hold.” Ontario reported 2,557 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing its total case count to 352,460, according to Public Health Ontario. Almost 17,100 residents have been hospitalized because of the disease, and 7,389 have died from it. --With assistance from Zoe Ma and Michelle Fay Cortez.

Canada’s banking regulator signaled its intent Thursday to take a small step by tightening qualification rules for uninsured mortgages, worried that low interest rates will put new home buyers too far into debt. The move will effectively reduce by about 4% the size of mortgages households will be eligible to take. With buyers straining ever more to get in amid the frenzy, expectations are building that move will be only the first step in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s efforts to keep a long-feared housing bubble from forming, and popping, on his watch. To do so, his government must bring the one part of the economy that’s at a boil down to a simmer, without triggering a sharp correction that could disrupt the nation’s recovery from COVID-19. Driven by record low interest rates and induced demand for larger space, the value of Canadian residential real estate has surged 17 per cent in the last 12 months. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said she’d be watching the regulator’s move closely “to inform potential steps the government may take” on housing. “You need something to cool the jets of the market because this thing is just going too high too fast, and that could potentially leave people out to dry,” Rob McLister, the mortgage editor at financial-services agreggator and marketplace Rates.ca, said by phone. “There’s just all sorts of things that could potentially go wrong when home prices are going vertical.” Psychologically Insufficient The midday announcement by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions kicked off a consultative period before the stress test rate climbs to 5.25 per cent, from 4.79 per cent currently, on June 1. Several of the bank economists who have been some of the loudest voices calling for the government to cool the housing market immediately said more was needed. “The tone and the psychology of the market might not change all that much,” Robert Kavcic of Bank of Montreal said in a report to investors, estimating the buying power of a $1 million (US$800,000) mortgage would probably shrink by just C$45,000 under the new rule. “We doubt this alone will significantly cool the housing market,” economists from National Bank of Canada chimed in. Because newly common remote-work policies are allowing high earners in big cities to look further afield for their dream home, the bidding wars and affordability issues long seen in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal are being exported to communities across the country. Twelve major markets -- or about one quarter of the total -- have posted price gains of more than 30 per cent, according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association. That’s fueling concern that prices could end up falling as fast as they’ve risen, destabilizing the broader economy, or leave those who don’t already own property with no hope of ever getting into the market. With the Bank of Canada signaling interest rates will remain low for a long while yet, that leaves Trudeau’s government holding more limited tools to tackle housing. The most obvious next step would be to carry the banking regulator’s more stringent proposed stress test for uninsured mortgages over to the ones insured by the government, where the borrower has to put less money down. “I would be surprised if Freeland didn’t do something similar on the insured product,” Derek Holt, an economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, said by email. “I wouldn’t get the logic behind tightening stress tests on lower ratio mortgages when the strains are more likely on the high ratio end of the spectrum.” Capital-Gains Exemption Other policy options that have been proposed by economists outside government include a tax targeting speculative activity like the one recently introduced in New Zealand, and an end to the exemption from capital gains taxes for primary residences. Though the Trudeau government hasn’t indicated it’s considering these, it did say in November that it plans to put a levy on non-resident home buyers. Similar taxes implemented to combat more localized surges in home values in Vancouver and Toronto, along with an earlier round of stricter mortgage stress tests implemented nationally in 2018, did help to rein in surging house prices in those cities for a time. But the tightening of the stress test then was about four times as steep as the one currently proposed, according to Bank of Montreal research. The chief banking regulator, Jeremy Rudin, also indicated in a media call that his agency would be monitoring lenders to ensure strict adherence to income verification protocols, and to make sure they aren’t extending amortization periods or increasing debt servicing limits for borrowers. For many of Canada’s large banks and others involved in the real estate market, such steps to tamp down demand miss the root of the problem, which is a lack of homes people want to buy. “We need more stock, consumer preferences are changing,” David McKay, chief executive officer of Royal Bank of Canada, told reporters after the bank’s annual general meeting. “Some action will be necessary to cool this in the short term, but it’s modest and we don’t need to overreact to this. We can tweak some of our policies, try to slow down demand while supply catches up.” Related Policy-makers should tackle housing supply with density, transit: CIBC CEO 'Wrenching adjustment' awaits feds if debt is unchecked: C.D.

Revised in 2016, the current guidelines urge lenders to implement a stress test on prospective borrowers by verifying employment status and income history. These measures were put in place to ensure that borrowers would be able to pay their mortgage, which McKay applauded. “The B-20 rules that we implemented a number of years ago were effective in suppressing demand and cooling things in the short-term,” he said. “Therefore, the infrastructure is already there, we can make tweaks to that policy…” In light of the recent run-up in housing prices, OSFI proposed tougher measures on Thursday. This time, the proposed stress test would set the minimum qualifying rate for uninsured mortgages at the contract rate plus two percentage points, or 5.25 per cent, depending on which rate is higher. “I am encouraged that that is an implementable short-term policy that does withdraw some borrowers who are stretching themselves too much with low rates and too large a house,” McKay said. McKay added that another issue in the housing problem is that the supply currently under construction isn’t meeting consumer demand as homebuyers have fled to the suburbs in search of more space. “There’s a change in preferences, a change in consumer needs that are at-odds a little bit with urban planning,” McKay explained. “We’re trying to densify and go into smaller units vertically whereas what consumers want… is more space, planning for a hybrid world in the future inside cities and more urban, rural areas.” The recent wave of lockdown measures in COVID-19 hotspot provinces like Ontario will do nothing to pause demand, according to McKay. “I think it’ll be persistent. I don’t think it’s going away because of a lockdown.” Related OSFI proposes tighter mortgage rules amid 'very strong forces' Policy-makers should tackle housing supply with density, transit: CIBC CEO Banks have the tools to deflate a housing bubble Top Stories 3:17 Trudeau likely just getting started in bid to ease housing fever 12:21 Housing policy must cool market imbalance: RBC CEO 6:49 OSFI proposes tighter mortgage rules amid 'very strong forces' Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

In a research note published Sunday, Scotiabank Chief Economist Jean-François Perrault said such a tax would only serve as a blunt instrument to take some of the heat out of the red-hot residential real estate sector and would not address deeper structural issues. ""A more significant revision to capital gains on principal residences should not be considered. The tax-sheltered gains from owning a home confer a significant advantage to homeowners versus renters,"" he said. ""As tempting as it might be to reduce this advantage by taxing a portion of the capital gains on a principal residence, such a change in taxation would represent a significant financial blow to Canadians."" The call comes in the wake of RBC Senior Economist Robert Hogue’s recent argument that policymakers should put everything on the table to tame runaway housing markets in Canada, including ""sacred cows"" like a capital gains tax on primary residences. Currently, gains on the price appreciation of a principal residence are not taxed in Canada, though any appreciation on secondary residences like a cottage are subject to a tax. A capital gains tax on principal residences could theoretically slow down home sale activity, and it would present a sea-change in Canadian housing policy that would catch many current homeowners flat-footed. Perrault said such an abrupt change in the taxation regime and any further tweaks to protect current homeowners from its ill-effects could ultimately create an unfair, two-tiered taxation framework. “Policymakers could get around [changing taxation for current homeowners] by limiting the tax to those that purchase homes in the future, or by imposing a cap on these tax-sheltered gains but that would raise inter-generational equity issues: why would there be a differential tax treatment for new homeowners relative to existing ones? To reduce the incentive to own over renting, a better approach would be to allow a certain portion of rents to be deducted from income,"" he said. Chief among the concerns being raised in the current home price cycle is the acceleration in prices outside of Canada's largest cities. Though average home prices in Toronto and Vancouver have eclipsed $1 million through the pandemic, the heat has bled into bedroom communities, pushing prices in some outlying areas up more than 30 per cent over the past year. The combination of rock-bottom interest rates and increased flexibility in work-from-home arrangements has helped fuel that fire in domestic markets, and there are few signs monetary policy action will take any heat out of the trend, with the Bank of Canada signalling it plans to keep its policy rate at the effective lower bound until at least 2023 to help support the economic recovery. While Perrault thinks a major move like the capital gains tax should be off the table, he did say that ultimately Canada needs to address the supply side of the housing equation in order to deal with the problem of rapidly accelerating prices and overall housing precarity, but warned such measures would take time. ""The overwhelming challenge facing the Canadian housing market remains the chronic insufficiency of supply relative to demand owing to the high rates of population growth registered in recent years,"" he said. ""While not a near-term solution, policymakers should respond by easing obstacles to new construction for all forms of housing—affordable housing, rentals and owned accommodations.""

The order imposes restrictions on businesses and residents across the Canadian province of 14.7 million people, beginning April 3. Restaurants won’t be allowed to serve customers except for takeout and delivery orders; indoor public events are banned, with a few exceptions. Supermarkets and pharmacies will operate at 50 per cent capacity and other retailers at 25 per cent. Toronto and some other regions are already under similar rules. The government’s move tightens them further and extends them throughout the province, including Ottawa, Canada’s capital. “The variants of concern are spreading rapidly. This is a new pandemic. We are now fighting a new enemy,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. “Please understand folks, this decision weighs extremely heavy on me.” Ontario joins a growing number of locations, including France and Italy, that are returning to strict limits on social interactions in an effort to slow the latest virus surge. Even as vaccinations continue, not every area has equal access. Novel variants are hastening the spread, and case rates are rising in many regions. Ford and provincial health officials were asked why the government would extend measures that are largely the same as those already in place in Toronto and that have failed to prevent a rise in COVID-19 cases there. But health officials argued that the situation in Toronto would be much worse if not for its lockdown, because the virus is more contagious than it was earlier in the pandemic. “As the new variant spreads, you will see that Covid is killing faster and younger. It’s spreading far more quickly than it was before and we cannot vaccinate quickly enough to break this third wave,” Adalsteinn Brown, a doctor who is co-chair of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, said at a separate news conference Thursday. Officials said the main variant spreading in the province -- known as B.1.1.7 -- is 50 per cent more lethal, twice as likely to send patients to intensive care units and three times as likely to require ventilation. Variants of concern are also affecting younger patients: Almost half of those admitted to ICUs from March 15 to March 21 were under age 60. Ontario hospitals are under strain, Brown said, with some entire families ending up in intensive care. There are 430 COVID-19 patients in ICUs. Meanwhile, only 64 per cent of the over-80 population is vaccinated, excluding those at long-term care facilities. That drops to 39 per cent for people 75 to 79 years old and 16 per cent for those 70 to 74. Overall, Canada has fully vaccinated less than 2 per cent of its population, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. In Canada, a recent rise in cases has meant tighter restrictions in a number of provinces. Quebec said Wednesday it would close schools and non-essential stores for 10 days in two regions. British Columbia, which had managed to dodge the worst of the pandemic, has closed indoor dining, worship services and most indoor fitness activities for three weeks. Canada’s coronavirus efforts were complicated on Monday when health officials across Canada suspended the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine for people under 55 for fear of blood clots. In Ontario, Ford has criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government for failing to deliver adequate vaccine supplies to the province. “The bottom line is, we need more time,” Ford said Thursday. “We need more time for our vaccine program to take hold.” Ontario reported 2,557 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing its total case count to 352,460, according to Public Health Ontario. Almost 17,100 residents have been hospitalized because of the disease, and 7,389 have died from it. --With assistance from Zoe Ma and Michelle Fay Cortez.

Canada’s banking regulator signaled its intent Thursday to take a small step by tightening qualification rules for uninsured mortgages, worried that low interest rates will put new home buyers too far into debt. The move will effectively reduce by about 4% the size of mortgages households will be eligible to take. With buyers straining ever more to get in amid the frenzy, expectations are building that move will be only the first step in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s efforts to keep a long-feared housing bubble from forming, and popping, on his watch. To do so, his government must bring the one part of the economy that’s at a boil down to a simmer, without triggering a sharp correction that could disrupt the nation’s recovery from COVID-19. Driven by record low interest rates and induced demand for larger space, the value of Canadian residential real estate has surged 17 per cent in the last 12 months. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said she’d be watching the regulator’s move closely “to inform potential steps the government may take” on housing. “You need something to cool the jets of the market because this thing is just going too high too fast, and that could potentially leave people out to dry,” Rob McLister, the mortgage editor at financial-services agreggator and marketplace Rates.ca, said by phone. “There’s just all sorts of things that could potentially go wrong when home prices are going vertical.” Psychologically Insufficient The midday announcement by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions kicked off a consultative period before the stress test rate climbs to 5.25 per cent, from 4.79 per cent currently, on June 1. Several of the bank economists who have been some of the loudest voices calling for the government to cool the housing market immediately said more was needed. “The tone and the psychology of the market might not change all that much,” Robert Kavcic of Bank of Montreal said in a report to investors, estimating the buying power of a $1 million (US$800,000) mortgage would probably shrink by just C$45,000 under the new rule. “We doubt this alone will significantly cool the housing market,” economists from National Bank of Canada chimed in. Because newly common remote-work policies are allowing high earners in big cities to look further afield for their dream home, the bidding wars and affordability issues long seen in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal are being exported to communities across the country. Twelve major markets -- or about one quarter of the total -- have posted price gains of more than 30 per cent, according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association. That’s fueling concern that prices could end up falling as fast as they’ve risen, destabilizing the broader economy, or leave those who don’t already own property with no hope of ever getting into the market. With the Bank of Canada signaling interest rates will remain low for a long while yet, that leaves Trudeau’s government holding more limited tools to tackle housing. The most obvious next step would be to carry the banking regulator’s more stringent proposed stress test for uninsured mortgages over to the ones insured by the government, where the borrower has to put less money down. “I would be surprised if Freeland didn’t do something similar on the insured product,” Derek Holt, an economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, said by email. “I wouldn’t get the logic behind tightening stress tests on lower ratio mortgages when the strains are more likely on the high ratio end of the spectrum.” Capital-Gains Exemption Other policy options that have been proposed by economists outside government include a tax targeting speculative activity like the one recently introduced in New Zealand, and an end to the exemption from capital gains taxes for primary residences. Though the Trudeau government hasn’t indicated it’s considering these, it did say in November that it plans to put a levy on non-resident home buyers. Similar taxes implemented to combat more localized surges in home values in Vancouver and Toronto, along with an earlier round of stricter mortgage stress tests implemented nationally in 2018, did help to rein in surging house prices in those cities for a time. But the tightening of the stress test then was about four times as steep as the one currently proposed, according to Bank of Montreal research. The chief banking regulator, Jeremy Rudin, also indicated in a media call that his agency would be monitoring lenders to ensure strict adherence to income verification protocols, and to make sure they aren’t extending amortization periods or increasing debt servicing limits for borrowers. For many of Canada’s large banks and others involved in the real estate market, such steps to tamp down demand miss the root of the problem, which is a lack of homes people want to buy. “We need more stock, consumer preferences are changing,” David McKay, chief executive officer of Royal Bank of Canada, told reporters after the bank’s annual general meeting. “Some action will be necessary to cool this in the short term, but it’s modest and we don’t need to overreact to this. We can tweak some of our policies, try to slow down demand while supply catches up.” Related Policy-makers should tackle housing supply with density, transit: CIBC CEO 'Wrenching adjustment' awaits feds if debt is unchecked: C.D.

Revised in 2016, the current guidelines urge lenders to implement a stress test on prospective borrowers by verifying employment status and income history. These measures were put in place to ensure that borrowers would be able to pay their mortgage, which McKay applauded. “The B-20 rules that we implemented a number of years ago were effective in suppressing demand and cooling things in the short-term,” he said. “Therefore, the infrastructure is already there, we can make tweaks to that policy…” In light of the recent run-up in housing prices, OSFI proposed tougher measures on Thursday. This time, the proposed stress test would set the minimum qualifying rate for uninsured mortgages at the contract rate plus two percentage points, or 5.25 per cent, depending on which rate is higher. “I am encouraged that that is an implementable short-term policy that does withdraw some borrowers who are stretching themselves too much with low rates and too large a house,” McKay said. McKay added that another issue in the housing problem is that the supply currently under construction isn’t meeting consumer demand as homebuyers have fled to the suburbs in search of more space. “There’s a change in preferences, a change in consumer needs that are at-odds a little bit with urban planning,” McKay explained. “We’re trying to densify and go into smaller units vertically whereas what consumers want… is more space, planning for a hybrid world in the future inside cities and more urban, rural areas.” The recent wave of lockdown measures in COVID-19 hotspot provinces like Ontario will do nothing to pause demand, according to McKay. “I think it’ll be persistent. I don’t think it’s going away because of a lockdown.” Related OSFI proposes tighter mortgage rules amid 'very strong forces' Policy-makers should tackle housing supply with density, transit: CIBC CEO Banks have the tools to deflate a housing bubble Top Stories U.S. housing starts soar after winter-related setback 7:56 New housing measures risk 'unintended consequences': TD 6:51 Scotia's global markets chief sees role for banks in Canada housing crunch Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

The plan would boost the capital gains rate to 39.6 per cent for those earning US$1 million or more, an increase from the current base rate of 20 per cent, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. A 3.8 per cent tax on investment income that funds Obamacare would be kept in place, pushing the tax rate on returns on financial assets higher than the top rate on wage and salary income, they said. Stocks slid on news about the plan, with the S&P 500 Index down 0.7 per cent as of 1:43 p.m. after climbing 0.2 per cent earlier. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent after rising as much as 0.5 per cent. Ten-year Treasury yields erased gains. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor. Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for wealthy individuals, saying it’s unfair that many of them pay lower rates than middle-class workers. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and the Treasury Department declined to comment. Biden is expected to release the proposal next week as part of the tax increases to fund social spending in the forthcoming “American Families Plan.” That proposal, expected at around US$1 trillion, will come as Congress debates how to proceed on Biden’s separate US$2.25 trillion infrastructure-focused package known as the American Jobs Plan, which would be funded by tax increases on corporations. It also follows the US$1.9 trillion coronavirus-relief bill passed in March. The families plan is set to include a wave of new spending on children and education, including a temporary extension of an expanded child tax credit that would give parents up to US$300 a month for young children or US$250 for those six and older. The capital gains increase would raise US$370 billion over a decade, according to an estimate from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center based on Biden’s campaign platform. State Levies For US$1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50 per cent. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22 per cent. For Californians, it could be 56.7 per cent. Democrats have said current capital gains rates largely help top earners who get their income through investments rather than in the form of wages, resulting in lower tax rates for wealthy people than those they employ. Republicans argue that the current framework encourages saving and promote future economic growth. Capital gains taxes are paid when an asset is sold, and are applied to the amount of appreciation on the asset from when it was bought to when it is sold. Congressional Democrats have separately proposed a series of changes to capital-gains taxation, including imposing the levies annually instead of when they are sold.

Policy makers led by Governor Tiff Macklem said Wednesday they would scale back their purchases of government debt by a quarter to $3 billion (US$2.4 billion) and accelerate the timetable for a possible interest-rate increase. The upbeat turn toward plotting a return to more normal policy has been resisted by counterparts elsewhere, including the U.S. Federal Reserve. Investors reacted by boosting the Canadian dollar to its highest since January. “This is a fairly hawkish message cast by the Bank of Canada,” Simon Harvey, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Monex Canada, said by email. “They seem quite confident that once the current wave of infections subsides the economic recovery will be robust.” The central bank reiterated its guidance that it won’t raise its benchmark interest rate, currently at 0.25 per cent, until the recovery is complete and inflation is sustainably at 2 per cent. But it changed its projections on when that would happen. New Timeline In new quarterly economic projections, it revised higher its growth estimate for 2021 by more than two percentage points, to 6.5 per cent, and brought forward its forecasts for when slack would be absorbed. “Based on the Bank’s latest projection, this is now expected to happen some time in the second half of 2022,” the bank said in its latest Monetary Policy Report. At a subsequent press conference, Macklem emphasized that the central bank’s commitment is not to raise interest rates before the economy fully recovers, and that any future hike would reflect economic conditions at the time. The Federal Reserve, by contrast, says it won’t begin scaling back the pace of its US$120 billion-a-month bond purchases until it sees “substantial further progress” on employment and inflation. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of the Fed’s March meeting didn’t expect that to happen until 2022. Macklem’s growth revisions bring policy makers more into line with economist projections. Markets had already been pricing in a rate increase in 2022 before Wednesday’s changes. Investors have also been anticipating that Canada’s central bank would be more aggressive than the Federal Reserve in its normalization path. Swaps trading suggests about a 50 per cent chance of a hike in Canada this time next year. Almost three hikes are fully priced in over the next two years, and five hikes over the next three years. Chair Jerome Powell, for his part, has been careful to avoid putting a date on beginning to taper asset purchases in the U.S., though his No. 2, Vice Chair Richard Clarida, has said he doesn’t expect those thresholds to be met this year. Powell has promised to give investors plenty of warning that officials are beginning to debate the timing of a move. He’s been up front in wanting to avoid surprising markets and re-running the 2013 Taper Tantrum, when unexpected news that the Fed was thinking of paring its purchases sent financial markets into a spasm with harmful economic consequences. Loonie Soars The Canadian dollar rose as much as 0.8 per cent to $1.2510 per U.S. dollar. The market consensus was for the Bank of Canada to pare back its government bond purchases in line with the bank’s new guidance, without altering expectations for no rate hike before 2023. Even before Wednesday’s statement, investors were anticipating the Bank of Canada to be among the most aggressive advanced economies in unwinding stimulus. One reason may be that Canada’s jobs market has recouped 90 per cent of losses during the pandemic, versus just over 60 per cent in the U.S. Still, policy makers remain cautious despite the more positive tone, saying there’s more uncertainty than usual that might affect its estimates for slack. Officials also highlighted concern about the uneven recovery and the potential for scarring in the labor market. On technical grounds alone, the central bank’s purchases of Canadian government bonds need to be pared back as the government’s financing requirements drop. It now owns more than 40 per cent of outstanding bonds and is on pace to go above 50 per cent in a few months as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government reduces its issuance by about $90 billion this year. It’s actually the second time the Bank of Canada has tapered during the pandemic. Macklem reduced the bank’s minimum weekly purchases in October, which had been $5 billion initially. But at the time, officials characterized the taper as neutral in terms of stimulus, because they shifted purchases toward long-term bonds concurrently. This time, the central bank acknowledges that its reduction in purchases will have an “incremental” impact on stimulus.

More Video Investing Technology News Wire Apr 28, 2021 Bitcoin is facing a make-or-break moment: technical analysis Vildana Hajric and Lu Wang, Bloomberg News Not surprising if we end the year with Bitcoin through 100,000: BlockTower Capital's Bucella VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} Bitcoin is facing a make-or-break moment following a recent bout of selling, according to technical analysis. Though the cryptocurrency has rebounded above its average price over the past 100 days, it’s still trading below its 50-day moving average. Such a dynamic typically indicates an asset is nearing an inflection point. If Bitcoin can’t overtake its 50-day mean -- which currently sits at about US$57,000 -- then it might be in for a period of volatility as the gap between the two trend lines converges. Technical indicators suggest breaking out might not be an easy feat -- Bitcoin failed to do so on several occasions last week. Trading in the world’s largest digital asset has been choppy in recent days after it hit a record high in mid-April above US$64,000. It’s down more than 15 per cent since then, though it rebounded earlier this week amid positive news, including comments from Tesla Inc.’s chief financial officer that reiterated the company’s commitment to the cryptocurrency. “The drastic -- relative to what we’ve seen of late -- pullback certainly was a point of eyebrows being raised, but at the end of the day, I think the fact that things were able to rebound and stabilize is a good thing,” said David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. “It shows real power to the token, the staying power to the asset class.” The coin fell 1.4 per cent on Wednesday following an announcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will delay a decision on a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. It was at about US$54,586 as of 9:43 a.m. in Hong Kong Thursday. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, says that if the stock market continues its advance, he expected Bitcoin to follow. Despite its recent turbulence, Bitcoin is still up 511 per cent over the past year. Inflation and central bank policies have been its biggest drivers during the past 12 months, according to Quant Insight, a London-based analytics research firm that studies the relationship between assets and macro factors. While some dispute the idea that Bitcoin can act as an inflation hedge, the argument has been a key tenet for its bullish thesis and rings true for a lot of crypto fans. Proponents have seized on the money-printing narrative to promote the notion that Bitcoin is a store of wealth, an explanation that’s gained traction in recent months with economists expecting price pressures to pick up. “No question about it -- what drives a big chunk of the interest in Bitcoin has been just the tremendous amount of money that has been printed and will be printed and really the fundamental thought that you cannot have that much money in the system and not have it be inflationary,” said Chuck Cumello, president and chief executive officer of Essex Financial Services.

Like his counterpart in the White House, he’s being pummeled by his political opponents for it. Canada’s land border with the U.S., the world’s longest, has been shut to many foreign travelers for more than 13 months. Non-essential workers entering the country are required to quarantine for two weeks. The rules have blocked tourists, kept families apart, prevented students from visiting college campuses and hurt trade-dependent manufacturers. But new variants of COVID-19 still arrive and a third wave has raged across parts of Canada. Trudeau finds himself squeezed between two groups. On one side are critics including doctors and the premiers of Ontario and Quebec, who say loopholes in its travel rules and weak controls at airports have made the situation worse. On the other are businesses calling for the prime minister to loosen restrictions, or at least outline a plan for doing so. In a country that sends more than 70 per cent of its exports to the U.S., the border matters a lot. Trucks and trains continue to move goods despite the pandemic, but Canada’s tourism and travel-related businesses lost an estimated $19.4 billion (US$15.6 billion) in revenue last year from the plunge in international visitors. Manufacturers are feeling the pain, too. From his base in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit, Tim Galbraith competes with American companies to build industrial molds for U.S. factories. Border rules are costing him business with U.S. customers. Technical experts won’t cross the border for key tasks, including testing out a mold before it ships, and prospective American clients won’t visit because of the quarantine. “There’s no chance this guy is going to come and sit in a hotel for 14 days, just so he can come and spend 3 hours in our plant and drive home,” said Galbraith, sales manager at Cavalier Tool & Manufacturing Ltd. “This is a trade barrier the Canadian government has erected that is doing more to repatriate business in the U.S., in our industry, than all the Trump rhetoric of the last four years.” A quick reopening seems unlikely. It’s not merely that Canada has a lot of virus cases, but a lot of serious ones. Ontario has about 850 people in intensive care units, and the number has more than doubled in a month. The province is under an emergency stay-at-home order. Nationally, the mood is cautious. In a Leger poll conducted for the Association of Canadian Studies last month, 70 per cent of Canadians said they worried about reopening the border with the U.S., versus 31 per cent of Americans. Cases have jumped since the poll was taken, along with criticism of politicians at all levels of government for not doing enough. Attitudes may change once more progress is made on vaccines. About 25 per cent of Canadians have their first shot but just 2.4 per cent are fully vaccinated, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. APR 25: #COVID19 in #Ontario 3947 cases, 24 deaths, 4239 resolved* 46694 tests/day, 25641 pending, 8.7% pos 2126 hospitalized (851 in ICU)🏥 4,626,903 vaccinations (+99,535)💉 See thread for more graphs📈⤵️#onhealth #COVID19ontario pic.twitter.com/rXQTxqLLh8 — Dr. Jennifer Kwan (@jkwan_md) April 25, 2021 For the battered tourism industry, that may mean a second summer of empty hotel rooms and restaurants. “What people don’t understand, too, is the huge connectedness between Canada and the U.S, especially in the border regions where we’re quite used to just going over to have dinner,” said Marta Leardi-Anderson, the executive director of the Cross-Border Institute at the University of Windsor. American tourists are missed at Le Priori, a boutique hotel nestled in Quebec City’s historic neighborhood where they usually make up a quarter of guests. Many visit after ending a cruise on the St. Lawrence River, spending freely and helping stretch the summer tourism season into the fall, general manager Erwan Franchet said. Now, cruises are banned until 2022, Quebec’s capital city is in lockdown, and it’s still unclear how quickly vaccination will unlock borders. Border Blues Franchet expects visitors from other parts of Quebec this summer, but no end to the crisis until the end of the year. He worries the industry, which faces current occupation rates around 10 per cent, may lose some players by then. “There will be a huge demand for travel, everyone on the planet will compete to attract tourists and refill their coffers,” he said. “We must show up for it.” About 550 miles to the southwest, at one of Canada’s most famous natural wonders, the president of Niagara Falls Tourism believes that moment may come as soon as the summer. The town welcomed only 36 per cent of its usual 14 million visitors last year, but Janice Thomson pins her hopes on vaccination and rapid testing at the border. “Those will give everyone confidence to travel and to get back at experiencing what we’re used to,” she said. On the opposite side of the Niagara River, U.S. Congressman Brian Higgins is losing patience. His district, which includes Buffalo, took a massive hit from losing Canadian visitors at its airport, shops and sports arenas, he said. Higgins has been pressing President Joe Biden to obtain exemptions for U.S. residents wanting to reunite with loved ones or access their property in Canada. He’s also pushing for a full reopening by July. “My people are being denied access to Canada,” he said. Yet “with vaccines, the verification of vaccines, and wearing face masks, the likelihood of getting COVID-19 and the likelihood of giving COVID-19 is very, very low.” Galbraith, from the Windsor mold-making company, says months of alerting authorities about the impact of current rules has gained the industry some support in its effort to exempt some technicians from quarantine. Manufacturing GDP dropped almost 10 per cent last year and employment also fell, data show. “They’re seeing the fact that we’re not crying wolf,” he said. “We’re really losing business.” --With assistance from Kait Bolongaro.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Investing News Wire Apr 22, 2021 Biden eyeing capital gains tax as high as 43.4 per cent for wealthy Laura Davison and Allyson Versprille, Bloomberg News Yellen pushes for global minimum corporate tax rate VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} President Joe Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals to 39.6 per cent, which, coupled with an existing surtax on investment income, means that federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4 per cent, according to people familiar with the proposal. The plan would boost the capital gains rate to 39.6 per cent for those earning US$1 million or more, an increase from the current base rate of 20 per cent, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. A 3.8 per cent tax on investment income that funds Obamacare would be kept in place, pushing the tax rate on returns on financial assets higher than the top rate on wage and salary income, they said. Stocks slid on news about the plan, with the S&P 500 Index down 0.7 per cent as of 1:43 p.m. after climbing 0.2 per cent earlier. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent after rising as much as 0.5 per cent. Ten-year Treasury yields erased gains. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor. Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for wealthy individuals, saying it’s unfair that many of them pay lower rates than middle-class workers. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and the Treasury Department declined to comment. Biden is expected to release the proposal next week as part of the tax increases to fund social spending in the forthcoming “American Families Plan.” That proposal, expected at around US$1 trillion, will come as Congress debates how to proceed on Biden’s separate US$2.25 trillion infrastructure-focused package known as the American Jobs Plan, which would be funded by tax increases on corporations. It also follows the US$1.9 trillion coronavirus-relief bill passed in March. The families plan is set to include a wave of new spending on children and education, including a temporary extension of an expanded child tax credit that would give parents up to US$300 a month for young children or US$250 for those six and older. The capital gains increase would raise US$370 billion over a decade, according to an estimate from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center based on Biden’s campaign platform. State Levies For US$1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50 per cent. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22 per cent. For Californians, it could be 56.7 per cent. Democrats have said current capital gains rates largely help top earners who get their income through investments rather than in the form of wages, resulting in lower tax rates for wealthy people than those they employ. Republicans argue that the current framework encourages saving and promote future economic growth. Capital gains taxes are paid when an asset is sold, and are applied to the amount of appreciation on the asset from when it was bought to when it is sold. Congressional Democrats have separately proposed a series of changes to capital-gains taxation, including imposing the levies annually instead of when they are sold.

The number of homes to change hands could climb as high as 602,300 this year from about 550,000 sales seen last year, according to a report released Thursday from Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. That could push the average price for a home in Canada as high as $649,400 (about US$533,000), a 14 per cent rise from last year. Low interest rates, combined with a demand for more space to ride out the pandemic, have pushed the Canadian housing market to extraordinary heights over the past year, with annual price gains of more than 30 per cent seen in some communities. With vaccine distribution accelerating and the economy recovering quicker than expected, some of the drivers of the frenzy may begin to unwind. “Economic conditions are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023, if broad immunity to COVID-19 takes hold by the end of 2021,” Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist, said in a statement included in the report. “This includes the pace of home sales and prices, which we expect to see moderate from 2020 highs over the same period.” With faster economic growth, CMHC predicts Canada’s standard five-year mortgage rate will rise, though it will likely stay at very low levels by historical standards. Unusually high savings rates -- driven by people having less opportunity to spend during the pandemic -- are expected to fall, the agency said. The higher demand for single-family homes brought on by intermittent lockdowns, meanwhile, will cause developers and construction companies to shift in that direction, CMHC predicted. Renewed immigration will bring demand for rental accommodation back to cities that have seen vacancies rise and rents fall. Amid this confluence of factors, CMHC predicts the number of homes sold across Canada in 2022 and 2023 will be less than this year, though still more than the number sold in 2019. Prices are expected to keep on rising, with the average price going as high as $704,900 by the end of 2023, the CMHC report said.

More Video Investing Technology News Wire Apr 28, 2021 Bitcoin is facing a make-or-break moment: technical analysis Vildana Hajric and Lu Wang, Bloomberg News Not surprising if we end the year with Bitcoin through 100,000: BlockTower Capital's Bucella VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} Bitcoin is facing a make-or-break moment following a recent bout of selling, according to technical analysis. Though the cryptocurrency has rebounded above its average price over the past 100 days, it’s still trading below its 50-day moving average. Such a dynamic typically indicates an asset is nearing an inflection point. If Bitcoin can’t overtake its 50-day mean -- which currently sits at about US$57,000 -- then it might be in for a period of volatility as the gap between the two trend lines converges. Technical indicators suggest breaking out might not be an easy feat -- Bitcoin failed to do so on several occasions last week. Trading in the world’s largest digital asset has been choppy in recent days after it hit a record high in mid-April above US$64,000. It’s down more than 15 per cent since then, though it rebounded earlier this week amid positive news, including comments from Tesla Inc.’s chief financial officer that reiterated the company’s commitment to the cryptocurrency. “The drastic -- relative to what we’ve seen of late -- pullback certainly was a point of eyebrows being raised, but at the end of the day, I think the fact that things were able to rebound and stabilize is a good thing,” said David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. “It shows real power to the token, the staying power to the asset class.” The coin fell 1.4 per cent on Wednesday following an announcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will delay a decision on a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. It was at about US$54,586 as of 9:43 a.m. in Hong Kong Thursday. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, says that if the stock market continues its advance, he expected Bitcoin to follow. Despite its recent turbulence, Bitcoin is still up 511 per cent over the past year. Inflation and central bank policies have been its biggest drivers during the past 12 months, according to Quant Insight, a London-based analytics research firm that studies the relationship between assets and macro factors. While some dispute the idea that Bitcoin can act as an inflation hedge, the argument has been a key tenet for its bullish thesis and rings true for a lot of crypto fans. Proponents have seized on the money-printing narrative to promote the notion that Bitcoin is a store of wealth, an explanation that’s gained traction in recent months with economists expecting price pressures to pick up. “No question about it -- what drives a big chunk of the interest in Bitcoin has been just the tremendous amount of money that has been printed and will be printed and really the fundamental thought that you cannot have that much money in the system and not have it be inflationary,” said Chuck Cumello, president and chief executive officer of Essex Financial Services.

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Company News May 13, 2021 Greyhound Canada to cut all routes, end operations Brett Bundale, The Canadian Press Greyhound Canada permanently cutting bus routes across the country VIDEO SIGN OUT Greyhound Canada is permanently cutting all bus routes across the country, shutting down the intercity bus carrier's operations in Canada after nearly a century of service. The motor coach company said its remaining routes in Ontario and Quebec will cease permanently on Thursday. Its American affiliate, Greyhound Lines, Inc., will continue to operate cross-border routes to Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver once the border reopens. The decision comes a year after Greyhound Canada temporarily suspended all service due to a sharp decline in passengers and mounting travel restrictions amid the first wave of COVID-19. The bus carrier has struggled for years with declining ridership, increasing competition and deregulation. But the complete loss of so-called farebox revenue during the pandemic has forced the company to permanently cease operations, said Greyhound Canada senior vice-president Stuart Kendrick. “It's been a very tough decision and one we've taken with a heavy heart,” he told The Canadian Press in an interview. “It's been a lifeline for many Canadians for more than 90 years. This will have a massive impact.” The decision is a blow to rural and remote areas that rely on a patchwork of private intercity bus companies for transportation. The service has long been part of a network linking smaller communities and big cities, offering an affordable and convenient mode of travel for everyone from essential workers and students to the elderly and backpackers. Yet the rise in car ownership, ride sharing, discount airlines and urban migration has slowly eroded bus ridership, leading Greyhound Canada to gradually reduce the frequency of some services and cut other routes altogether. “Private carriers are relying on the farebox revenue to maintain these rural routes,” Kendrick said. “When ridership declines, we have a decision to make. We either cut the frequency, exit the rural markets or look for some help.” Citing declining ridership, deregulation and subsidized competition, Greyhound Canada suspended all operations in Western Canada in 2018. Yet despite the ongoing challenges with its remaining routes, nothing could have prepared the company for the dramatic 95 per cent drop in passengers at the outset of the pandemic, Kendrick said. Multiple coach bus companies teamed up and approached the federal and provincial governments for financial aid amid mounting COVID-19 restrictions. But Kendrick said they were referred to existing pandemic supports - what he called “negligible” for the beleaguered passenger transportation industry - prompting Greyhound Canada to temporarily suspend all service last May. “There's really been a lack of support,” Kendrick said. “We don't get subsidies.” Intercity bus carriers are also competing with publicly funded train and transit systems, he said, putting private companies at a disadvantage. The Ontario government has also promised to deregulate the intercommunity bus industry starting in July, a move that would end Greyhound Canada's control of certain routes. “We have had exclusive private bus service on certain corridors,” he said, noting that it provided passengers with safe, frequent and affordable service. “Greyhound Canada's tough decision today is going to have a massive impact on customers, especially those riding in the rural network.” About 260 employees were laid off after Greyhound Canada temporarily ended its passenger service last May. An additional 45 employees will be laid off as a result of the permanent closure, Kendrick said. The Amalgamated Transit Union lamented the impact of the shutdown on workers and said it will leave thousands of people without transportation options. “This is devastating news for the thousands of Canadians, especially those from Indigenous and First Nations communities, who have relied on Greyhound for transportation,” said the union's international president, John Costa, in a statement. Greyhound plans to sell the bus stations it owns, Kendrick said. As for its leased properties, some of the agreements have expired or have an “out clause,” while it will honour the terms of leases it's obliged to continue paying, Kendrick said. The company said tickets for travel after Thursday will be refunded. Customers with a valid travel voucher can also request a refund. All Ontario and Quebec routes that were temporarily suspended in May 2020 will permanently end as of midnight on Thursday. The routes are: - Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal - Toronto-London-Windsor - Sudbury-Ottawa/Toronto - Toronto-Kitchener/Guelph/Cambridge - Toronto-Niagara Falls - Ottawa-Kingston Riders across Canada said they were disappointed by Greyhound's closure, such as 68-year-old Robyn Brown, who used to take the Greyhound bus to travel to Toronto when she lived in Niagara Falls, Ont. Now living in Vancouver, Brown has also used Greyhound bus routes to visit friends from smaller towns in British Columbia that aren't serviced by other forms of public transit. Before the pandemic, she and her husband planned to take a Greyhound from Vancouver to Winnipeg to save on travel fare. “I'm really sad to see that it's going, I really am,” she said, adding that she would now fly to Winnipeg or Toronto if she wanted to travel between provinces. Lisa Baril in Calgary said she has childhood memories of taking a Greyhound bus to visit her grandparents in Kelwood, Man. As an adult, Baril said she would pick up her grandmother from the Greyhound station in Calgary whenever she'd visit. “She would say (Greyhound's closure) is a shame,” said Baril about her late grandmother. “She would probably get frustrated and say `well how am I going to see you guys now?”'Michael Clark, 35, from Waterloo, Ont., said that in college, he used to take the Greyhound bus almost every month to visit his parents in Kingston, Ont., from Ottawa. “When I moved back to Kingston, I would take day trips into Toronto on weekends by catching the earliest and latest buses in and out,” he said, adding that he found the train too expensive and the Greyhound bus was an easy direct route for him. He said the closure is “such a horrible loss” for smaller towns in Ontario, where the only way to travel outside the community is by car. The pandemic has had a debilitating impact on Canada's struggling intercity bus industry. Coach bus companies have reduced service frequency or cut routes due to the precipitous drop in ridership, threatening to erode the country's transportation network. In January, senators from the Maritimes sent a letter to federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra urging Ottawa to provide financial assistance to Maritime Bus. The Charlottetown-based company had warned that without funding, it would have to cut routes. The senators said that with Via Rail service suspended and airlines slashing flights to the region, the bus was needed for essential travel, such as transporting blood products or patients to health appointments across the region. In January, the New Brunswick government stepped in to provide $720,000 to the private regional bus operator to maintain service to Edmundston and Campbellton in the province's north.

Canada’s biggest air carrier is in a position to ramp up operations after reaching a deal for nearly $5.9 billion (US$4.8 billion) in debt and equity with the federal government last month. Chief Executive Officer Michael Rousseau said it’s now “essential” for officials to follow the U.S. in easing rules that have stopped most air travel. “Starting with replacing blanket restrictions with science-based testing and limited quarantine measures where appropriate, Canada can reopen and safely ease travel restrictions as vaccination programs roll out,” Rousseau said in a statement accompanying first-quarter results that included an 80 per cent revenue decline from the same period in 2020. “We have seen elsewhere, notably in the U.S., that travel rebounds sharply as COVID-19 recedes and restrictions are lifted, and we fully expect this can be replicated in Canada,” Rousseau said. Canada has barred many foreign nationals from entering the country since last March and requires a two-week quarantine for some arriving travelers -- including a hotel stay at their own cost. Eastern provinces have also adopted restrictions on travelers from other parts of Canada. The hotel quarantine became mandatory earlier this year for passengers awaiting test results, but it’s been undermined by travelers who have opted to pay a fine instead. It “has proven ineffective,” Rousseau said on a call with analysts. “It should be eliminated.” That approach has reduced Canadian air travel to a trickle. Average passenger traffic at the largest Canadian airports’ checkpoints in April was just 8 per cent of 2019 levels, versus 59 per cent in the U.S., where vaccination has proceeded more quickly, according to data from the countries’ transport security authorities. Air Canada says there’s pent-up demand for both leisure and business travel. Conversations with corporate clients suggest a recovery will start in September, Rousseau said. The airline is already seeing solid bookings for warm destinations like Florida and the Caribbean for late 2021 and early 2022, according to Chief Commercial Officer Lucie Guillemette. There’s been an uptick in international travel demand for the summer as well, she said. Air Canada shares were up 2.7 per cent in Toronto at 11:43 a.m. They’re up 15 per cent this year. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has shared no details about when border rules might ease or what the criteria will be for doing so, though at a news conference this week he signaled support for a vaccine passport and raised the possibility that travel might resume this summer. Air Canada doesn’t have any direct sign from the government on what will trigger a reopening but has been having positive discussions, Rousseau said. There’s “a fair amount of work being done behind the scenes,” he said. For now, the country is still grappling with a third wave of infections, and its vaccination campaign is still beset by supply hurdles and confusion. About 30 per cent of Canadians have received a first dose, compared with 45 per cent in the U.S. and 52 per cent in the U.K, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. But fewer than 3 per cent in Canada are fully vaccinated. Montreal-based Air Canada, which ramped up cargo shipments during the crisis, reported operating revenue that beat analysts’ estimates. Still, it expects capacity in the second quarter to be 84 per cent lower than the 2019 level. During the quarter, it burned about $14 million a day on average, less than the $15 million to $17 million it had expected. It forecasted about the same for the current quarter, with a range of $13 million to $15 million a day, and indicated that there would be no meaningful improvements.

The number of homes to change hands could climb as high as 602,300 this year from about 550,000 sales seen last year, according to a report released Thursday from Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. That could push the average price for a home in Canada as high as $649,400 (about US$533,000), a 14 per cent rise from last year. Low interest rates, combined with a demand for more space to ride out the pandemic, have pushed the Canadian housing market to extraordinary heights over the past year, with annual price gains of more than 30 per cent seen in some communities. With vaccine distribution accelerating and the economy recovering quicker than expected, some of the drivers of the frenzy may begin to unwind. “Economic conditions are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023, if broad immunity to COVID-19 takes hold by the end of 2021,” Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist, said in a statement included in the report. “This includes the pace of home sales and prices, which we expect to see moderate from 2020 highs over the same period.” With faster economic growth, CMHC predicts Canada’s standard five-year mortgage rate will rise, though it will likely stay at very low levels by historical standards. Unusually high savings rates -- driven by people having less opportunity to spend during the pandemic -- are expected to fall, the agency said. The higher demand for single-family homes brought on by intermittent lockdowns, meanwhile, will cause developers and construction companies to shift in that direction, CMHC predicted. Renewed immigration will bring demand for rental accommodation back to cities that have seen vacancies rise and rents fall. Amid this confluence of factors, CMHC predicts the number of homes sold across Canada in 2022 and 2023 will be less than this year, though still more than the number sold in 2019. Prices are expected to keep on rising, with the average price going as high as $704,900 by the end of 2023, the CMHC report said.

Commodities Economics Canada News Wire May 17, 2021 Commodities send loonie soaring, creating quandary for Canada Theophilos Argitis, Bloomberg News Loonie surge is in line with the current strength in real assets: Purpose Financial CEO VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} The broad rally in raw materials that’s lifted prices for crops, energy and metals is a bonanza for Canada’s economy and a major challenge for the nation’s policy makers, who are under pressure to ensure that everybody benefits. Should the commodities boom hold, it would represent a windfall for the resource-rich nation endowed with oil, natural gas and vast lands to mine and farm. Export receipts are already at near a record and poised to go higher. The value of lumber shipments alone nearly doubled in the first quarter. But Canada’s economy is already brimming with stimulus and may hit full capacity as early as this year, according to some economists. Elevated commodity prices are driving up the currency and longer-term rates, potentially crowding out other key sectors that may struggle to compete under a stronger Canadian dollar. The loonie is the best-performing major currency this year and is near a six-year high. Five-year bond yields are the highest in the Group of 10. That means policy makers could face pressure to slow development, curb capital inflows and stem foreign exchange gains, as is usually the case in Canada when commodities boom. While this sort of pressure has been brushed off in the past, it will be more difficult to ignore today amid what appears to be a shift in macroeconomic policy. In their pandemic-recovery plans, global policy makers are emphasizing not only growth and income but also how the fruits of the recovery are distributed and whether some people are being left behind. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem frequently uses the terms “complete recovery” and “shared recovery.” In practice, that means trying to run the economy as hot as possible without fueling inflation too much. The issue becomes more acute if a commodity boom heats up the economy but exacerbates disparities. A jump in resource prices in Canada creates sharp regional differences in who benefits and who loses. For example, soaring prices for lumber, grain and oil are great for western Canada, the country’s breadbasket and the source of more than 90 per cent of its crude production. The higher costs, rates and currency that come with it are harder on the manufacturing sector, based in Ontario, and on cities. One out of every two jobs still not replaced from the pandemic are in Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. Low-wage workers, women and youth have been hit hardest. Yet, these regions and groups probably won’t benefit directly from any strong resource-driven recovery. For Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, the challenge is profound. Resource production is energy-intensive, which may hinder the government’s ability to meet its ambitious climate change targets by 2030. There are political considerations for Trudeau, who has thin support in the rural and western parts of Canada where resources drive the economy. The recent emphasis on securing manufacturing supply chains and promoting domestic industry will only heighten sensitivity to the long-term costs of losing industrial capacity because of a higher currency. But Canada’s economic history shows it’s difficult to say no to commodity riches. Higher government revenue would help offset record budget deficits, and policy makers are desperate for underlying growth drivers beyond more government stimulus. A rally in oil prices helped Canada emerge from the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, according to Lisa Raitt, Canada’s natural resource minister at the time. Raitt expects policy policy makers to try to ensure that the economic effects of resource extraction will be more broad-based. “There is a much more smarter approach that governments are going to be taking from a policy point of view, ensuring that the manufacturing part goes with the mining part,” Raitt said in a phone interview. Canada has reserves of lithium and other metals needed in batteries for electric vehicles, for example, and Trudeau’s government and its provincial counterpart in Ontario have offered large subsidies to automakers including Ford Motor Co. to bring EV production to their Canadian plants. Of course, the commodity boom could prove to be short-lived. Up to now, the issue has been under the federal government’s radar. In her first budget speech last month, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland made little mention of the sector despite the rally in resource prices -- an indication that perhaps they don’t see it as a lasting trend. That’s consistent with expectations of many economic policy makers across the world -- including at the Bank of Canada -- who see an inflation spike and any prolonged surge in demand for commodities as largely temporary. “I don’t think of it as a true commodity supercycle,” Stephen Poloz, Macklem’s predecessor as Bank of Canada governor, said in an interview, referring to economic cycles in which prices remain well above long-term trends for years. “I’m not predicting the roaring ’20s here -- rather a good, solid resumption, and if it’s well managed it will be long lasting.” But even if there’s no supercycle, the run-up will produce ongoing windfalls for the Canadian economy as long as prices don’t decline. As a share of total exports, shipments of basic materials and commodities are at the highest levels since 2014, before the collapse of global oil prices. “That can only be a good thing for Canada,” Poloz said.

Senior officials have begun to formally talk about options for how to proceed, three people familiar with the matter said, speaking on the condition they not be identified. One question under consideration is whether to employ a two-track system in which quarantine and testing requirements would be relaxed for vaccinated travelers. The world’s longest international border has been shuttered since March 2020 to most non-essential travel, dramatically reducing land and air traffic between the two countries. The restrictions have hit the nation’s tourism and airline sectors particularly hard -- one estimate says the measures cost those industries about C$20 billion ($16.5 billion) in revenue last year. “In the end, it’s a political decision, and at what point does the Canadian side -- and it’s the Canadian side at this point that’s the slowpoke -- decide that they’re ready to receive and what categories of people that they’ll open up to,” Michael Kergin, a former Canadian ambassador to the U.S., said in a phone interview. “A staged reopening would be the logical approach.” Any reopening of the border would be gradual and contingent on declining cases in both countries, the officials said. The third wave of the pandemic has hit the northern nation harder because of a vaccine rollout that’s been slowed by supply issues and shipment delays. Many Canadian provinces remain in extended lockdowns even as the country has ramped up its vaccination campaign. A reopening of the border probably isn’t imminent, and the discussions in the government are just getting started, the officials said. According to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker, 34.1% of Canadians residents have received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and only 2.7% are fully inoculated, compared with 46.6% and 35.8%, respectively, in the U.S. Trudeau has said that most Canadians aren’t likely to be fully vaccinated until September. Harmonized One challenge is coming up with an approach, in coordination with the U.S., to verify vaccination documentation. Trudeau has said Canada is open to vaccine passports, which are electronic documents that would allow countries to verify whether travelers have been inoculated. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, by contrast, has ruled them out. That will leave companies and other institutions like colleges to determine their own rules. “It would make sense for us to align with partners around the world on some sort of proof of vaccination or vaccine certification,” Trudeau said at a May 4 news conference. “We are looking very carefully at it, hoping to align with allied countries, but I can’t speak for the United States and the choices they might make around who to welcome into their country.” Canada has said it’s working with the European Union to align their approaches. The EU is already pushing ahead with plans to end internal travel restrictions for vaccinated individuals. “The problem is we have an asymmetrical situation here,” Kergin said, referring to the vaccination disparity between Canada and the U.S. Related Air Canada pleads with Trudeau for plan to ease travel rules Canadians still deeply wary about allowing U.S. visitors: Poll Quarantines crushing air travel are getting longer and lonelier Politics 7:28 Trudeau ministers start laying out metrics for reopening border 7:28 G-20 leaders pledge money, vaccines to counter COVID tensions 3:43 Trudeau visa lures nearly 6,000 Hong Kongers amid China feud Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

More Video Most Popular Content {{item.title | formatTitle}} Company News May 13, 2021 Greyhound Canada to cut all routes, end operations Brett Bundale, The Canadian Press Greyhound Canada permanently cutting bus routes across the country VIDEO SIGN OUT Greyhound Canada is permanently cutting all bus routes across the country, shutting down the intercity bus carrier's operations in Canada after nearly a century of service. The motor coach company said its remaining routes in Ontario and Quebec will cease permanently on Thursday. Its American affiliate, Greyhound Lines, Inc., will continue to operate cross-border routes to Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver once the border reopens. The decision comes a year after Greyhound Canada temporarily suspended all service due to a sharp decline in passengers and mounting travel restrictions amid the first wave of COVID-19. The bus carrier has struggled for years with declining ridership, increasing competition and deregulation. But the complete loss of so-called farebox revenue during the pandemic has forced the company to permanently cease operations, said Greyhound Canada senior vice-president Stuart Kendrick. “It's been a very tough decision and one we've taken with a heavy heart,” he told The Canadian Press in an interview. “It's been a lifeline for many Canadians for more than 90 years. This will have a massive impact.” The decision is a blow to rural and remote areas that rely on a patchwork of private intercity bus companies for transportation. The service has long been part of a network linking smaller communities and big cities, offering an affordable and convenient mode of travel for everyone from essential workers and students to the elderly and backpackers. Yet the rise in car ownership, ride sharing, discount airlines and urban migration has slowly eroded bus ridership, leading Greyhound Canada to gradually reduce the frequency of some services and cut other routes altogether. “Private carriers are relying on the farebox revenue to maintain these rural routes,” Kendrick said. “When ridership declines, we have a decision to make. We either cut the frequency, exit the rural markets or look for some help.” Citing declining ridership, deregulation and subsidized competition, Greyhound Canada suspended all operations in Western Canada in 2018. Yet despite the ongoing challenges with its remaining routes, nothing could have prepared the company for the dramatic 95 per cent drop in passengers at the outset of the pandemic, Kendrick said. Multiple coach bus companies teamed up and approached the federal and provincial governments for financial aid amid mounting COVID-19 restrictions. But Kendrick said they were referred to existing pandemic supports - what he called “negligible” for the beleaguered passenger transportation industry - prompting Greyhound Canada to temporarily suspend all service last May. “There's really been a lack of support,” Kendrick said. “We don't get subsidies.” Intercity bus carriers are also competing with publicly funded train and transit systems, he said, putting private companies at a disadvantage. The Ontario government has also promised to deregulate the intercommunity bus industry starting in July, a move that would end Greyhound Canada's control of certain routes. “We have had exclusive private bus service on certain corridors,” he said, noting that it provided passengers with safe, frequent and affordable service. “Greyhound Canada's tough decision today is going to have a massive impact on customers, especially those riding in the rural network.” About 260 employees were laid off after Greyhound Canada temporarily ended its passenger service last May. An additional 45 employees will be laid off as a result of the permanent closure, Kendrick said. The Amalgamated Transit Union lamented the impact of the shutdown on workers and said it will leave thousands of people without transportation options. “This is devastating news for the thousands of Canadians, especially those from Indigenous and First Nations communities, who have relied on Greyhound for transportation,” said the union's international president, John Costa, in a statement. Greyhound plans to sell the bus stations it owns, Kendrick said. As for its leased properties, some of the agreements have expired or have an “out clause,” while it will honour the terms of leases it's obliged to continue paying, Kendrick said. The company said tickets for travel after Thursday will be refunded. Customers with a valid travel voucher can also request a refund. All Ontario and Quebec routes that were temporarily suspended in May 2020 will permanently end as of midnight on Thursday. The routes are: - Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal - Toronto-London-Windsor - Sudbury-Ottawa/Toronto - Toronto-Kitchener/Guelph/Cambridge - Toronto-Niagara Falls - Ottawa-Kingston Riders across Canada said they were disappointed by Greyhound's closure, such as 68-year-old Robyn Brown, who used to take the Greyhound bus to travel to Toronto when she lived in Niagara Falls, Ont. Now living in Vancouver, Brown has also used Greyhound bus routes to visit friends from smaller towns in British Columbia that aren't serviced by other forms of public transit. Before the pandemic, she and her husband planned to take a Greyhound from Vancouver to Winnipeg to save on travel fare. “I'm really sad to see that it's going, I really am,” she said, adding that she would now fly to Winnipeg or Toronto if she wanted to travel between provinces. Lisa Baril in Calgary said she has childhood memories of taking a Greyhound bus to visit her grandparents in Kelwood, Man. As an adult, Baril said she would pick up her grandmother from the Greyhound station in Calgary whenever she'd visit. “She would say (Greyhound's closure) is a shame,” said Baril about her late grandmother. “She would probably get frustrated and say `well how am I going to see you guys now?”'Michael Clark, 35, from Waterloo, Ont., said that in college, he used to take the Greyhound bus almost every month to visit his parents in Kingston, Ont., from Ottawa. “When I moved back to Kingston, I would take day trips into Toronto on weekends by catching the earliest and latest buses in and out,” he said, adding that he found the train too expensive and the Greyhound bus was an easy direct route for him. He said the closure is “such a horrible loss” for smaller towns in Ontario, where the only way to travel outside the community is by car. The pandemic has had a debilitating impact on Canada's struggling intercity bus industry. Coach bus companies have reduced service frequency or cut routes due to the precipitous drop in ridership, threatening to erode the country's transportation network. In January, senators from the Maritimes sent a letter to federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra urging Ottawa to provide financial assistance to Maritime Bus. The Charlottetown-based company had warned that without funding, it would have to cut routes. The senators said that with Via Rail service suspended and airlines slashing flights to the region, the bus was needed for essential travel, such as transporting blood products or patients to health appointments across the region. In January, the New Brunswick government stepped in to provide $720,000 to the private regional bus operator to maintain service to Edmundston and Campbellton in the province's north.

After a year of stockpiling record amounts of capital to protect against a wave of loan defaults, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank -- the country’s two largest banks -- reversed course last quarter. Toronto-Dominion on Thursday reported a surprise $377 million (US$312 million) release of provisions for credit losses for its fiscal second quarter, while Royal Bank released $96 million. Analysts had projected both lenders would continue setting aside capital to absorb potentially soured loans. With vaccination campaigns putting economic reopenings in reach in Canada and the U.S., strong housing markets fueling mortgage lending, and surging equity markets supporting capital-markets and wealth-management businesses, Toronto-Dominion and Royal Bank are asserting they have more than enough capital to handle any bumps along the road to recovery. BANK EARNINGS RBC beats as investment bankers, credit quality drive profit surge CIBC Q2 profit beats as provisions plunge, mortgage book grows BMO beats Q2 profit estimates as loan-loss provisions plunge Even after reporting smaller set-asides than analysts expected in the fiscal first quarter, bank executives still struck a cautious tone on their preparations for potential credit losses, leading many analysts to expect reserve releases wouldn’t begin until the second half of the year. “They definitely are a lot more positive than they were three months ago,” Paul Gulberg, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview Thursday. “It’s a combination of vaccines and a stronger economy -- not just in the U.S. and Canada -- but an improving economy globally.” While the reserve releases were the banks’ first in data going back to 2012, key measures of capital on hand for Royal Bank and Toronto-Dominion continued to rise. Royal Bank’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio increased to 12.8 per cent in the three months through April from 12.5 per cent in the first quarter. Toronto-Dominion’s CET1 rose to 14.2 per cent from 13.6 per cent. Those rising measures may put pressure on Canada’s bank regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, to allow the country’s banks to resume share buybacks and dividend increases. The U.S. Federal Reserve allowed American banks to resume buybacks last year. “OSFI should be looking into it,” Gulberg said. “Dividend increases, which have been locked for over a year, and some buybacks could bring capital ratios back to more normal, more palatable levels for the banks.” The comeback from the pandemic made its way to banks’ bottom lines. At Royal Bank, net income rose 171 per cent to $4.02 billion in the second quarter. Excluding some items, profit was $2.79 a share, topping analysts’ $2.51 average estimate. Toronto-Dominion’s net income more than doubled to $3.7 billion, and adjusted earnings totaled $2.04 a share, beating analysts’ $1.76 estimate. The rebound in earnings is a big part of why Toronto-Dominion was able to release some of its provisions, and progress on vaccine rollouts and healthy economic-growth forecasts leave the bank poised for continued strong performance in the U.S. and Canada, Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said. ‘Very encouraged’ “We’re very encouraged by those developments in Canada, and some of the announcements that are coming out of the various provinces about what the next three to four months will look like,” Ahmed said in an interview. While the high level of deposits that have built up over the past year present challenges for growth in credit-card balances and commercial loans, a number of factors are lining up that could overcome those headwinds, Royal Bank Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said. “You have strong GDP growth, strong customer demand, building confidence levels and also a desire to work through some of the global supply-chain issues and potentially build inventory where many places have no inventory,” Bolger said in a phone interview. “Those should be constructive for overall loan growth.” Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce also reported second-quarter results Thursday. Its net income quadrupled to $1.65 billion, and adjusted profit was $3.59 a share, higher than the $3 average estimate. CIBC shares rose as much as in 3.6 per cent in Toronto trading, its biggest intraday gain since November. Royal Bank advanced 1.4 per cent as of 3:22 p.m., and Toronto-Dominion slipped 2.1 per cent. CIBC’s results were driven by gains in its Canadian banking franchise, with increases in mortgages and deposits. CFO Hratch Panossian said revitalizing the Canadian consumer business has been the No. 1 priority for the bank. “There has been lots of management attention, investment and focus that has gone into that,” he said in an interview. “We’re pleased to see some of that paying dividends.” Related CIBC Q2 profit beats as provisions plunge, mortgage book grows RBC beats as investment bankers, credit quality drive profit surge TD Bank flush with cash as second-quarter profit surges 144% Top Picks 4:54 Eric Nuttall's Top Picks: May 28, 2021 4:35 Lorne Steinberg's Top Picks: May 27, 2021 3:54 Kevin Burkett's Top Picks: May 26, 2021 Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Up to one quarter of hours worked could be remote after the health crisis ends, Statistics Canada said Wednesday in new calculations based on survey data. That’s up from about 5 per cent pre-pandemic, the agency said. The figure for university-educated workers is 44 per cent, versus 9 per cent for those with no post-secondary education. The new estimates point to a sustained shift in potential working arrangements that could have far-reaching implications for everything from housing markets to traffic congestion and climate change, Statistics Canada said. “One sector that will struggle for a long time will be core urban area commercial real estate,” Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Securities Inc., said by email. “Fewer people on any given day in core urban areas will also obviously have implications for small businesses located in these areas.” To come up with its estimates, the study used survey data from February that showed 80 per cent of Canadians who began working remote during the pandemic would like to work at least half their hours from home in a post-COVID world. In addition to education, there are also divides when it comes to gender. Women could see as much as 28 per cent of hours worked from home, compared with 22 per cent for men. In February, 31 per cent of hours worked were done from home, according to the report.

Commodities News Wire Company News Investing May 25, 2021 U.S. seeks trade-pact dispute panel to probe Canada dairy quotas Ana Monteiro, Bloomberg News Dairy is always the last issue we agree on: Trade lawyer on Canada-U.S. dairy dispute VIDEO SIGN OUT The U.S. moved to set up a dispute-settlement panel to review Canada’s dairy quotas, which Washington alleges undermine the ability of American dairy exporters to sell a wide range of products to Canadian consumers. The U.S. is challenging Canada’s tariff-rate quotas, or TRQs, which apply a preferential duty rate to a certain quantity of imports and a different rate to imports above that quantity. Specifically, the U.S. is questioning the set-aside of a percentage of each dairy quota exclusively for Canadian processors, and the U.S. has requested a panel under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to review the measures, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in a statement Tuesday. “These measures deny the ability of U.S. dairy farmers, workers, and exporters to utilize the TRQs and realize the full benefit of the USMCA,” the USTR said. “Launching the first panel request under the agreement will ensure our dairy industry and its workers can seize new opportunities under the USMCA to market and sell U.S. products to Canadian consumers.” The U.S. dairy industry has long pushed for greater accountability by its northern neighbor, part of the impetus for including dairy policy in the July pact that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. Under the USMCA, Canada has the right to maintain 14 TRQs on dairy products including milk, cream, and yogurt. Canada disappointed Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng said the nation is “disappointed” with the U.S.’s request for a dispute panel. “Under CUSMA, Canada agreed to provide some additional market access to the United States for dairy while successfully defending our supply management system and dairy industry,” she said in a statement, using Canada’s acronym for the trade pact. “We are confident that our policies are in full compliance with our CUSMA TRQ obligations, and we will vigorously defend our position during the dispute-settlement process.” Canada’s dairy industry said its quotas are in line with the trade agreement, and the government has a solid case to present to the panel, said Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada. The Dairy Processors Association of Canada is confident its policies are in full compliance with its obligations, and it’s ready to support the Canadian government defending its position, it said in an email. Panel process The U.S. first challenged the quota in December. Washington held consultations with Ottawa but the parties weren’t able to resolve their concerns through that approach, a USTR official said during a call with reporters. A panel-selection process will take about a month, and a report should be ready later this year, the USTR said. The U.S. Commerce Department’s International Trade Commission has done an initial analysis on the cost of the TRQs to the U.S. dairy industry, but the USTR didn’t disclose the figure, saying this will be under discussion during the implementation phases of arbitration, should the U.S. be successful. The agreement does provide for the possibility tariffs as a form of retaliation, but “we’re a long way from that process,” the USTR official said. Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department issued new preliminary rulings on antidumping tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber imports that would double the current duties if implemented. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked about these trade tensions in lumber and dairy earlier Tuesday at a press conference in Ottawa. “We will always stand up for our forestry workers and the industry across the country. We will continue -- as we did successfully in the previous administration -- to stand up to defend Canadian interests and values wherever necessary and that will continue,” Trudeau said.

The cost of housing has risen across the country driven by a mix of low interest rates and demand outstripping supply as Canadians working from home look for more space. Trudeau says the result is that the cost of owning a home is too far out of reach for too many people in Canada's largest cities, noting it can take 280 months for an average family to save for a down payment in a place like Toronto. Speaking to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities today, Trudeau says his government would look for ways to change the situation beyond what the Liberals have already laid out. He notes the federal government alone can't cool housing costs, saying the levers exist at all levels of government. Trudeau says the Liberals will reach out to provinces and territories to find solutions to ease concerns around housing affordability.

More Video Investing May 31, 2021 High-flying tech stocks could 'collapse,' Jarislowsky warns Ian Vandaelle, BNN Bloomberg Inflation-proof investing: Legendary investor Jarislowsky stands by non-cyclical sectors VIDEO SIGN OUT Legendary investor Stephen Jarislowsky is warning investors may want to stay away from the high-flying tech stocks. In a television interview Monday, Jarislowsky, the founder and former chairman of Jarislowsky Fraser, said the outperformance of the tech sector since the start of the pandemic could eventually end in tears. “Short-term, I would say that in high-tech and speculative growth stocks, there could very well be a collapse at some point, because that has been bought by the gamblers,” he said. Though the rally in the so-called FAANG stocks – Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent company Alphabet Inc. – has eased amid inflationary fears, the group remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Rather than chasing the hot tech sector, Jarislowsky said he favours more staid names that can benefit from long-term trends. “In the States, the defense industry is perfectly adequate. In the U.S., I would say most of the big health care stocks are at reasonable prices. I would say that the oil stocks in Canada could go up materially,” he said. Ultimately, Jarislowsky said he’s confident the overall equity markets will perform well for the foreseeable future as central banks across the world keep interest rates at the effective lower bound. “These rates are here to say until such time that a solution has been found to raise interest rates without damaging the economy and putting it back in the sewer,” he said. “As long as that happens, I think we are going to be okay with the stock market, because there are very few alternatives.” Related Rising rates could trigger 'massive' mortgage default: Jarislowsky The options market may be fueling the turbulence in tech shares Tech rout is a reminder of danger behind rich valuations Top Picks 4:35 David Baskin's Top Picks: June 4, 2021 5:45 Brian Madden's Top Picks: June 3, 2021 4:30 Shane Obata's Top Picks: June 2, 2021 Top Stories Economics 6:02 Canada suffers second labour market setback ahead of reopening Canada’s labor market weakened for a second month amid widespread restrictions to control a third wave of COVID-19.

After a year of stockpiling record amounts of capital to protect against a wave of loan defaults, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank -- the country’s two largest banks -- reversed course last quarter. Toronto-Dominion on Thursday reported a surprise $377 million (US$312 million) release of provisions for credit losses for its fiscal second quarter, while Royal Bank released $96 million. Analysts had projected both lenders would continue setting aside capital to absorb potentially soured loans. With vaccination campaigns putting economic reopenings in reach in Canada and the U.S., strong housing markets fueling mortgage lending, and surging equity markets supporting capital-markets and wealth-management businesses, Toronto-Dominion and Royal Bank are asserting they have more than enough capital to handle any bumps along the road to recovery. BANK EARNINGS RBC beats as investment bankers, credit quality drive profit surge CIBC Q2 profit beats as provisions plunge, mortgage book grows BMO beats Q2 profit estimates as loan-loss provisions plunge Even after reporting smaller set-asides than analysts expected in the fiscal first quarter, bank executives still struck a cautious tone on their preparations for potential credit losses, leading many analysts to expect reserve releases wouldn’t begin until the second half of the year. “They definitely are a lot more positive than they were three months ago,” Paul Gulberg, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview Thursday. “It’s a combination of vaccines and a stronger economy -- not just in the U.S. and Canada -- but an improving economy globally.” While the reserve releases were the banks’ first in data going back to 2012, key measures of capital on hand for Royal Bank and Toronto-Dominion continued to rise. Royal Bank’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio increased to 12.8 per cent in the three months through April from 12.5 per cent in the first quarter. Toronto-Dominion’s CET1 rose to 14.2 per cent from 13.6 per cent. Those rising measures may put pressure on Canada’s bank regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, to allow the country’s banks to resume share buybacks and dividend increases. The U.S. Federal Reserve allowed American banks to resume buybacks last year. “OSFI should be looking into it,” Gulberg said. “Dividend increases, which have been locked for over a year, and some buybacks could bring capital ratios back to more normal, more palatable levels for the banks.” The comeback from the pandemic made its way to banks’ bottom lines. At Royal Bank, net income rose 171 per cent to $4.02 billion in the second quarter. Excluding some items, profit was $2.79 a share, topping analysts’ $2.51 average estimate. Toronto-Dominion’s net income more than doubled to $3.7 billion, and adjusted earnings totaled $2.04 a share, beating analysts’ $1.76 estimate. The rebound in earnings is a big part of why Toronto-Dominion was able to release some of its provisions, and progress on vaccine rollouts and healthy economic-growth forecasts leave the bank poised for continued strong performance in the U.S. and Canada, Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said. ‘Very encouraged’ “We’re very encouraged by those developments in Canada, and some of the announcements that are coming out of the various provinces about what the next three to four months will look like,” Ahmed said in an interview. While the high level of deposits that have built up over the past year present challenges for growth in credit-card balances and commercial loans, a number of factors are lining up that could overcome those headwinds, Royal Bank Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said. “You have strong GDP growth, strong customer demand, building confidence levels and also a desire to work through some of the global supply-chain issues and potentially build inventory where many places have no inventory,” Bolger said in a phone interview. “Those should be constructive for overall loan growth.” Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce also reported second-quarter results Thursday. Its net income quadrupled to $1.65 billion, and adjusted profit was $3.59 a share, higher than the $3 average estimate. CIBC shares rose as much as in 3.6 per cent in Toronto trading, its biggest intraday gain since November. Royal Bank advanced 1.4 per cent as of 3:22 p.m., and Toronto-Dominion slipped 2.1 per cent. CIBC’s results were driven by gains in its Canadian banking franchise, with increases in mortgages and deposits. CFO Hratch Panossian said revitalizing the Canadian consumer business has been the No. 1 priority for the bank. “There has been lots of management attention, investment and focus that has gone into that,” he said in an interview. “We’re pleased to see some of that paying dividends.” Related CIBC Q2 profit beats as provisions plunge, mortgage book grows RBC beats as investment bankers, credit quality drive profit surge TD Bank flush with cash as second-quarter profit surges 144% Top Picks 4:35 David Baskin's Top Picks: June 4, 2021 5:45 Brian Madden's Top Picks: June 3, 2021 4:30 Shane Obata's Top Picks: June 2, 2021 Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Spending more time at home also allowed many people to narrow in on what was truly important to them in a home: more space. “Why the heck are we living in this shoebox?"" Erinn Bourassa, a family wills and estate lawyer, and her partner Tony found themselves working from their roughly 675-square-foot rental apartment in Toronto during the pandemic and quickly realized that they needed more room. They ended up buying a cottage near Lake Simcoe, about an hour drive north of Toronto, and moved in June 2020. She said the price was “dirt cheap” at $330,000 – and the mortgage payment was cheaper than what they were paying in rent for their apartment. “When it started to look like working from home was going to be more long term, we asked ourselves why the heck are we living in this shoebox in the middle of downtown when we could see what else is out there,” she said in a phone interview. Remote work capabilities have opened up new living possibilities for many Canadians; and suddenly, small towns across the country have found themselves engulfed in a housing boom usually reserved for major cities. I'm going to change the Einstein definition of insanity to this: when home prices in North Bay, Ontario begin to look like a dotcom stock in 1999. There's a whole lot of pain, globally speaking, if (when) this housing bubble bursts. pic.twitter.com/NTR4H2Z7WT — David Rosenberg (@EconguyRosie) June 4, 2021 Data from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board show detached home sales in the suburbs, or the 905 area code as locals refer to it, outpaced sales in Toronto in all but two months since June 2020. Bracing for back to work Now, with vaccination rates accelerating across the country and economic reopenings on the horizon or already underway in some provinces, those who moved out of urban cores might have to start commuting back into city for all or some of the work week. Finance manager Miguel Bolivar says he and his partner don’t regret their decision to leave Toronto and move to Hamilton, Ont. in December after being priced out of the Toronto housing market. “When I got my first corporate job in 2015, I was commuting from Hamilton to Toronto every day and it was brutal,” he wrote in an email. “But now that I’m expecting to commute two or three times a week and I own a home, it’s definitely worth it!” Bourassa says she knew there would be an eventual return to the office, so she sat down with her employer to discuss what the in-office expectations would be post-pandemic before she purchased the home up north. “Luckily, my employer is very easy going and supportive, and they’re happy with me coming downtown two to three days a week. I don’t feel a lot of pressure to come in. I think it’s a good balance – I can work from home and work in the office. Commuting a couple days a week is not so bad for me.” A recent poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies found eight in ten respondents said their work-from-home experience was very or somewhat positive. It also found only one fifth wanted to return to the office on a full-time basis. Employers who choose to shift to a hybrid model have many considerations including how to balance being flexible while ensuring the fabric of their workforce remains strong and dynamic. Michael Cooper, the chief executive of office space provider Dream Office Real Estate Investment Trust, told BNN Bloomberg last month that most of his company’s tenants are maintaining or renewing their leases and that the majority of the conversations business leaders are having with Dream Office are transitional in nature for employees’ return to the office. Make-or-break decisions Like Bolivar, human resources supervisor Cassandra Twyne began working remotely full-time from her Toronto east-end apartment during the pandemic and bought a house in Hamilton earlier this year. She understood the risks she was taking if her employer wanted to call her back into her Toronto-based office full-time, and made sure that she’d be able to work from home in a hybrid model in the future. “If I was going to be moving that far away, I wouldn’t be going into the office five days a week. It’s not an option for me. I would go mental trying to work in the office. It’s a four-hour commute,” she said. “That’s a lot of time every week.” A mandated full-time return to the office means she’d leave her current position. “As long as I’m living in Hamilton and working in Toronto I would need some sort of hybrid or else I’d be forced to find something else,” she said. “I’d either find something local or find another job that has the flexibility of working from home. I know that’s a reality for me because I’ve seen job postings,” Twyne added. “The first question I’ll ask anyone is, ‘Does this have work-from-home capabilities?’, because that’s a reality of the decision I made in moving so far away.” An opportunity in the fight for talent Meanwhile, Bolivar believes the ability to work from home at least some of the time will become the norm for most companies post-pandemic. “My opinion is that employers that offer [work from home] will be marketing it as a benefit similar to how companies currently market their great health/dental packages, pension plans, stock options,” he wrote. “Employers that offer [work from home] will have a distinct advantage and attract the best talent.” For Bourassa, she’s enjoying the new reality of her work and living situation. “I’m so accustomed to the flexibility of this new world, I think I’d be less attracted to working for a company that didn’t have a work-from-home capability,” she said. “Overall, I love [my home] and feel happier overall because of how much time we spend in nature and our proximity to the lake.” Related Employees are quitting instead of giving up working from home Office demand will be 'off to the races' after COVID restrictions: Dream Office World's vaccine trailblazer shows what return to office will look like Sweats to impress: How the pandemic is shaking up office wear Top Stories 8:09 Canadians' net worth surges on housing but renters left behind 7:51 Toronto bankers dodge Wall Street's return-to-office pressure 7:15 Employers put to the test on work-from-home post-COVID Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

The nation’s population rose by 0.2 per cent, or 82,366 people, in the first three months of this year to 38.1 million, according to quarterly estimates released Thursday by Statistics Canada. That’s the fastest quarterly population growth since the pandemic hit, and reflects a rebound in international migration. Quarterly growth averaged just under 0.3 per cent in the decade before the pandemic. The numbers suggest the nation is finding ways to allow workers and students to enter the country despite travel restrictions. Immigration into Canada has been a key driver of of economic growth, having an impact on everything from the housing market to banking services. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has prioritized immigration despite the economic downturn, seeing it as necessary to counter the impact of aging demographics on the labor force. This year, the government is targeting 401,000 permanent residents to make up for missing its 2020 goal, hoping to put more non-Canadians already living in the country on the path to citizenship. Net international migration -- which also includes non-permanent residents like students -- was the biggest contributor to population growth in the first quarter, with 75,987 new entrants. That’s been about the recent average for the first three months of a year. “We’re starting to see a strong rebound of study permit visas,” Andrew Agopsowicz, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said by email. That pace also appears to have continued into the second quarter, according to the latest data from Immigration Canada that show the country accepted 91,580 permanent residents in the first four months of 2021. In 2020, population growth fell to its slowest since World War I as the country halted nearly all travel to curb the spread of COVID-19. But the government has adjusted its immigration and travel guidelines to ensure that newcomers including students and close relatives can enter. Canada has had its border closed to non-essential travel for nearly 15 months. From a year ago, population is up just 0.4 per cent. That’s unchanged from the year-over-year pace at end of last year that is the weakest in data going back to the 1940s. The country’s natural increase, or births minus deaths, remained historically low in the first quarter, with a gain of only 6,379. That’s the smallest amount in records dating back to 1946 and reflects aging demographics and low fertility rates, something that other developed countries are struggling with.

The net worth of the nation’s households increased by about $770 billion (US$633 billion) in the first three months of 2021, a record 6 per cent gain, to $13.7 trillion, Statistics Canada said in a report Friday. Since the start of 2020, that figure has increased by more than $2 trillion, largely thanks to rising home prices. But the data also show that windfalls are going largely to homeowners and older Canadians. Households that own their home accounted for almost all of the gains in the first quarter -- $730 billion. The wealth of renters was up just $43 billion. That disparity also comes as rising home values make owning increasingly out of reach for many Canadians. “The numbers speak to exacerbating wealth inequalities, because we also know that it is becoming even more difficult for renters to get into the housing market,” Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Securities, said by email. “The financial burden of owning a property is now untenable for many.” Household net worth spiked 21.5 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the largest gain in records to 1990. That’s more than triple the historical average of 6.8 per cent yearly gains. Those with a major earner 55 or older held $1.1 million in net worth at the start of the year, versus $260,000 for households whose primary breadwinner was under 35, the agency said. The further widening of the wealth gap from housing could feed demands for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other levels of government to tackle housing affordability issues. “Policy makers need to focus on ways to increase housing supply and make it more affordable,” Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said by email. National net worth --- which includes government and corporate wealth -- jumped by over $1 trillion, reaching $15 trillion at the end of the first quarter. “The growth of financial assets has not kept pace with that of real estate, resulting in a higher concentration of wealth in non-financial assets,” Statistics Canada said in the report.

Spending more time at home also allowed many people to narrow in on what was truly important to them in a home: more space. “Why the heck are we living in this shoebox?"" Erinn Bourassa, a family wills and estate lawyer, and her partner Tony found themselves working from their roughly 675-square-foot rental apartment in Toronto during the pandemic and quickly realized that they needed more room. They ended up buying a cottage near Lake Simcoe, about an hour drive north of Toronto, and moved in June 2020. She said the price was “dirt cheap” at $330,000 – and the mortgage payment was cheaper than what they were paying in rent for their apartment. “When it started to look like working from home was going to be more long term, we asked ourselves why the heck are we living in this shoebox in the middle of downtown when we could see what else is out there,” she said in a phone interview. Remote work capabilities have opened up new living possibilities for many Canadians; and suddenly, small towns across the country have found themselves engulfed in a housing boom usually reserved for major cities. I'm going to change the Einstein definition of insanity to this: when home prices in North Bay, Ontario begin to look like a dotcom stock in 1999. There's a whole lot of pain, globally speaking, if (when) this housing bubble bursts. pic.twitter.com/NTR4H2Z7WT — David Rosenberg (@EconguyRosie) June 4, 2021 Data from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board show detached home sales in the suburbs, or the 905 area code as locals refer to it, outpaced sales in Toronto in all but two months since June 2020. Bracing for back to work Now, with vaccination rates accelerating across the country and economic reopenings on the horizon or already underway in some provinces, those who moved out of urban cores might have to start commuting back into city for all or some of the work week. Finance manager Miguel Bolivar says he and his partner don’t regret their decision to leave Toronto and move to Hamilton, Ont. in December after being priced out of the Toronto housing market. “When I got my first corporate job in 2015, I was commuting from Hamilton to Toronto every day and it was brutal,” he wrote in an email. “But now that I’m expecting to commute two or three times a week and I own a home, it’s definitely worth it!” Bourassa says she knew there would be an eventual return to the office, so she sat down with her employer to discuss what the in-office expectations would be post-pandemic before she purchased the home up north. “Luckily, my employer is very easy going and supportive, and they’re happy with me coming downtown two to three days a week. I don’t feel a lot of pressure to come in. I think it’s a good balance – I can work from home and work in the office. Commuting a couple days a week is not so bad for me.” A recent poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies found eight in ten respondents said their work-from-home experience was very or somewhat positive. It also found only one fifth wanted to return to the office on a full-time basis. Employers who choose to shift to a hybrid model have many considerations including how to balance being flexible while ensuring the fabric of their workforce remains strong and dynamic. Michael Cooper, the chief executive of office space provider Dream Office Real Estate Investment Trust, told BNN Bloomberg last month that most of his company’s tenants are maintaining or renewing their leases and that the majority of the conversations business leaders are having with Dream Office are transitional in nature for employees’ return to the office. Make-or-break decisions Like Bolivar, human resources supervisor Cassandra Twyne began working remotely full-time from her Toronto east-end apartment during the pandemic and bought a house in Hamilton earlier this year. She understood the risks she was taking if her employer wanted to call her back into her Toronto-based office full-time, and made sure that she’d be able to work from home in a hybrid model in the future. “If I was going to be moving that far away, I wouldn’t be going into the office five days a week. It’s not an option for me. I would go mental trying to work in the office. It’s a four-hour commute,” she said. “That’s a lot of time every week.” A mandated full-time return to the office means she’d leave her current position. “As long as I’m living in Hamilton and working in Toronto I would need some sort of hybrid or else I’d be forced to find something else,” she said. “I’d either find something local or find another job that has the flexibility of working from home. I know that’s a reality for me because I’ve seen job postings,” Twyne added. “The first question I’ll ask anyone is, ‘Does this have work-from-home capabilities?’, because that’s a reality of the decision I made in moving so far away.” An opportunity in the fight for talent Meanwhile, Bolivar believes the ability to work from home at least some of the time will become the norm for most companies post-pandemic. “My opinion is that employers that offer [work from home] will be marketing it as a benefit similar to how companies currently market their great health/dental packages, pension plans, stock options,” he wrote. “Employers that offer [work from home] will have a distinct advantage and attract the best talent.” For Bourassa, she’s enjoying the new reality of her work and living situation. “I’m so accustomed to the flexibility of this new world, I think I’d be less attracted to working for a company that didn’t have a work-from-home capability,” she said. “Overall, I love [my home] and feel happier overall because of how much time we spend in nature and our proximity to the lake.” Related Employees are quitting instead of giving up working from home Office demand will be 'off to the races' after COVID restrictions: Dream Office World's vaccine trailblazer shows what return to office will look like Sweats to impress: How the pandemic is shaking up office wear Top Stories 8:09 Canadians' net worth surges on housing but renters left behind 7:51 Toronto bankers dodge Wall Street's return-to-office pressure 7:15 Employers put to the test on work-from-home post-COVID Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Polls suggest the incumbent Liberals have seen a boost in popularity due to their response to the coronavirus pandemic that could parlay into a majority government. Vaccination rates are climbing fast, allowing for looser public health restrictions, and the economy is rebounding. Speculation is that an election could be called as early as August, with a vote in September or October. For Trudeau, a majority win would heal the reputational wound of his near-defeat in 2019 and allow him to become one of Canada’s longest-serving prime ministers, along with his late father, Pierre Trudeau. Since losing his majority two years ago, Trudeau has needed the help of other parties to pass legislation, allowing the opposition vast leeway to set the agenda and harangue him over ethics. That’s a far cry from his first mandate, where the Liberals held a comfortable majority and Trudeau was heralded as an antidote to Donald Trump’s style of politics -- a comparison that helped him domestically. Joe Biden lauded the prime minister as one of the last global progressive leaders standing on the eve of Trump’s inauguration. “They want to have a majority so that they don’t have to be answerable to pesky opposition parties,” Anne McGrath, national director of the left-leaning New Democratic Party, said in a telephone interview. “They want full control.” POLLING EDGE The Liberals have the support of 37 per cent of Canadians, according to an Abacus Data poll released Thursday, with the Conservatives at 27 per cent and the NDP at 18 per cent. In addition to a double-digit lead on party preference, approval ratings for both the government and Trudeau personally are higher than they were at the start of the 2019 election campaign. Impressions of his main rival are lower and voters are showing less desire for change, according to Abacus. Those sort of numbers put Trudeau on the cusp of a majority, with the 49-year-old prime minister clearly benefiting from what has been regarded as successful management of the COVID-19 crisis. After a slow start plagued by delays and confusion, Canada’s vaccination campaign is accelerating rapidly toward the milestone of 75 per cent fully vaccinated, which could allow for the opening of the U.S. border and the resumption of travel. Though the economy hasn’t yet made up all the jobs lost to the pandemic, growth is exceeding expectations, thanks in part to a hot housing market, and consumer confidence has soared. CAMPAIGN PREP Trudeau maintains he doesn’t want an election. But in discussing his government’s efforts this week to pass key legislation, the prime minister signaled his frustration with opposition parties, particularly the Conservatives under new leader Erin O’Toole. “We have seen a level of obstructionism and toxicity in the House that is of real concern,” he said Tuesday. The past month saw a series of farewell speeches from Liberal lawmakers who don’t intend to run again, allowing the party to begin nominating new candidates. Trudeau’s team has scheduled a platform workshop session with business groups and industry associations, according a person familiar with the plans. To be sure, calling an election could backfire. “It’s always tricky in the summer because you can annoy people if you get in their faces,” John Manley, a former Liberal deputy prime minister, said by phone. “Especially this summer, people are going to say: ‘Enough with politics. Leave me alone.’” Campaigns matter in Canada. Trudeau himself went from third place to power in 2015, when voters decided it was time for a change after nearly a decade of Conservative rule under Stephen Harper. And last time, the prime minister’s re-election bid was almost derailed entirely by revelations Trudeau wore blackface make-up on multiple occasions as a younger man. This time, the Liberals are hoping their stewardship of the economy through COVID-19 and ambitious spending plans for the recovery are enough to win back control. They’ve been tailoring specific policies to help make that happen, with a focus on the vote-rich, French-speaking province of Quebec. REGIONAL DYNAMICS “There’s no doubt that the Liberals’ path to majority runs through Quebec,” according to pollster David Coletto, chief executive at Abacus. A bill to regulate streaming and social media that the government managed to pass before the summer break is popular in the province, where cultural protection is paramount. Trudeau’s support for the Quebec premier’s effort to strengthen French-language rights will also help the Liberals compete for votes against the separatist Bloc Quebecois. In Ontario -- home to 121 of the 338 seats in Canada’s legislature, 76 of them already Liberal -- Trudeau will likely try to use perceptions that Doug Ford’s provincial government mishandled the pandemic against the federal Conservatives. And in British Columbia, the Liberals are hoping their climate-change agenda will take support away from the NDP and the Green Party. “They’re going where the seats are,” McGrath said. “What they’re banking on is that people will feel more optimistic by the end of the summer, and that will be good for them.” Related Canada races toward key milestone for border opening Trudeau's party passes bill to regulate social media, streaming Trudeau resists business pressure to open U.S. border for summer Politics 9:51 Trudeau eyes summer election to strengthen his grip on power 3:59 EU rejects Merkel-Macron call for leaders' talks with Putin 8:58 Ottawa names CDIC CEO Peter Routledge to head OSFI Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

The federal government still advises against non-essential travel -- either by land or by air -- to U.S. and international destinations, and the land border closure was recently extended to July 21. By and large, the public has complied. However, tales abound of questionable cross-border jaunts by some, including a few politicians, who continued to fly throughout the pandemic. Quarantine requirements upon return have been a deterrent, but that hurdle lifts July 5 for travellers fully vaccinated with a Health Canada-authorized vaccine. A negative COVID-19 test is still required before entry regardless of vaccination status, and travellers must be fully vaccinated for at least two weeks before they re-enter Canada. Stephen Fine, who runs a resource website for Canadian seniors who spend winters in southern U.S. states, said quarantine requirements held back many from booking trips. ""Now that that's gone, the disincentive for people to go down to the U.S. is negated quite a bit,"" said Fine, president of Snowboard Advisor. The new rules only apply to fully vaccinated people. Those with partial protection or none at all still must quarantine when they return to Canada. Sandra Pappas, a Toronto-based travel agent who specializes in booking family vacations in Florida, said that means things get trickier when unvaccinated children are involved, and she's already heard clients express confusion and frustration over the rules. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children arriving by air with fully vaccinated parents won't have to go to quarantine hotels -- federal Health Minister Patty Hadju said Monday they can stay home for two weeks, but must also take a second COVID-19 test on their eighth day of isolation. The same rules apply for unvaccinated children crossing the land border. ""It's frustrating for us because we book a lot of Disney (vacations) and families go to Disney,"" Pappas said. ""So it's not as good for families because, yeah, they can travel ... but with (unvaccinated) children, they still have to do the 14-day quarantine."" Health Canada authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 last month. Moderna's approval for the same age group is pending, but no COVID-19 vaccine is yet authorized for kids younger than 12. Pappas said parents may have to rethink booking a trip if it means they'll have to take extra time off work to watch their quarantining children after their vacations. ""That could throw a wrench in their plans,"" she said. ""I don't see people as receptive to travelling if they book a week at Disney and it ends up costing them three weeks instead of one."" Fully vaccinated travellers still need to submit a negative COVID-19 test before entering the country, be asymptomatic and have a ""suitable quarantine plan ... in case it is determined at the border that they do not meet the necessary requirements,"" the government's website says. Travellers must upload their pre-arrival test and vaccination status to the ArriveCAN app, and carry digital or paper proof of their vaccination status to show border agents. Falsifying vaccination documents can result in a $750,000 fine, up to six months in jail, or both. Pappas said that while air travel has generally been more lenient than crossing by land, it's still up to U.S. customs to determine who they let into their country. Families looking to travel for leisure should make sure they know the potential COVID-19 regulations of their destination. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Canada's website lists reasons for essential travel as: work, study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care and safety and security. While Canada isn't outright forbidding travel for non-essential purposes, the country strongly advises against it. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that he understands the ""impatience people have to get travelling again. But keeping Canadians safe has been and will continue to be our No. 1 priority."" Trudeau said potential loosening of further restrictions could depend on COVID-19 case counts and the prevalence of variants of concern in Canada and elsewhere. There is risk in contracting COVID-19 through travel, even for fully vaccinated individuals, though the effectiveness of the jabs mean a severe infection is less likely. Still, some experts have said it's possible a vaccinated person could still spread the virus. Fine said people will have to weigh their own risk tolerance when booking a trip. ""You're probably going to see a significant increase in people travelling come July,"" he said. ""But there are people who may choose to wait longer to see if we keep heading in the right direction.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has begun citing a 75 per cent two-dose vaccination rate as the threshold to lift border restrictions. That number is about 20 per cent now. As wide as that gap is, the latest vaccine delivery schedule suggests it could close considerably within the next month, raising the prospect that Canada could move ahead with a comprehensive reopening before the end of the critical summer tourism season. Procurement Minister Anita Anand, in a June 15 interview on The Bridge podcast, said the share of Canadians fully vaccinated against COVID-19 could hit 80 per cent by the end of July. (A spokesperson for Anand clarified Wednesday that the minister meant 80 per cent of those eligible for the vaccines could potentially get one by then, based only on projected supplies.) Trevor Tombe, a University of Calgary economics professor who monitors the data, said there’s a better than 50 per cent chance that Canada will reach that threshold in that timeframe. ""I would bet some money on it,"" Tombe said in a phone interview. However, to achieve the government’s goal, Canada will have to significantly increase its current rate of under 500,000 jabs a day. Going Slow Up to now, the Trudeau government’s cautious approach to the U.S. border has drawn condemnation from business groups and expatriates for being overly strict at a time when cases are plunging. The border has been closed to most travel since March 2020, and last week the governments extended the restrictions until at least July 21. The rules have kept families apart, shut out tourists and students, and crimped the U.S.-Canada trading relationship, among the world’s largest. Although trucks and trains continued to move goods, Canada’s travel-related businesses lost an estimated $20 billion (US$16 billion) in revenue last year, according to one estimate. Tombe said his latest projections have the country meeting the 75 per cent threshold on Aug. 5, but new information on vaccine supply suggests that forecast could be ""very conservative,"" he said. That includes 11 million additional Moderna Inc. shots Trudeau and Anand announced Friday. Canada’s decision to mix and match vaccines, including the shot from AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, is also helping it ramp up. At a news conference on Tuesday, the prime minister said vaccination rates weren’t the only factor the government was considering. Officials, he said, are also factoring in the prevalence of variants and overall COVID-19 case counts in Canada and abroad. He said the situation was quickly improving. ""We’re doing things gradually, but we’re talking about weeks and not months anymore,"" Trudeau said, referring to the gradual reopening of the border. Another wild card could be vaccine hesitancy, which appears to be less of a factor in Canada than it is elsewhere. More than 25 million Canadians, or two-thirds of the population, had received one dose as of Tuesday, according to the COVID-19 Tracker Canada website, which combines federal and provincial data. That includes 7.8 million who have received two doses, for a total of about 33 million doses administered so far. To reach the 75 per cent threshold for full vaccination -- equal to 28.5 million people -- the country would need to administer another 24 million doses. That would require picking up the pace considerably. At the current rate of about 432,000 doses a day, Canada would be about 8 million jabs short of 75 per cent full vaccination by July 31. Growing vaccine supply will help close the gap, as long as there isn’t too much vaccine hesitancy. ""If we encounter the U.S. problem whereby willing arms are trailing off then it could conceivably be later,"" Derek Holt, an economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by email. According to Holt, Canada could reach the 75 per cent threshold as early as the middle of July or as late as mid-August, depending on whether demand trails off. Trudeau, at his news conference, acknowledged the urgency of opening the border. ""Everyone wants to get back to a more normal summer,"" he said. --With assistance from Shelly Hagan.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has launched more than 1,500 satellites so far and has Starlink operations in about a dozen countries, Musk said during a presentation at the Mobile World Congress conference. That’s costing a lot. SpaceX’s total investment in the network will be between US$5 billion and US$10 billion before cash flow is positive, he said. “We recently passed the strategically notable number of 69,420 active users,” Musk joked. “We’re I think on our way to having a few hundred thousand users, possibly over 500,000 users within 12 months.” SpaceX aims to offer broadband to as much as 5 per cent of the world’s population where conventional fiber and wireless networks can’t reach. Musk said he’s signed two deals with “major country” telecom operators but he couldn’t name them yet, and he’s in discussions with more. Starlink will provide so-called “data back haul” spines for their networks. The satellite network currently moves about 30 terabits of data per second, and Musk said he’s targeting a user latency -- or network response time -- of less than 20 milliseconds. Musk, who turned 50 on Monday, discussed several additional upgrades in the works during an update on the US$74 billion SpaceX business. The company is set to launch a new version of Starlink’s satellites next year that will have inter-satellite laser links to help them cover polar regions. Its engineers are developing a new ground terminal to stem losses: the dishes customers are currently installing on rooftops cost more than US$1,000 to make but only retail for half that, he said. SpaceX is also planning an orbital flight of its giant Starship rocket “in the next few months” he said.

Polls suggest the incumbent Liberals have seen a boost in popularity due to their response to the coronavirus pandemic that could parlay into a majority government. Vaccination rates are climbing fast, allowing for looser public health restrictions, and the economy is rebounding. Speculation is that an election could be called as early as August, with a vote in September or October. For Trudeau, a majority win would heal the reputational wound of his near-defeat in 2019 and allow him to become one of Canada’s longest-serving prime ministers, along with his late father, Pierre Trudeau. Since losing his majority two years ago, Trudeau has needed the help of other parties to pass legislation, allowing the opposition vast leeway to set the agenda and harangue him over ethics. That’s a far cry from his first mandate, where the Liberals held a comfortable majority and Trudeau was heralded as an antidote to Donald Trump’s style of politics -- a comparison that helped him domestically. Joe Biden lauded the prime minister as one of the last global progressive leaders standing on the eve of Trump’s inauguration. “They want to have a majority so that they don’t have to be answerable to pesky opposition parties,” Anne McGrath, national director of the left-leaning New Democratic Party, said in a telephone interview. “They want full control.” POLLING EDGE The Liberals have the support of 37 per cent of Canadians, according to an Abacus Data poll released Thursday, with the Conservatives at 27 per cent and the NDP at 18 per cent. In addition to a double-digit lead on party preference, approval ratings for both the government and Trudeau personally are higher than they were at the start of the 2019 election campaign. Impressions of his main rival are lower and voters are showing less desire for change, according to Abacus. Those sort of numbers put Trudeau on the cusp of a majority, with the 49-year-old prime minister clearly benefiting from what has been regarded as successful management of the COVID-19 crisis. After a slow start plagued by delays and confusion, Canada’s vaccination campaign is accelerating rapidly toward the milestone of 75 per cent fully vaccinated, which could allow for the opening of the U.S. border and the resumption of travel. Though the economy hasn’t yet made up all the jobs lost to the pandemic, growth is exceeding expectations, thanks in part to a hot housing market, and consumer confidence has soared. CAMPAIGN PREP Trudeau maintains he doesn’t want an election. But in discussing his government’s efforts this week to pass key legislation, the prime minister signaled his frustration with opposition parties, particularly the Conservatives under new leader Erin O’Toole. “We have seen a level of obstructionism and toxicity in the House that is of real concern,” he said Tuesday. The past month saw a series of farewell speeches from Liberal lawmakers who don’t intend to run again, allowing the party to begin nominating new candidates. Trudeau’s team has scheduled a platform workshop session with business groups and industry associations, according a person familiar with the plans. To be sure, calling an election could backfire. “It’s always tricky in the summer because you can annoy people if you get in their faces,” John Manley, a former Liberal deputy prime minister, said by phone. “Especially this summer, people are going to say: ‘Enough with politics. Leave me alone.’” Campaigns matter in Canada. Trudeau himself went from third place to power in 2015, when voters decided it was time for a change after nearly a decade of Conservative rule under Stephen Harper. And last time, the prime minister’s re-election bid was almost derailed entirely by revelations Trudeau wore blackface make-up on multiple occasions as a younger man. This time, the Liberals are hoping their stewardship of the economy through COVID-19 and ambitious spending plans for the recovery are enough to win back control. They’ve been tailoring specific policies to help make that happen, with a focus on the vote-rich, French-speaking province of Quebec. REGIONAL DYNAMICS “There’s no doubt that the Liberals’ path to majority runs through Quebec,” according to pollster David Coletto, chief executive at Abacus. A bill to regulate streaming and social media that the government managed to pass before the summer break is popular in the province, where cultural protection is paramount. Trudeau’s support for the Quebec premier’s effort to strengthen French-language rights will also help the Liberals compete for votes against the separatist Bloc Quebecois. In Ontario -- home to 121 of the 338 seats in Canada’s legislature, 76 of them already Liberal -- Trudeau will likely try to use perceptions that Doug Ford’s provincial government mishandled the pandemic against the federal Conservatives. And in British Columbia, the Liberals are hoping their climate-change agenda will take support away from the NDP and the Green Party. “They’re going where the seats are,” McGrath said. “What they’re banking on is that people will feel more optimistic by the end of the summer, and that will be good for them.” Related Canada races toward key milestone for border opening Trudeau's party passes bill to regulate social media, streaming Trudeau resists business pressure to open U.S. border for summer Politics 7:48 Habs' surprising run lifts the mood in virus hot spot 6:13 Final figures from 2020-21 show Alberta with $17B deficit 7:26 Canadians consider U.S. a far better economic partner than China, Pew survey suggests Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

The federal government still advises against non-essential travel -- either by land or by air -- to U.S. and international destinations, and the land border closure was recently extended to July 21. By and large, the public has complied. However, tales abound of questionable cross-border jaunts by some, including a few politicians, who continued to fly throughout the pandemic. Quarantine requirements upon return have been a deterrent, but that hurdle lifts July 5 for travellers fully vaccinated with a Health Canada-authorized vaccine. A negative COVID-19 test is still required before entry regardless of vaccination status, and travellers must be fully vaccinated for at least two weeks before they re-enter Canada. Stephen Fine, who runs a resource website for Canadian seniors who spend winters in southern U.S. states, said quarantine requirements held back many from booking trips. ""Now that that's gone, the disincentive for people to go down to the U.S. is negated quite a bit,"" said Fine, president of Snowboard Advisor. The new rules only apply to fully vaccinated people. Those with partial protection or none at all still must quarantine when they return to Canada. Sandra Pappas, a Toronto-based travel agent who specializes in booking family vacations in Florida, said that means things get trickier when unvaccinated children are involved, and she's already heard clients express confusion and frustration over the rules. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children arriving by air with fully vaccinated parents won't have to go to quarantine hotels -- federal Health Minister Patty Hadju said Monday they can stay home for two weeks, but must also take a second COVID-19 test on their eighth day of isolation. The same rules apply for unvaccinated children crossing the land border. ""It's frustrating for us because we book a lot of Disney (vacations) and families go to Disney,"" Pappas said. ""So it's not as good for families because, yeah, they can travel ... but with (unvaccinated) children, they still have to do the 14-day quarantine."" Health Canada authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 last month. Moderna's approval for the same age group is pending, but no COVID-19 vaccine is yet authorized for kids younger than 12. Pappas said parents may have to rethink booking a trip if it means they'll have to take extra time off work to watch their quarantining children after their vacations. ""That could throw a wrench in their plans,"" she said. ""I don't see people as receptive to travelling if they book a week at Disney and it ends up costing them three weeks instead of one."" Fully vaccinated travellers still need to submit a negative COVID-19 test before entering the country, be asymptomatic and have a ""suitable quarantine plan ... in case it is determined at the border that they do not meet the necessary requirements,"" the government's website says. Travellers must upload their pre-arrival test and vaccination status to the ArriveCAN app, and carry digital or paper proof of their vaccination status to show border agents. Falsifying vaccination documents can result in a $750,000 fine, up to six months in jail, or both. Pappas said that while air travel has generally been more lenient than crossing by land, it's still up to U.S. customs to determine who they let into their country. Families looking to travel for leisure should make sure they know the potential COVID-19 regulations of their destination. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Canada's website lists reasons for essential travel as: work, study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care and safety and security. While Canada isn't outright forbidding travel for non-essential purposes, the country strongly advises against it. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that he understands the ""impatience people have to get travelling again. But keeping Canadians safe has been and will continue to be our No. 1 priority."" Trudeau said potential loosening of further restrictions could depend on COVID-19 case counts and the prevalence of variants of concern in Canada and elsewhere. There is risk in contracting COVID-19 through travel, even for fully vaccinated individuals, though the effectiveness of the jabs mean a severe infection is less likely. Still, some experts have said it's possible a vaccinated person could still spread the virus. Fine said people will have to weigh their own risk tolerance when booking a trip. ""You're probably going to see a significant increase in people travelling come July,"" he said. ""But there are people who may choose to wait longer to see if we keep heading in the right direction.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has begun citing a 75 per cent two-dose vaccination rate as the threshold to lift border restrictions. That number is about 20 per cent now. As wide as that gap is, the latest vaccine delivery schedule suggests it could close considerably within the next month, raising the prospect that Canada could move ahead with a comprehensive reopening before the end of the critical summer tourism season. Procurement Minister Anita Anand, in a June 15 interview on The Bridge podcast, said the share of Canadians fully vaccinated against COVID-19 could hit 80 per cent by the end of July. (A spokesperson for Anand clarified Wednesday that the minister meant 80 per cent of those eligible for the vaccines could potentially get one by then, based only on projected supplies.) Trevor Tombe, a University of Calgary economics professor who monitors the data, said there’s a better than 50 per cent chance that Canada will reach that threshold in that timeframe. ""I would bet some money on it,"" Tombe said in a phone interview. However, to achieve the government’s goal, Canada will have to significantly increase its current rate of under 500,000 jabs a day. Going Slow Up to now, the Trudeau government’s cautious approach to the U.S. border has drawn condemnation from business groups and expatriates for being overly strict at a time when cases are plunging. The border has been closed to most travel since March 2020, and last week the governments extended the restrictions until at least July 21. The rules have kept families apart, shut out tourists and students, and crimped the U.S.-Canada trading relationship, among the world’s largest. Although trucks and trains continued to move goods, Canada’s travel-related businesses lost an estimated $20 billion (US$16 billion) in revenue last year, according to one estimate. Tombe said his latest projections have the country meeting the 75 per cent threshold on Aug. 5, but new information on vaccine supply suggests that forecast could be ""very conservative,"" he said. That includes 11 million additional Moderna Inc. shots Trudeau and Anand announced Friday. Canada’s decision to mix and match vaccines, including the shot from AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, is also helping it ramp up. At a news conference on Tuesday, the prime minister said vaccination rates weren’t the only factor the government was considering. Officials, he said, are also factoring in the prevalence of variants and overall COVID-19 case counts in Canada and abroad. He said the situation was quickly improving. ""We’re doing things gradually, but we’re talking about weeks and not months anymore,"" Trudeau said, referring to the gradual reopening of the border. Another wild card could be vaccine hesitancy, which appears to be less of a factor in Canada than it is elsewhere. More than 25 million Canadians, or two-thirds of the population, had received one dose as of Tuesday, according to the COVID-19 Tracker Canada website, which combines federal and provincial data. That includes 7.8 million who have received two doses, for a total of about 33 million doses administered so far. To reach the 75 per cent threshold for full vaccination -- equal to 28.5 million people -- the country would need to administer another 24 million doses. That would require picking up the pace considerably. At the current rate of about 432,000 doses a day, Canada would be about 8 million jabs short of 75 per cent full vaccination by July 31. Growing vaccine supply will help close the gap, as long as there isn’t too much vaccine hesitancy. ""If we encounter the U.S. problem whereby willing arms are trailing off then it could conceivably be later,"" Derek Holt, an economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by email. According to Holt, Canada could reach the 75 per cent threshold as early as the middle of July or as late as mid-August, depending on whether demand trails off. Trudeau, at his news conference, acknowledged the urgency of opening the border. ""Everyone wants to get back to a more normal summer,"" he said. --With assistance from Shelly Hagan.

More Video Company News Jul 6, 2021 Travel demand to hit pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022: Porter CEO Jon Mace, BNN Bloomberg We expect fairly rapid recovery starting in September: Porter Airlines CEO VIDEO SIGN OUT The head of Toronto-based Porter Airlines has laid out his flight plan for this fall on both sides of the border, but doesn't expect travel demand to return back to pre-pandemic levels until mid-2022. “Over the past month we’ve been getting a lot more reception from customers,” said Michael Deluce, president and chief executive officer at Porter Airlines, in a broadcast interview. “We expect a fairly rapid recovery starting in September. Will it go back to 100 per cent overnight? Absolutely not. But, we anticipate a strong recovery through fall. Hopefully by mid-2022 we’ll see traffic levels that return to pre-pandemic levels.” The carrier announced Monday that it is planning to restart service in early September after a hiatus of more than 16 months. Porter’s entire network is expected to be up and running by Oct. 6, said Deluce. Last month, Porter and the federal government reached an agreement for loans of up to $270 million, with $20.5 million earmarked for passenger refunds for COVID-cancelled flights. “The federal government has stepped up to ensure substantial liquidity as carriers ramp up operations post-pandemic,” said Deluce. He also noted the federal funds will be used by Porter on an as-needed basis. “We went into the pandemic with a very strong balance sheet and raised capital very quickly in March 2020, and maintained a very modest burn rate over the past 16 months.” While awaiting the green light to return to the skies, Porter has been busy upgrading its fleet of 29 turboprop planes, all of which boast new seats, carpets and fresh coats of paint, said Deluce. As demand for air travel remains a moving target, the carrier will have to bring staff back in order to resume service, Deluce added. Prior to the pandemic, Porter had more than 1,400 team members. Today, that number is down to just 200 staff, but the company plans to bring back up to 500 workers between now and September, with more possible later in the fall, said Deluce. Deluce said he expects airfares to be ""volatile"" in the early stages of the recovery as carriers struggle to balance capacity with demand, but figures that will resolve itself over time.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has launched more than 1,500 satellites so far and has Starlink operations in about a dozen countries, Musk said during a presentation at the Mobile World Congress conference. That’s costing a lot. SpaceX’s total investment in the network will be between US$5 billion and US$10 billion before cash flow is positive, he said. “We recently passed the strategically notable number of 69,420 active users,” Musk joked. “We’re I think on our way to having a few hundred thousand users, possibly over 500,000 users within 12 months.” SpaceX aims to offer broadband to as much as 5 per cent of the world’s population where conventional fiber and wireless networks can’t reach. Musk said he’s signed two deals with “major country” telecom operators but he couldn’t name them yet, and he’s in discussions with more. Starlink will provide so-called “data back haul” spines for their networks. The satellite network currently moves about 30 terabits of data per second, and Musk said he’s targeting a user latency -- or network response time -- of less than 20 milliseconds. Musk, who turned 50 on Monday, discussed several additional upgrades in the works during an update on the US$74 billion SpaceX business. The company is set to launch a new version of Starlink’s satellites next year that will have inter-satellite laser links to help them cover polar regions. Its engineers are developing a new ground terminal to stem losses: the dishes customers are currently installing on rooftops cost more than US$1,000 to make but only retail for half that, he said. SpaceX is also planning an orbital flight of its giant Starship rocket “in the next few months” he said.

Step 3 of the province's reopening plan, which took effect just after midnight, allows fitness facilities, cinemas, museums and other venues to reopen indoors after a long shutdown aimed at limiting spread of COVID-19. Indoor restaurant dining also resumes. In Mississauga, Ont., several patrons were seated inside Maggie's Diner by mid-morning, in addition to others on the patio. Owner Sam Aly said the return of indoor service signalled relief after a difficult period for his business. ""I got more customers today than I've gotten all month, so it looks positive,"" Aly said. Ontario's move to Step 3 came days earlier than scheduled thanks to positive trends in COVID-19 vaccination coverage and other public health indicators. Aly said the early move is helpful, as restaurants had been limited to takeout and patio service under the previous step of the plan, limiting revenue especially during several rainy days in the Greater Toronto Area. ""Anything is a bonus for us right now,"" he said. ""Now we can hopefully stand on two feet and try to make some money and try to get out of this debt we're in."" Restaurant dining rooms don't have a set capacity limit as long as people can maintain two metres of distance. Social gatherings are now limited to 25 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. Rules around masking and physical distancing are still in place, with some exceptions. Gym patrons don't need to wear masks inside when using equipment, but most of the small handful of members at one Toronto GoodLife Fitness chain were wearing masks during their workouts on Friday morning. Manager Matt Ariganello said he expects crowds to gradually return over the next few weeks. Premier Doug Ford thanked Ontarians on social media for following public health orders and getting vaccinated during the pandemic. ""I'm confident that there are only brighter days ahead,"" Ford said in a prepared social media video. ""Because of your efforts, we are closer than ever before to returning to normal lives."" He asked people to support local business and continue seeking vaccinations against COVID-19. Ontario reported 159 new COVID-19 cases and 10 deaths from the virus on Friday.

Real Estate Jul 20, 2021 Home prices up 16% in June for largest 12-month gain on record The Canadian Press Toronto's hot housing market cools VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} Canadian home prices increased in June to mark the largest 12-month gain on record as prices climbed in all 11 markets, says the Teranet National Bank composite price index. The index was up 16 per cent from June 2020, beating the 14.2 per cent rise of June 2017 that preceded the introduction of macroprudential measures designed to restrain home prices. Prices were up 10 per cent or more in an unprecedented 90 per cent of 32 urban markets and up 30 per cent or more in 42 per cent of these markets. Halifax led with prices climbing 30.8 per cent over the past year, followed by Hamilton (28 per cent), Ottawa-Gatineau (25.8 per cent), Montreal (19.4 per cent) and Victoria (18.5 per cent). Toronto trailed the countrywide average at 15.9 per cent. The index rose 2.7 per cent from May for the 20th consecutive monthly increase. It was the second-largest monthly gain on record since the index started in 1999, trailing only the 2.8 per cent monthly increase recorded in May. It was also the first monthly deceleration since January, a cooling that coincides with a slowing of growth in sales of existing homes sales, which fell in June for a third straight month. The moderation in the pace of sales could mean a slowing of price rises in the coming months but price decreases aren't expected in the near-term. Ottawa-Gatineau led with a four per cent increase in monthly prices, followed by Hamilton (3.8 per cent), Victoria (3.6 per cent), Halifax (3.5 per cent), Montreal (3.4 per cent), Vancouver (2.7 per cent), Toronto (2.7 per cent), Calgary (1.4 per cent), Winnipeg (1.3 per cent), Quebec City (1.3 per cent) and Edmonton (1.1 per cent).

Step 3 of the province's reopening plan, which took effect just after midnight, allows fitness facilities, cinemas, museums and other venues to reopen indoors after a long shutdown aimed at limiting spread of COVID-19. Indoor restaurant dining also resumes. In Mississauga, Ont., several patrons were seated inside Maggie's Diner by mid-morning, in addition to others on the patio. Owner Sam Aly said the return of indoor service signalled relief after a difficult period for his business. ""I got more customers today than I've gotten all month, so it looks positive,"" Aly said. Ontario's move to Step 3 came days earlier than scheduled thanks to positive trends in COVID-19 vaccination coverage and other public health indicators. Aly said the early move is helpful, as restaurants had been limited to takeout and patio service under the previous step of the plan, limiting revenue especially during several rainy days in the Greater Toronto Area. ""Anything is a bonus for us right now,"" he said. ""Now we can hopefully stand on two feet and try to make some money and try to get out of this debt we're in."" Restaurant dining rooms don't have a set capacity limit as long as people can maintain two metres of distance. Social gatherings are now limited to 25 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. Rules around masking and physical distancing are still in place, with some exceptions. Gym patrons don't need to wear masks inside when using equipment, but most of the small handful of members at one Toronto GoodLife Fitness chain were wearing masks during their workouts on Friday morning. Manager Matt Ariganello said he expects crowds to gradually return over the next few weeks. Premier Doug Ford thanked Ontarians on social media for following public health orders and getting vaccinated during the pandemic. ""I'm confident that there are only brighter days ahead,"" Ford said in a prepared social media video. ""Because of your efforts, we are closer than ever before to returning to normal lives."" He asked people to support local business and continue seeking vaccinations against COVID-19. Ontario reported 159 new COVID-19 cases and 10 deaths from the virus on Friday.

Real Estate Jul 20, 2021 Home prices up 16% in June for largest 12-month gain on record The Canadian Press Toronto's hot housing market cools VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} Canadian home prices increased in June to mark the largest 12-month gain on record as prices climbed in all 11 markets, says the Teranet National Bank composite price index. The index was up 16 per cent from June 2020, beating the 14.2 per cent rise of June 2017 that preceded the introduction of macroprudential measures designed to restrain home prices. Prices were up 10 per cent or more in an unprecedented 90 per cent of 32 urban markets and up 30 per cent or more in 42 per cent of these markets. Halifax led with prices climbing 30.8 per cent over the past year, followed by Hamilton (28 per cent), Ottawa-Gatineau (25.8 per cent), Montreal (19.4 per cent) and Victoria (18.5 per cent). Toronto trailed the countrywide average at 15.9 per cent. The index rose 2.7 per cent from May for the 20th consecutive monthly increase. It was the second-largest monthly gain on record since the index started in 1999, trailing only the 2.8 per cent monthly increase recorded in May. It was also the first monthly deceleration since January, a cooling that coincides with a slowing of growth in sales of existing homes sales, which fell in June for a third straight month. The moderation in the pace of sales could mean a slowing of price rises in the coming months but price decreases aren't expected in the near-term. Ottawa-Gatineau led with a four per cent increase in monthly prices, followed by Hamilton (3.8 per cent), Victoria (3.6 per cent), Halifax (3.5 per cent), Montreal (3.4 per cent), Vancouver (2.7 per cent), Toronto (2.7 per cent), Calgary (1.4 per cent), Winnipeg (1.3 per cent), Quebec City (1.3 per cent) and Edmonton (1.1 per cent).

Commodities Aug 11, 2021 Lumber drops to nine-month low, extending retreat from record Marcy Nicholson, Bloomberg News Lumber prices may be held in check because there’s a slowdown in orders: Prosper Trading Academy CEO VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} Lumber futures slid to the lowest in more than nine months after sawmills ramped up production and demand from builders stabilized. September futures in Chicago fell as much as 4.4 per cent to US$482.90 per thousand board feet, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 30. Prices have dropped more than 70 per cent from the record high reached just three months ago. The tumble marks a stark turnaround for the common building material after strong U.S. construction demand during the pandemic spurred a surge in orders for lumber, causing prices to more than quadruple to their May peak and fueling inflation concerns. Sawmills have since increased output, and a shortage of other building supplies such as siding and windows has slowed the pace of construction, said Brian Leonard, an analyst with RCM Alternatives. “While most of the wood out there today is pegged for a job site, the slowdown keeps it all backed up,” Leonard said. “The industry has to work through that issue before it goes back to the mills to buy. That is forcing the mills to lower prices daily to get rid of prompt wood.” The drop-off in lumber prices has been highlighted by Federal Reserve policy makers looking to reassure markets that a surge in inflation will prove temporary. Even the wildfires in British Columbia, which have forced some sawmills to curtail production, haven’t managed to stem the slide in prices. Lumber has weakened on a sharp drop in do-it-yourself home renovations projects and what is now an over-supplied market relative to demand, said Westline Capital Strategies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Greg Kuta, whose Ohio-based firm specializes in lumber-trading strategies. “Builders don’t need the framing lumber, they need the framing package and that’s easier said than done with supply chain issues with panels, engineered wood, etc.,” Kuta said. “Lumber is just one piece of the building puzzle.” Related Western Forest Products Q2 profit soars to $78.3M on surging lumber prices How to chop remodeling costs when wood prices are high Surging lumber prices boost Canfor Q2 profits and revenues to record highs Pot Shots 8:14 End to banking hassles would be an advantage for us: Pot giant Cresco Labs' CEO 5:22 This U.S. legislation is a game changer: Curaleaf executive chairman 3:09 U.S. democratic senators to unveil draft cannabis reform bill on Wednesday: Report Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

More Video Company News Aug 17, 2021 BHP quits oil, piles into Canadian potash in overhaul for CEO Thomas Biesheuvel and James Thornhill, Bloomberg News Commodities for Tuesday, August 17, 2021 VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} BHP Group unveiled the most sweeping change to its business since the world’s biggest miner was created two decades ago, as it plans an escape away from fossil fuels to shift toward what it calls “future facing” commodities and clears up some longstanding questions facing investors. BHP will sell its oil and gas operations to Woodside Petroleum Ltd. in exchange for shares that it will distribute to its own investors, it announced Tuesday. The company also approved US$5.7 billion of spending to build a massive new fertilizer mine in Canada and said it will unify its dual-listed structure and shift to a single primary listing in Australia. The shares in London jumped as much as 9.8 per cent after the flurry of announcements. Mike Henry, chief executive officer of BHP Group Ltd poses for a photograph at company headquarters Melbourne, Australia, on Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2020. The decisions -- which come alongside record free-cash flow for the year through June and a US$10.1 billion final dividend -- represent a pivotal moment for Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry, who took the helm in January last year. Investors have been waiting years for a decision on Jansen, while the company has said previously its dual listing was up for discussion after coming under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which also pushed for an exit from oil and gas. Since his appointment, Henry has been seeking to focus the company toward metals and minerals that will benefit from global efforts to reduce emissions, electrify cities and feed a growing global population. A Canadian-born executive who joined BHP in 2003 from Mitsubishi Corp., he inherited a business that had been stripped down and simplified under his predecessor, who sold out of shale and spun off unwanted assets, but still faced huge decisions on potash, the listing and the future of fossil fuels. “These are sweeping changes,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital. “The new, improved, not so-boring BHP.” The change to the listing structure means “they can be more nimble in the future,” he said. “It’s not just change today, but it means there’s more change coming tomorrow.” The dual listing dates back to 2001, following Australia-listed BHP’s merger with U.K.-listed Billiton, and had seen the companies managed and run as a single entity with shareholders having equal economic and voting rights. Elliott argued in 2018 that a reorganization into a single company in Australia would add more than US$22 billion in value to shareholders. BHP generates the bulk of its profits from iron ore and copper -- a metal that’s central to the green-energy transition -- and benefited from soaring prices for both commodities over the past year. The company is also trying to sell its thermal coal operations and is expanding in nickel, a vital material in rechargeable batteries. The commodities giant is getting out of oil and gas as the fossil-fuels industry grapples with global pressure from investors and governments over climate action, prompting some larger oil rivals to shrink their core production and add renewable energy assets. While BHP has said it expects demand to remain strong for at least another decade, the company wants to avoid getting stuck with assets that will become more difficult to sell. BHP has also finally approved the first stage of construction of the Jansen potash mine in Saskatchewan, Canada, after years of wavering over the huge price tag. The operation, expected to start production in 2027, will make it one of the world’s top producers of the crop nutrient. “Potash provides BHP with increased leverage to key global mega-trends, including rising population, changing diets, decarbonisation and improving environmental stewardship,” the company said. It’s also the latest sign that the biggest miners are ready to open their wallets to invest in new mines after years of austerity. The industry has been focused on shareholder returns and debt reduction after being penalized by investors. BHP has already spent about US$4.5 billion on Jansen and dug two 1,000-meter (3,300-feet) deep shafts but held off on a final development decision as it weighed the risks of the large investment. Potash prices have jumped this year amid strong demand, as well as worries about supply after Belarus, one of a handful of producing nations, was hit by sanctions. Like its biggest rivals, BHP reported bumper profits and dividends. Commodity prices surged in the past year as governments around the world unleash trillions of dollars in stimulus packages to help the global economy emerge from the pandemic, boosting demand for raw materials.

Beata Caranci, the bank’s chief economist, said her group could cut its fourth-quarter forecasts for Ontario and other provinces that don’t have plans to limit high-risk activities for people who are not vaccinated. That’s because those regions are more likely to resort to lockdowns or other restrictions on business activity. “Provinces who are more proactive in putting in measures that increase confidence in going to restaurants and concerts might do better than provinces who aren’t putting these measures in,” Caranci said by phone. That means Quebec’s economy could outperform Ontario’s because the French-speaking province is implementing a domestic passport system on Sept. 1 that would ban unvaccinated patrons from gyms and bars. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has so far resisted calls to implement a passport system. Vaccine passports could also keep overall confidence high among consumers and businesses, according to Caranci. “Are you taking every means possible to make sure your business stays open during this wave as vaccines buffer against hospitalization risk,” she said. “Those provinces doing that put themselves in a better position than those who don’t.” Besides Quebec, British Columbia will require proof of vaccination starting Sept. 13 for people attending certain social and recreational activities. Oil-rich Alberta has ruled out a vaccine passport while other provinces are still undecided. Nearly 75 per cent of eligible Canadians are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data compiled by CTV News, but rates vary by province.

A new survey from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) indicates this country’s entrepreneurs generally support the use of a COVID-19 vaccine passport in certain settings, but these business owners are less than keen on having to enforce vaccine requirements for their staff and even more so, their customers. Seventy-four per cent of small business owners polled by the CFIB said they support vaccine passports for international travel, while 65 per cent said they support a government-issued passport for events like concerts, festivals and sporting events. Support drops off when it impacts their operations, as only 48 per cent would support a vaccine passport for their staff and only 37 per cent for their customers. That said, support climbs back up to 55 per cent when the issue is framed as an alternative to another lockdown. For this poll the CFIB surveyed nearly 2,800 small business owners the week of Aug. 5. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 per cent 19 times out of 20. The chief practical concern cited by respondents when it comes to the execution of a vaccine policy was the legal risk of checking vaccine credentials. Last week, Canada’s large banks got the ball rolling for the corporate world announcing full vaccine mandates effective this fall. Maple Leafs Sports & Entertainment Ltd., owner of the Toronto Raptors and Toronto Maple Leafs, also recently said fans will need to show proof of vaccination to attend a game for the two teams’ upcoming seasons.

More Video Company News Aug 17, 2021 BHP quits oil, piles into Canadian potash in overhaul for CEO Thomas Biesheuvel and James Thornhill, Bloomberg News Commodities for Tuesday, August 17, 2021 VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} BHP Group unveiled the most sweeping change to its business since the world’s biggest miner was created two decades ago, as it plans an escape away from fossil fuels to shift toward what it calls “future facing” commodities and clears up some longstanding questions facing investors. BHP will sell its oil and gas operations to Woodside Petroleum Ltd. in exchange for shares that it will distribute to its own investors, it announced Tuesday. The company also approved US$5.7 billion of spending to build a massive new fertilizer mine in Canada and said it will unify its dual-listed structure and shift to a single primary listing in Australia. The shares in London jumped as much as 9.8 per cent after the flurry of announcements. Mike Henry, chief executive officer of BHP Group Ltd poses for a photograph at company headquarters Melbourne, Australia, on Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2020. The decisions -- which come alongside record free-cash flow for the year through June and a US$10.1 billion final dividend -- represent a pivotal moment for Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry, who took the helm in January last year. Investors have been waiting years for a decision on Jansen, while the company has said previously its dual listing was up for discussion after coming under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which also pushed for an exit from oil and gas. Since his appointment, Henry has been seeking to focus the company toward metals and minerals that will benefit from global efforts to reduce emissions, electrify cities and feed a growing global population. A Canadian-born executive who joined BHP in 2003 from Mitsubishi Corp., he inherited a business that had been stripped down and simplified under his predecessor, who sold out of shale and spun off unwanted assets, but still faced huge decisions on potash, the listing and the future of fossil fuels. “These are sweeping changes,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital. “The new, improved, not so-boring BHP.” The change to the listing structure means “they can be more nimble in the future,” he said. “It’s not just change today, but it means there’s more change coming tomorrow.” The dual listing dates back to 2001, following Australia-listed BHP’s merger with U.K.-listed Billiton, and had seen the companies managed and run as a single entity with shareholders having equal economic and voting rights. Elliott argued in 2018 that a reorganization into a single company in Australia would add more than US$22 billion in value to shareholders. BHP generates the bulk of its profits from iron ore and copper -- a metal that’s central to the green-energy transition -- and benefited from soaring prices for both commodities over the past year. The company is also trying to sell its thermal coal operations and is expanding in nickel, a vital material in rechargeable batteries. The commodities giant is getting out of oil and gas as the fossil-fuels industry grapples with global pressure from investors and governments over climate action, prompting some larger oil rivals to shrink their core production and add renewable energy assets. While BHP has said it expects demand to remain strong for at least another decade, the company wants to avoid getting stuck with assets that will become more difficult to sell. BHP has also finally approved the first stage of construction of the Jansen potash mine in Saskatchewan, Canada, after years of wavering over the huge price tag. The operation, expected to start production in 2027, will make it one of the world’s top producers of the crop nutrient. “Potash provides BHP with increased leverage to key global mega-trends, including rising population, changing diets, decarbonisation and improving environmental stewardship,” the company said. It’s also the latest sign that the biggest miners are ready to open their wallets to invest in new mines after years of austerity. The industry has been focused on shareholder returns and debt reduction after being penalized by investors. BHP has already spent about US$4.5 billion on Jansen and dug two 1,000-meter (3,300-feet) deep shafts but held off on a final development decision as it weighed the risks of the large investment. Potash prices have jumped this year amid strong demand, as well as worries about supply after Belarus, one of a handful of producing nations, was hit by sanctions. Like its biggest rivals, BHP reported bumper profits and dividends. Commodity prices surged in the past year as governments around the world unleash trillions of dollars in stimulus packages to help the global economy emerge from the pandemic, boosting demand for raw materials.

Beata Caranci, the bank’s chief economist, said her group could cut its fourth-quarter forecasts for Ontario and other provinces that don’t have plans to limit high-risk activities for people who are not vaccinated. That’s because those regions are more likely to resort to lockdowns or other restrictions on business activity. “Provinces who are more proactive in putting in measures that increase confidence in going to restaurants and concerts might do better than provinces who aren’t putting these measures in,” Caranci said by phone. That means Quebec’s economy could outperform Ontario’s because the French-speaking province is implementing a domestic passport system on Sept. 1 that would ban unvaccinated patrons from gyms and bars. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has so far resisted calls to implement a passport system. Vaccine passports could also keep overall confidence high among consumers and businesses, according to Caranci. “Are you taking every means possible to make sure your business stays open during this wave as vaccines buffer against hospitalization risk,” she said. “Those provinces doing that put themselves in a better position than those who don’t.” Besides Quebec, British Columbia will require proof of vaccination starting Sept. 13 for people attending certain social and recreational activities. Oil-rich Alberta has ruled out a vaccine passport while other provinces are still undecided. Nearly 75 per cent of eligible Canadians are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data compiled by CTV News, but rates vary by province. Alberta and Saskatchewan, another energy-producing province, are laggards, with just under 70 per cent fully inoculated. In the U.S., counties with higher vaccination rates are experiencing stronger economic growth than jurisdictions with fewer jabs.

However, experts say the most effective potential solutions have either received scant attention from the federal platforms, or have failed to be included at all. Five of them are broken down in detail below. 1. Leverage the weight of federal coffers Part of the challenge with trying to come up with a national fix for housing affordability is that it is fundamentally a local issue. Provincial and municipal governments generally have jurisdiction over the factors - such as zoning rules and building permits - that determine exactly what type of housing gets built, where that housing gets built and how fast. Ottawa “needs to figure out how to use the financial clout of the federal government to get changes done at a local and municipal level,” said Mike Moffatt, senior director of policy and innovation at the Smart Prosperity Institute. He notes the Conservative Party has suggested tying federal transit funding to a requirement that more housing be built along transit lines and the Liberal Party has proposed a $4-billion housing “accelerator” that “is designed to help municipalities modernize their zoning rules and approval processes.” “I think those are the right kind of approaches,” Moffatt said. “I think we need to go farther than that, but ultimately we need to get shovels in the ground, that is the only thing that is going to fix this.” Jill Atkey, CEO of the British Columbia Non-Profit Housing Association (BCNPHA), agreed that “the federal government needs to tie its infrastructure investments to affordable housing commitments.” “Too often we’ve seen the federal government come in - and this happens regularly in the lower mainland - making significant investments into transit with no requirement that affordable homes be built near that transit,” Atkey said. “In fact, we’ve seen affordable homes become displaced because of that transit investment. We need to reverse that trend and the federal government does have the tools to do that.” 2. Address the surge of international students “One thing that I was a little bit disappointed not to see in the various platforms” was a policy aimed at building more student housing, Moffatt said. “A lot of what is happening in the housing market is being driven by students, mostly international students.” Canada has experienced “huge enrollment spikes” from international students in recent years, he said, “and what happens is a lot of those students are ending up in homes, either buying them or in many cases renting them, so you’re getting these family homes that are being lived in by four-to-six college or university students that is reducing the overall supply of family homes.” As one example, Moffatt notes international enrollment in Fanshawe College just east of London, Ont. has grown by 6,000 people over the past five years: “If you just drop 6,000 extra people in east London, that is going to get you a housing shortage,” he said. “One of the things the federal government could do is work with colleges and universities to build more residences and apartments specifically for students,” Moffatt said. “You can do cost-sharing models with provinces and the colleges and universities themselves where they each basically pay one third. That would take a lot of the pressure off of the local housing markets.” 3. Let seniors sell their homes and live there too One of the most common complaints among aspiring home buyers - particularly Millennials - is that Baby Boomers and other seniors continue to live in large single-family homes long after their children have moved away. Diana Petramala, a former real estate economist with TD Bank who is now the senior economist for Ryerson University’s Centre for Urban Research and Land Development, said Ottawa could make it more attractive for seniors to move or even to renovate their existing homes into multiple units. “If you had more suitable seniors housing, maybe you would see more seniors being willing to leave their single-family homes and opening those up to more new generations of families,” Petramala said, noting senior women in particular prefer to move into apartment buildings that are no more than five stories. “The one thing that I didn’t see in any of the platforms and that I think is a constraint for seniors leaving their homes is helping them find the appropriate type of housing.” “A lot of our seniors housing is being built on the outskirts in these sort-of ‘seniors communities’ that are away from downtown and the places they actually lived,” Petramala said. “The federal government could offer financing specifically for seniors housing; not just providing more senior-friendly housing, but also helping with transaction costs such as realtor fees that might change some of the incentives for moving.” For seniors who simply do not wish to leave their lifelong homes, Petramala suggests a multigenerational housing tax credit as “a really good way to repurpose single-family homes and turning them into what has been called the ‘missing middle’.” “I think of my mother, for example, who is a senior and is living in a house with seven bedrooms where she could easily put an apartment in the basement or on the third floor and that would open up more housing for other families while allowing her to stay in the neighbourhood that she has come to love,” Petramala said. “I think that is a program that could work federally where it could help repurpose low-rise housing stock into the missing middle such as multiple apartments in large single family homes.” 4. Protect existing affordable rental stock from “financialization” While much of the focus for housing policies for the rental market has been on encouraging new supply, the BCNPHA’s Atkey says Ottawa “also needs to take a hard look at what is happening with our existing rental supply.” “We are seeing increasing investments by institutional players purchasing older, purpose-built rental stock - much of which was built with government incentives back in the 1970s and 80s - that are being purchased and turned into higher-income rentals and that is displacing a lot of people,” Atkey said. “When we look at the numbers in B.C. alone, how many of those affordable homes have already been lost, between 2011 and 2016 there were 320,000 of those units lost due to that financialization.” “The federal government needs to take a look at the tax structure, because right now it does prioritize institutional investors and rewards them,” Atkey said. “We are looking for the federal government to help the non-profit and co-op sectors purchase those buildings, because then they will stay affordable in perpetuity.” 5. Restrict access to credit If there is one single policy lever the federal government could pull that would profoundly improve housing affordability, it would be to “restrict the availability of credit,” said Hilliard MacBeth, author of When the Bubble Bursts: Surviving the Canadian Real Estate Crash. “Governments basically stopped intervening in the credit market in the 1970s and said they were going to let the private sector decide, but all we have gotten for that is a housing bubble so I suggested we go back to restricted credit,” MacBeth said. “The best would be three times household income, but obviously that would be extreme right at this moment because the average house costs about six times household income right now, so I think we could start at four times household income and then bring it down eventually to three times.” That would mean, for example, that a couple with a combined annual income of $100,000 could only borrow up to $300,000 for a mortgage at a three-to-one restriction and up to $400,000 at a four-to-one restriction. “Something more drastic needs to be done, but that would fix things,” MacBeth said. “Of course, the side effect of that would be quite severe in that there would be a dramatic drop in house prices since houses trade for the amount of debt that the banks are willing - or are able - to allocate.” Related Bank of Canada 'in a pickle' when it comes to housing: National Bank End of housing market on 'steroids' to hit growth: Macquarie 2021 federal election platform tracker: Where each party stands so far Top Stories 7:17 Calgary home sales in June set record for the month: CREB 5:38 Pandemic leading Canadians to flock to Vancouver, Halifax, report says 5:38 GTA rent prices slightly higher in May as market recovers Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Real Estate Jun 29, 2021 'Housing mania' sends affordability to 31-year low: RBC Ian Vandaelle, BNN Bloomberg The imbalance between supply and demand continues to prop up housing prices across Canada VIDEO SIGN OUT Up Next Now Showing {{ video.Duration | time }} The pandemic-driven surge in residential real estate demand has sent Canadian housing affordability spiraling to its worst level in more than three decades, according to a new report from RBC Economics. According to RBC, aggregate home ownership costs as a percentage of median household income rose 0.9 percentage points in the first quarter of this year to hit 52 per cent, the highest level since 1990. Affordability in the single-family home segment was even more dire, hitting 56.8 per cent in the quarter. In a report published Tuesday, RBC Senior Economist Robert Hogue said that the “housing mania” was unlikely to subside any time soon. “Tight demand-supply conditions maintain intense upward pressure on home prices. This is poised to raise the ownership bar higher-still for buyers in most markets, including smaller cities and rural areas that have attracted a lot of interest during the pandemic,” Hogue said. “In big cities, the affordability of condo apartments—the more viable option for many buyers—will likely erode as prices have recently begun to firm up.” RBC noted that the erosion in housing affordability was broad-based, with only the prairies and parts of Atlantic Canada remaining affordable to the average worker. While there has long been some degree of heat in Canada’s major population centres – average home prices in Toronto and Vancouver are sitting well above $1 million – the heat has spread outward into bedroom communities as remote work allowed Canadians to move further afield. That’s triggered double-digit price increases in communities in the Fraser Valley outside Vancouver and in the likes of Toronto suburbs such as Brampton and Pickering. Hogue said that migration to the suburbs has triggered bidding wars, further eroding affordability. “Bidding wars—a phenomenon previously confined to the most expensive markets—spread to many regions, resulting in steep price escalations,” he said. “The attendant rise in ownership costs far exceeded buyers’ income gains in the first quarter of 2021.” Related Younger Canadians drop financial advisers for DIY investing GTA rent prices slightly higher in May as market recovers Rapid rate hikes would be 'devastating' for housing: Tal Top Stories 7:17 Calgary home sales in June set record for the month: CREB 5:38 Pandemic leading Canadians to flock to Vancouver, Halifax, report says 5:38 GTA rent prices slightly higher in May as market recovers Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Lovely expects Governor Tiff Macklem to keep borrowing costs on hold, given recent economic setbacks including a weaker than expected GDP print, and in the U.S., a downturn for the jobs market and supply chain disruptions in the auto industry. “Not an easy place for the Bank of Canada,” said Lovely. “Given the risk and given the uncertainty, a sort of stand pat decision perhaps makes the most sense.” “Suffice it to say there are some question marks around the ability of the labour market to continue to generate good jobs.” Last week, Statistics Canada revealed an economic contraction of 1.1 per cent in the second quarter. Economists had been expecting growth at an annualized rate of 2.5 per cent. Lovely said it's obvious we’re in a distorted environment, and figures the recovery will continue to be jumpy with difficult periods. “We’re going to be going through the rest of this year, into next year, maybe even 2023, without knowing for certain where the country’s long-term trajectory is taking us,” he said. “We’d like to see a bit more of a balanced model where businesses are investing, becoming a bit more productive, contributing to the long-term expansion, and yes we also have population growth perhaps through immigration that’s contributing to growth.” While growth may be stagnating, inflation continues to accelerate. And Lovely isn’t as convinced as Macklem, and his U.S. counterpart Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, that consumer price inflation is merely temporary. “We see a lot of reasons to expect inflation to prove a bit sticky,” said Lovely. ""To remain perhaps in an uncomfortable zone for central bankers, not just for one or to months but an expected period of time.” Related Canada's election to foil FX traders hunting for volatility Liberals need to argue running a deficit is sustainable: EX-PBO Trudeau’s would-be successor makes gains with tax, housing plan Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

Leverage the weight of federal coffers Part of the challenge with trying to come up with a national fix for housing affordability is that it is fundamentally a local issue. Provincial and municipal governments generally have jurisdiction over the factors - such as zoning rules and building permits - that determine exactly what type of housing gets built, where that housing gets built and how fast. Ottawa “needs to figure out how to use the financial clout of the federal government to get changes done at a local and municipal level,” said Mike Moffatt, senior director of policy and innovation at the Smart Prosperity Institute. He notes the Conservative Party has suggested tying federal transit funding to a requirement that more housing be built along transit lines and the Liberal Party has proposed a $4-billion housing “accelerator” that “is designed to help municipalities modernize their zoning rules and approval processes.” “I think those are the right kind of approaches,” Moffatt said. “I think we need to go farther than that, but ultimately we need to get shovels in the ground, that is the only thing that is going to fix this.” Jill Atkey, CEO of the British Columbia Non-Profit Housing Association (BCNPHA), agreed that “the federal government needs to tie its infrastructure investments to affordable housing commitments.” “Too often we’ve seen the federal government come in - and this happens regularly in the lower mainland - making significant investments into transit with no requirement that affordable homes be built near that transit,” Atkey said. “In fact, we’ve seen affordable homes become displaced because of that transit investment. We need to reverse that trend and the federal government does have the tools to do that.” 2. Address the surge of international students “One thing that I was a little bit disappointed not to see in the various platforms” was a policy aimed at building more student housing, Moffatt said. “A lot of what is happening in the housing market is being driven by students, mostly international students.” Canada has experienced “huge enrollment spikes” from international students in recent years, he said, “and what happens is a lot of those students are ending up in homes, either buying them or in many cases renting them, so you’re getting these family homes that are being lived in by four-to-six college or university students that is reducing the overall supply of family homes.” As one example, Moffatt notes international enrollment in Fanshawe College just east of London, Ont. has grown by 6,000 people over the past five years: “If you just drop 6,000 extra people in east London, that is going to get you a housing shortage,” he said. “One of the things the federal government could do is work with colleges and universities to build more residences and apartments specifically for students,” Moffatt said. “You can do cost-sharing models with provinces and the colleges and universities themselves where they each basically pay one third. That would take a lot of the pressure off of the local housing markets.” 3. Let seniors sell their homes and live there too One of the most common complaints among aspiring home buyers - particularly Millennials - is that Baby Boomers and other seniors continue to live in large single-family homes long after their children have moved away. Diana Petramala, a former real estate economist with TD Bank who is now the senior economist for Ryerson University’s Centre for Urban Research and Land Development, said Ottawa could make it more attractive for seniors to move or even to renovate their existing homes into multiple units. “If you had more suitable seniors housing, maybe you would see more seniors being willing to leave their single-family homes and opening those up to more new generations of families,” Petramala said, noting senior women in particular prefer to move into apartment buildings that are no more than five stories. “The one thing that I didn’t see in any of the platforms and that I think is a constraint for seniors leaving their homes is helping them find the appropriate type of housing.” “A lot of our seniors housing is being built on the outskirts in these sort-of ‘seniors communities’ that are away from downtown and the places they actually lived,” Petramala said. “The federal government could offer financing specifically for seniors housing; not just providing more senior-friendly housing, but also helping with transaction costs such as realtor fees that might change some of the incentives for moving.” For seniors who simply do not wish to leave their lifelong homes, Petramala suggests a multigenerational housing tax credit as “a really good way to repurpose single-family homes and turning them into what has been called the ‘missing middle’.” “I think of my mother, for example, who is a senior and is living in a house with seven bedrooms where she could easily put an apartment in the basement or on the third floor and that would open up more housing for other families while allowing her to stay in the neighbourhood that she has come to love,” Petramala said. “I think that is a program that could work federally where it could help repurpose low-rise housing stock into the missing middle such as multiple apartments in large single family homes.” 4. Protect existing affordable rental stock from “financialization” While much of the focus for housing policies for the rental market has been on encouraging new supply, the BCNPHA’s Atkey says Ottawa “also needs to take a hard look at what is happening with our existing rental supply.” “We are seeing increasing investments by institutional players purchasing older, purpose-built rental stock - much of which was built with government incentives back in the 1970s and 80s - that are being purchased and turned into higher-income rentals and that is displacing a lot of people,” Atkey said. “When we look at the numbers in B.C. alone, how many of those affordable homes have already been lost, between 2011 and 2016 there were 320,000 of those units lost due to that financialization.” “The federal government needs to take a look at the tax structure, because right now it does prioritize institutional investors and rewards them,” Atkey said. “We are looking for the federal government to help the non-profit and co-op sectors purchase those buildings, because then they will stay affordable in perpetuity.” 5. Restrict access to credit If there is one single policy lever the federal government could pull that would profoundly improve housing affordability, it would be to “restrict the availability of credit,” said Hilliard MacBeth, author of When the Bubble Bursts: Surviving the Canadian Real Estate Crash. “Governments basically stopped intervening in the credit market in the 1970s and said they were going to let the private sector decide, but all we have gotten for that is a housing bubble so I suggested we go back to restricted credit,” MacBeth said. “The best would be three times household income, but obviously that would be extreme right at this moment because the average house costs about six times household income right now, so I think we could start at four times household income and then bring it down eventually to three times.” That would mean, for example, that a couple with a combined annual income of $100,000 could only borrow up to $300,000 for a mortgage at a three-to-one restriction and up to $400,000 at a four-to-one restriction. “Something more drastic needs to be done, but that would fix things,” MacBeth said. “Of course, the side effect of that would be quite severe in that there would be a dramatic drop in house prices since houses trade for the amount of debt that the banks are willing - or are able - to allocate.” Related Bank of Canada 'in a pickle' when it comes to housing: National Bank End of housing market on 'steroids' to hit growth: Macquarie 2021 federal election platform tracker: Where each party stands so far Top Stories 7:17 Calgary home sales in June set record for the month: CREB 5:38 Pandemic leading Canadians to flock to Vancouver, Halifax, report says 5:38 GTA rent prices slightly higher in May as market recovers Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

According to RBC, aggregate home ownership costs as a percentage of median household income rose 0.9 percentage points in the first quarter of this year to hit 52 per cent, the highest level since 1990. Affordability in the single-family home segment was even more dire, hitting 56.8 per cent in the quarter. In a report published Tuesday, RBC Senior Economist Robert Hogue said that the “housing mania” was unlikely to subside any time soon. “Tight demand-supply conditions maintain intense upward pressure on home prices. This is poised to raise the ownership bar higher-still for buyers in most markets, including smaller cities and rural areas that have attracted a lot of interest during the pandemic,” Hogue said. “In big cities, the affordability of condo apartments—the more viable option for many buyers—will likely erode as prices have recently begun to firm up.” RBC noted that the erosion in housing affordability was broad-based, with only the prairies and parts of Atlantic Canada remaining affordable to the average worker. While there has long been some degree of heat in Canada’s major population centres – average home prices in Toronto and Vancouver are sitting well above $1 million – the heat has spread outward into bedroom communities as remote work allowed Canadians to move further afield. That’s triggered double-digit price increases in communities in the Fraser Valley outside Vancouver and in the likes of Toronto suburbs such as Brampton and Pickering. Hogue said that migration to the suburbs has triggered bidding wars, further eroding affordability. “Bidding wars—a phenomenon previously confined to the most expensive markets—spread to many regions, resulting in steep price escalations,” he said. “The attendant rise in ownership costs far exceeded buyers’ income gains in the first quarter of 2021.” Related Younger Canadians drop financial advisers for DIY investing GTA rent prices slightly higher in May as market recovers Rapid rate hikes would be 'devastating' for housing: Tal Top Stories 7:17 Calgary home sales in June set record for the month: CREB 5:38 Pandemic leading Canadians to flock to Vancouver, Halifax, report says 5:38 GTA rent prices slightly higher in May as market recovers Subscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ © 2021 All Rights Reserved CTV News Sites"

More Video Investing Sep 23, 2021 Stocks wobble as China's crackdown roils crypto Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg News First Look With Surveillance: China Crackdown, German Elections VIDEO SIGN OUT Stocks struggled for direction after China intensified its sweeping regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ether and other digital tokens tumbled. In another blow to investor sentiment, the world’s second-largest economy said crypto-related transactions will now be considered illicit financial activity. Traders remained on guard for what Chinese regulators may target next as the government has also tightened its grip on sectors ranging from private education to digital gaming, e-cigarettes, property and insurance. “China is dealing with a few fiscal systemic challenges right now,” said David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. “My expectation is that this is ‘for real’ and that China will not reverse course on this position anytime soon, if ever. Nevertheless, if this move was inevitable, better that it happens sooner, so that the investment community can digest and move on.” Tech shares in the S&P 500 fell, while financial companies outperformed. The dollar climbed. Bitcoin slid about 6 per cent, while Ether plunged almost 13 per cent earlier Friday. Crypto-related stocks like Riot Blockchain Inc. and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. also tumbled. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index -- which tracks some of the Asian nation’s biggest firms listed in the U.S. -- sank as much as 3.6 per cent. Volatility in U.S. stocks and major developed currencies is swinging in lockstep by the most in more than a year, as risks from Beijing compete with central banks to drive market moves. China’s housing regulator boosted oversight of China Evergrande Group’s bank accounts to protect funds earmarked for housing projects from being diverted to creditors. Traders pulled US$28.6 billion from U.S. equity funds in the week through Sept. 22 -- the largest redemption since February 2018, according to a Bank of America Corp. note, which cited EPFR Global data. The U.S. economy has met the Federal Reserve’s conditions for starting to reduce its asset purchases soon, according to two regional Fed bank presidents. “I support starting to dial back our purchases in November and concluding them over the first half of next year,” Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester noted. Separately, her Kansas City counterpart Esther George said “the criteria for substantial further progress have been met,” referring to the central bank’s taper test. Some of the main moves in markets: Stocks The S&P 500 was little changed as of 1:07 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 fell 0.1 per cent The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed The MSCI World index fell 0.2 per cent Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2 per cent The euro fell 0.2 per cent to US$1.1716 The British pound fell 0.3 per cent to US$1.3676 The Japanese yen fell 0.4 per cent to 110.76 per dollar Bonds The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 1.45 per cent Germany’s 10-year yield advanced three basis points to -0.23 per cent Britain’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 0.92 per cent Commodities West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.3 per cent to US$74.27 a barrel Gold futures were little changed Top Picks 5:10 Eric Nuttall's Top Picks: September 24, 2021 4:04 David Burrows' Top Picks: September 23, 2021 4:22 Greg Newman's Top Picks: September 22, 2021 Top Stories Company News 7:01 Huawei CFO resolves fraud charges, may return to China Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was set free by a Canadian judge Friday, just a few hours after the unveiling of a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. prosecutors on fraud charges tied to alleged violations of sanctions against Iran. Investing 2:48 TSX falls for third straight week amid China events Canada's main stock index concluded its third losing week in a row by giving back some of its recent gains amid concerns out of China about the real estate market and the country's ban on cryptocurrencies. Politics 5:47 Small businesses face threats, backlash as vaccine passports take effect With the introduction of every new pandemic measure, The Hearty Hooligan restaurant in Hamilton has faced fake one-star reviews, online harassment, and disruptions at their location. Investing 7:29 A FAANG taper quake is what active manager dreams are made of While their stock-market obituaries have been retracted before, U.S. tech megacaps have the most to lose should the Federal Reserve make good on its pledge to revoke stimulus. Their demise would be welcome news to many investment managers.
