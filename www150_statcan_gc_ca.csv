By the end of March 2020, a sequence of unprecedented government interventions related to COVID-19—including the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions, and public health measures directing Canadians to limit public interactions—had been put in place. These interventions resulted in a dramatic slowdown in economic activity and a sudden shock to the Canadian labour market, which was documented with the results of the March Labour Force Survey (LFS). Data are now available from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), which provides a monthly portrait of payroll employment, earnings, and hours worked at the national level and by province/territory. When used in conjunction with the LFS, the SEPH helps complete the portrait of the Canadian labour market and Canada's economic performance, in large part through providing detailed subsector and industry statistics. Detailed data from SEPH are available on the Statistics Canada website. Monthly estimates for the SEPH are produced by using a combination of the Business Payrolls Survey (BPS) and a census of payroll deduction accounts provided by the Canada Revenue Agency. The reference period for the SEPH is the last seven days of the month (March 25 to 31). For businesses reporting pay periods longer than one week or outside of the reference period, data are adjusted to reflect the number of days worked during the reference period. The ""payroll employee"" concept used in the SEPH excludes the self-employed, as well as owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices. It also excludes persons who did not receive any pay from the employer for the entire survey reference period. However, employees who were on the payroll at any point during the last pay period of the month, even if they became unemployed during the pay period, are counted in payroll employment. In March, payroll employment in Canada decreased by 914,500 (-5.4%) compared with February, in line with the 5.3% decrease in total employment observed in the LFS. Payroll employment declined in all provinces, with the largest relative declines observed in Quebec (-7.5%) and British Columbia (-5.7%). Chart 1 Payroll employment declines by more than 900,000 in March Consistent with LFS results, SEPH data further demonstrate that low-paid workers have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 economic shutdown. More than 8 in 10 payroll employees who lost their jobs were paid hourly (unadjusted for seasonality). Hourly paid jobs represented a little less than 60% of all payroll employment in both February and March, and are prevalent in industrial sectors with low earnings. Chart 2 Larger job variation in March for hourly paid employees than for salaried employees SEPH data make it possible to more precisely measure the sector-by-sector timing of the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on the labour market. Results from the LFS indicated that the impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown was largely confined to the services sector in mid-March, with the majority of job losses among women. By mid-April, the impact had clearly spread to goods-producing industries, with the cumulative impact on men and women being more balanced. SEPH data complete this, showing that the goods-producing sector was affected by the last week in March, with both manufacturing (-104,300 or -6.7%) and construction (-77,600 or -7.4%) posting significant job losses. Along with employment, average weekly hours worked can serve as a measure of the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market. Average weekly hours for hourly paid employees declined by 1.1 hours to 29.5 hours in March, the lowest level on record. Average weekly hours for all payroll employees declined by 0.7 hours to 32.3 hours per week. The total weekly payroll (including overtime) for all employees declined 4.7% from February to March. At the same time, due to the larger employment decline among relatively low-paying jobs than in high-paying ones, average weekly earnings rose 0.6% to $1,053. Infographic 1 Largest employment decline in March in lowest-paid sector Nearly one in four job losses were in food services and drinking places In line with results from the LFS, from February to March, 41.0% of the decline in payroll employment was in accommodation and food services and retail trade. These two sectors have the lowest average weekly earnings, potentially placing some lower-paid workers in further or continued financial hardship. Detailed subsector data available from SEPH reveal that nearly one in four payroll jobs lost from February to March were in the food services and drinking places subsector (-204,800 or -18.0%). This subsector was heavily impacted by the third week of March, by which time measures related to COVID-19―such as mandatory closures or orders to provide curtailed services, like takeout―took effect. These employment losses represented the vast majority (87.6%) of the decline in accommodation and food services (-233,800 or -17.4%), partly due to the subsector's large share of employment in the sector. A notable decline was also observed in accommodation services (-29,000 or -14.3%), the other subsector in accommodation and food services. Average weekly earnings in accommodation and food services were little changed at $429 in March. In retail trade (-140,900 or -7.0%), payroll employment declined across all 12 subsectors, with the largest proportional decreases in furniture and home furnishings stores (-12,300 or -16.9%), sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (-11,000 or -13.2%) and motor vehicle and parts dealers (-29,200 or -13.0%). Due in part to the relatively higher average weekly earnings in motor vehicle and parts dealers, where the largest number of payroll jobs were lost in retail trade, average weekly earnings in the sector fell 2.3% to $610 in March. The large employment losses in the accommodation and food services and retail trade sectors largely explain why overall employment losses in March were concentrated among hourly paid employees. Each sector has a higher-than-average proportion of hourly paid employees (more than 8 in 10 in each sector in February and March, compared with a little less than 6 in 10 across all sectors). Employment losses in both accommodation and food services and retail trade follow a period of long-term gains since the last recession, though the pace of growth had flattened somewhat in recent months. Less impact on some high-paying sectors Payroll employment and total earnings were virtually unchanged in the relatively higher-paying public administration and finance and insurance sectors. Workers in these sectors may not usually have duties requiring close physical contact with others, are more likely to have the option to telework, and, as such, may have been less impacted by the economic shutdown. Average weekly earnings in finance and insurance increased 4.7% in March. Declining oil prices and a decreasing international demand for oil due to reduced economic activity did not negatively impact payroll employment and earnings in oil and gas extraction in March. Employment in the subsector increased month over month (+2.8%) and earnings did not vary significantly. Payroll employment in other natural resources subsectors such as mining and forestry was also little changed in March. Some high-paying sectors where physical distancing or teleworking are less practical were affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown. Construction employment decreased 7.4% in March, with the largest decline occurring in Quebec (-15.0%). In Canada overall, heavy and civil engineering construction was relatively less affected (-4.0%) as some ongoing infrastructure projects were allowed to continue. Payroll employment in motor vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing declined by 20,900 in Canada, as automotive assembly plants across North America shut down production in mid-March. This decline contributed to an overall decrease of 104,300 (-6.7%) in the number of payroll employees in manufacturing. Mixed portrait in the health care and social assistance sector Many health care and social assistance workers have been on the frontline of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19, however, has differed by subsector and industry, with some reducing their activities to contain the outbreak and others providing critical care to vulnerable populations. The SEPH provides detailed labour-related information about the subsectors and industries in health care and social assistance, building on earlier, high-level information reported in the LFS release for March. The number of payroll employees in hospitals was little changed in March. Overtime earnings, however, rose by about one-quarter compared with February (not seasonally adjusted), as COVID-19 was spreading and the workload at hospitals had increased. Community care facilities for the elderly, which include long-term care facilities, have been hit very hard by the crisis, with many residents and staff exposed to the coronavirus. Employment in community care facilities for the elderly was little changed in March, but total overtime pay increased by 19.3% (not seasonally adjusted), and average weekly earnings increased by 2.8%. Despite this increase in earnings, and other increases that have taken place since the middle of 2019, payroll jobs in community care facilities for the elderly remained among the lowest-paid sectors, with the average earnings amounting to two-thirds of the overall Canadian average. Payroll employment in ambulatory health care services declined by 36,000 in March, with notable declines for offices of dentists and offices of physicians as non-urgent appointments were cancelled or rescheduled. This is the largest monthly decline in the subsector since comparable data became available in 2001. Weekly hours worked of hourly paid employees declined, notably for offices of dentists (unadjusted for seasonality). In child-care services, payroll employment declined by 16,000 (-10.4%) as many day-cares closed across the country in March, with the exception of those providing services for children of essential service workers. Payroll employment in health care and social assistance as a whole declined by 62,800 (-3.0%) month over month. Employment in the sector had been following a long-term upward trend until January. A large proportion of workers in the sector are self-employed, according to the LFS, notably in child-care services and in ambulatory health care services, and so are not included in payroll employment. Looking ahead Beginning in early May, some jurisdictions began to ease some of the public health and economic restrictions related to COVID-19. May LFS data—reflecting labour market conditions for the week of May 10 to 16—will be released on June 5 and will provide a first indication of whether this initial easing has had an impact on labour market conditions. Of particular importance will be variations in labour market conditions across regions, industries and population groups. SEPH data will continue to complement the LFS by shedding additional light on the labour market impacts of COVID-19, including the impact on employment, earnings and hours within subsectors. SEPH results for April 2020 will be released on June 25. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately one million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and LFS differ from time to time. However, the trends in the data are quite similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees, as well as for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Real-time data tables Real-time tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on June 8. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours for April will be released on June 25.

Context: COVID-19 restrictions gradually ease Labour Force Survey (LFS) results for June reflect labour market conditions as of the week of June 14 to June 20. By then, public health restrictions had been substantially eased in most parts of the country. Tighter restrictions remained in place in much of southwestern Ontario, including Toronto. As businesses and workplaces continued to re-open across the country, physical distancing and other requirements remained in place. Likewise, large gatherings continued to be limited. This gradual easing of restrictions and the re-opening of the economy continued to present both opportunities and challenges for employers and workers. Employers continued to adapt workplaces to ensure the health and safety of workers, customers and the public. Some workers returned to a previous employer while others looked for new work. For many Canadians, adapting to new ways of working included making new child care arrangements. Ongoing survey enhancements to measure the labour market in exceptional times A series of survey enhancements continued in June, including additional questions on working from home, difficulty meeting financial needs, and receipt of federal COVID-19 assistance payments. New questions were added to measure the extent to which COVID-19-related health risks are being mitigated through workplace adaptations and protective measures. This release continues the practice of recent months of integrating the internationally standardized concepts of employment and unemployment with supplementary indicators that help capture the full scope of the labour market disruption. Data from the LFS are based on a sample of more than 50,000 households every month. In June, Statistics Canada continued to protect the health and safety of Canadians by adjusting the processes involved in conducting these interviews. We are deeply grateful to the many Canadians who responded to the survey. Their ongoing cooperation ensures that we continue to paint an accurate and current portrait of the Canadian labour market and Canada's economic performance. Infographic 1 Highlights part 1 Infographic 2 Highlights part 2 Infographic 3 Highlights part 3 Employment continues to rebound as reopening of economy continues From February to April, 5.5 million Canadian workers were affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown. This included a drop in employment of 3.0 million and a COVID-related increase in absences from work of 2.5 million. By the week of June 14 to June 20, the number of workers affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown was 3.1 million, a reduction since April of 43%. Building on an initial recovery of 290,000 in May, employment rose by nearly one million in June (+953,000; +5.8%), with gains split between full-time work (+488,000 or +3.5%) and part-time work (+465,000 or +17.9%). With these two consecutive increases, employment in June was 1.8 million (-9.2%) lower than in February. The number of Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 dropped by 823,000 in June. Combined with declines recorded in May, this left absences from work 1.4 million above pre-COVID levels. Chart 1 Employment gains continue in June Initial recovery in employment sharper than in previous economic downturns The employment losses resulting from the COVID-19 economic shutdown were unprecedented in their speed and depth. In just two months, employment fell to 15.7% below pre-COVID February levels. By comparison, the 1981/1982 recession resulted in a total employment decline of 5.4% (-612,000) over approximately 17 months. With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in May and June, the initial recovery of employment—to within 9.2% of pre-COVID levels—has been sharper than in previous downturns, when recovery to pre-downturn employment has taken from two to five years. Infographic 4 Employment changes indexed from beginning of notable downturns, 1980 to 2020, Canada In all age groups, men are closer to pre-shutdown employment levels than women In June, employment rose slightly faster among women (+6.1% or +467,000) than men (+5.5% or +487,000). On a cumulative basis however, after including May gains, employment among men had recovered to 92.3% of its February level, compared with 89.2% among women. In each of the three major age groups—youth aged 15-24, core-aged workers aged 25-54 and those aged 55 and older—recovery of COVID-19-related employment losses was more advanced among men than among women. Infographic 5 Recovery of COVID-related employment losses more advanced among men Unemployment rate drops in June after reaching record high in May The unemployment rate was 12.3% in June, a drop of 1.4 percentage points from a record-high of 13.7% in May. While this was the largest monthly decline on record, the unemployment rate remains much higher than February, when it was 5.6%. While the unemployment rate for all major demographics groups fell in June, it remained slightly higher for women (12.7%) than for men (12.1%). Temporary layoffs decline while employment increases Approximately 2.5 million Canadians were unemployed in June, a decrease of 167,000 (-6.4%) from May but more than double the February level (1.1 million). The unemployed include three main categories: those on temporary layoff, who expect to return to a previous job within six months; those who do not expect to return to a previous job and are looking for work; and those who have arrangements to begin a new job within four weeks. Typically, relatively few of the unemployed are on temporary layoff and the vast majority are job searchers. The labour market shock stemming from the COVID-19 shutdown resulted in a sudden disruption of this pattern. In April, half (49.6%) of the unemployed were on temporary layoff. As COVID restrictions are eased and economic activity resumes, it is expected that the number of people on temporary layoff will decrease as people return to their previous job or, either by necessity or choice, transition to looking for new work. After holding steady in May, the number of people on temporary layoff fell by 29.1% (-347,000) in June, driven by a decline among core-aged workers aged 25-54. Following this decline, one-third of the unemployed (34.4% or 844,000) were on temporary layoff, while two-thirds (65.6% or 1.6 million) were searching for work in June. Infographic 6 Number of people on temporary layoff declines The number of job seekers grows while more Canadians engage in the labour market The COVID-19 economic shutdown led to a sharp increase in the number of people who wanted a job but did not meet the definition of unemployed because they did not look for work, presumably because they had little confidence in finding a new job. In May, as the initial easing of COVID-19 restrictions began, the number of people who wanted a job but did not look for one began to fall, accompanied by an increase in the number of people actively looking for work. In June, these trends continued, with an increase in job-seekers (+180,000; +12.6%), observed mostly among youth, and a drop in those who wanted a job but did not look for one (-448,000; -32.1%). Chart 2 Number of people looking for work continues to grow If those who wanted to work but did not look for a job were included as unemployed in June, it would result in an adjusted unemployment rate of 16.3%, a decline of 3.3 percentage points compared with the adjusted rate in May Increase in labour force participation, with notable differences between men and women From February to April, the number of people who were active in the labour market—who were either employed or unemployed—declined by 1.7 million. This was driven by increases in both the number of people who wanted a job but did not look for one and the number of people who did not want a job, including those who had taken on other responsibilities as a result of the COVID-19 economic shutdown. In June, as COVID-19-related restrictions eased, the number of people participating in the labour force rose by 786,000 (+4.1%). This followed an increase of 491,000 (+2.6%) in May and brought the total labour force to within 443,000 of its pre-COVID February level. The labour force participation rate—that is, the labour force as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older—rose by 2.4 percentage points to 63.8% in June, compared with 65.5% in February. The growth in labour force participation towards pre-COVID levels was not equal for men and women. The participation rate for core-aged men was up 2.7 percentage points to 90.3% in June, 0.8 percentage points below the February level. For core-aged women, the participation rate rose 2.5 percentage points to 82.0%, 1.4 percentage points short of the February level. Labour underutilization less of a factor in June Labour underutilization occurs when people who could potentially work are not, or when people could work more hours than they are currently. The ""labour underutilization rate"" combines those who were unemployed; those who were not in the labour force but who wanted a job and did not look for one; and those who were employed but worked less than half of their usual hours. As the economy continued to recover in June, labour underutilization eased. In June, a little more than one-quarter (26.9%) of the potential labour force was fully or partially underutilized, down notably from more than one-third in May (34.3%), but remained substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels. The rate in June declined the most for youth (down 11.3 percentage points to 40.5%), followed by core-aged people (down 7.2 percentage points to 23.6%) and people aged 55 and older (down 6.4 percentage points to 27.6%). While the labour underutilization rate was similar for men and women prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate has been higher for women since February. In June, the rate was 28.3% for women and 25.5% for men. Infographic 7 Labour underutilization rate continues to decline Employment increases in all provinces By the LFS reference week of June 14 to June 20, all provinces had substantially eased COVID-19 restrictions. For most provinces, this was the continuation of a process that had started in early May. For others, including Ontario, the easing of restrictions began after the May LFS reference week. This continued easing of restrictions was reflected in provincial labour markets. In June, all provinces recorded an increase in employment and a decrease in COVID-related absences. In Ontario, where the easing of COVID-19 restrictions began in late May and expanded on June 12, employment rose by 378,000 (+5.9%) in June, the first increase since the COVID-19 economic shutdown. The proportion of employed people who worked less than half of their usual hours declined by 6.5 percentage points to 14.1% in Ontario. The unemployment rate declined 1.4 percentage points to 12.2% as the number of people on temporary layoff declined. In the census metropolitan area of Toronto, where the easing of some COVID-19 restrictions was delayed until June 24, the recovery rate was slightly below that of Ontario in June. The employment level in Toronto was 89.6% of the February level, compared with 94.5% for the rest of the province (not adjusted for seasonality). Quebec recorded employment gains of 248,000 (+6.5%) in June, adding to similar gains (+231,000) in May and bringing employment to 92.2% of its February level. At the same time, the number of unemployed people in the province declined for the second consecutive month in June (-119,000), pushing the unemployment rate down 3.0 percentage points to 10.7%. The decline in unemployment in Quebec was entirely driven by fewer people on temporary layoff. The number of people employed in British Columbia rose by 118,000 (+5.4%) in June, following an increase of 43,000 in May. The proportion of employed people who worked less than half of their usual hours declined by 2.9 percentage points to 14.6%. The number of unemployed in the province was little changed in June and the unemployment rate edged down 0.4 percentage points to 13.0%. In the Western provinces, employment increased in Saskatchewan (+30,000) for the first time since the COVID-19 economic shutdown and rose for the second consecutive month in both Alberta (+92,000) and Manitoba (+29,000). In New Brunswick, the first province to begin easing COVID-19 restrictions, employment increased by 22,000 in June. Combined with May gains, this brought employment in the province to 97.1% of its pre-COVID February level, the most complete employment recovery of all provinces to date. Employment increased for the second consecutive month in Nova Scotia (+29,000), Newfoundland and Labrador (+6,000) and Prince Edward Island (+1,700). Chart 3 Employment increases in all provinces in June but remains below February levels In the second quarter of 2020, the number of people employed in Yukon declined by an estimated 1,200 people, compared with the first quarter of the year. Over the same period, employment as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older fell by 4.4 percentage points to 65.6%. The unemployment rate increased from 3.2% in the first quarter to 6.2% in the second quarter of 2020. Compared with the first quarter of the year, employment In the Northwest Territories fell by an estimated 1,300 people in the quarter ending in June. The unemployment rate was little changed at 9.6%, as fewer people participated in the labour market. In the second quarter of 2020, employment in Nunavut declined by 2,100 people compared with the first quarter. Over the same period, labour force participation also fell, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 15.3%, as fewer people participated in the labour market. As more Canadians work at locations other than home, employment grows across industries Workplace adaptations expand beyond working from home Across industries, the proportion of jobs requiring close physical proximity to others varies widely. In some sectors of the economy—such as public administration and finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing—relatively few jobs require close proximity with co-workers, clients or the public. In some industries—such as retail trade, accommodation and food services—a large proportion of jobs require such contact, with the associated risk of COVID-19 transmission. By the week of April 12 to April 18, a total of 3.3 million Canadians had responded to public health restrictions by shifting from their usual workplaces to working from home. In industries where a relatively low proportion of jobs require physical proximity to others and can be performed remotely, working from home was a crucial early adaptation to the COVID-19 economic shutdown and was instrumental in mitigating further employment losses. For industries where a high proportion of jobs require physical proximity to others, adapting by working from home was less widespread and job losses were heavy. By April, for example, employment in accommodation and food services had fallen to 50% below its pre-COVID February level. As the easing of COVID-19 restrictions continues, restoring the confidence of workers and consumers by mitigating COVID-19 health risks will be a crucial factor in the recovery of the labour market. Recent data from the Canadian Perspective Survey Series, for example, indicate that close to 4 in 10 Canadians who had shifted to working from home or were absent from work during the week of June 9 did not feel safe in returning to their usual workplace. New data from the Labour Force Survey shed light on the extent to which employers have begun to address these concerns through workplace adaptations and other protective measures. Among those who worked at a location other than home during the week of June 14 to June 20, about 8 in 10 reported that their workplace had introduced enhanced cleaning protocols (80.8%) or had reorganized the workplace or work practices (79.6%). More than 8 in 10 (83.4%) reported that they had access to personal protective equipment, while a similar proportion (87.9%) indicated that they had increased access to hand sanitizing or hand washing facilities. More Canadians working at locations other than home The easing of restrictions, the introduction of protective measures and new workplace adaptations are reflected in the number of Canadians working at locations other than home. Among those who were employed and worked at least half of their usual hours, working at locations other than home increased by 2 million in June, while the number of Canadians working from home fell by 400,000. In June, as in previous months, there were notable differences in the profile of those working from home and those working at other locations. A majority of those working at locations other than home and who worked at least half of their usual hours were men (58.9%). In contrast, those who worked from home were about equally likely to be men or women. Less than one-quarter (23.3%) of those working at a location other than home had a bachelor's degree or higher, compared with 6 in 10 (58.5%) of those who worked from home. As workplaces adapt, employment continues to rebound in accommodation and food services and in retail trade In the accommodation and food services industry, three in four jobs (74.5%) involve close physical proximity with others. In retail trade, the equivalent figure is 63.4%. Both industries, which were hardest hit by the employment losses resulting from the COVID-19 economic shutdown, recorded large employment gains for the second consecutive month in June. Employment rose by 164,000 in accommodation and food services and by 184,000 in retail trade. Despite these gains, employment in both industries remained well below pre-COVID-19 February levels. By the week of June 14 to June 20, employment in accommodation and food services was 66.7% of its February level. Retail trade was further along in its recovery, with employment in June being 88.7% of the February level. In June, nearly all workers in accommodation and food services (93.6%) reported having access to personal protective equipment, with the proportion only slightly lower in retail trade (87.7%). In both industries, smaller firms were disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 economic shutdown in March and April. From May to June, employment in accommodation and food services increased by 39.9% for small firms (fewer than 20 employees), compared with 27.9% for medium and large firms (20 employees or more). In June, employment in retail trade reached 92.3% of February levels for small firms, compared with 89.7% for medium and large firms. For the second consecutive month, both the proportion of people working less than 50% of their usual hours and the number of unemployed people on temporary layoff who had worked in the industry in the past 12 months fell in retail trade and accommodation and food services (not seasonally adjusted). However, the number of job searchers who had last worked in those industries also increased for the second consecutive month, suggesting that while many are returning to work, a number of people previously employed in those industries are not expecting to return to their previous job (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 4 Employment in accommodation and food services now at two-thirds of what it was in February Employment increases in educational services and in health care and social assistance A high proportion of jobs in both the health care and social assistance and educational services industries involve close proximity to others. As most provinces continued to lift COVID-19 restrictions in June, including restrictions on non-essential health care services, employment in the health care and social assistance industry increased by 121,000, reaching 95.8% of its pre-COVID-19 level. Among health care and social assistance workers who were working outside their home in June, nearly all (94.9%) reported having access to personal protective equipment. In the educational services industry, employment increased by 57,000 from April to June, with the number of employed people reaching 92.6% of its February level. Many workers in educational services have shifted their main place of work to their home, with two-thirds (66.9%) working from home during the week of June 14. Modest employment rebound in other services-producing industries The information, culture and recreation industry was subject to some of the earliest public health restrictions in the form of limitations on the size of gatherings, and all provinces continued to limit the number of people allowed to gather in public in June. While a notable increase in employment was observed in June (+60,000), employment in this industry was 83.1% of its pre-COVID level, the second-lowest proportion across all industries. In business, building, and other support services, employment increased by 71,000 in June, bringing the total number of employed people to 93.0% of February levels. Employment also grew by 46,000 in the ""other services"" industry—which includes hair salons and barbershops as well as religious and civic organizations—and by 44,000 in transportation and warehousing. Employment nearest to pre-COVID level in services-producing industries with fewest jobs involving close physical proximity In several services-producing industries—such as wholesale trade, public administration, and finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing—fewer than 40% of jobs involve close proximity with others. In many of these industries, employment in June was at or near pre-COVID-shutdown levels. Monthly employment gains were recorded in wholesale trade (+38,000) and in finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing (+17,000). Employment returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in wholesale trade, while it was 1.0% lower than pre-COVID-19 levels in finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing. While there were no employment gains in public administration, and in professional, scientific and technical services in June, COVID-19-related employment losses have been relatively small in both industries. Compared with February, employment was 2.2% lower in public administration and 5.0% lower in professional, scientific and technical services. In most industries where few jobs require close physical proximity with others, workers have shifted to working from home on a large scale. In finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing, 6 in 10 (61.2%) were working from home during the week of June 14, more than double the proportion (28.5%) who usually do so. A larger-than-usual proportion of workers also continued to work from home in professional, scientific and technical services (73.2%) and public administration (53.8%). Large employment rebound in goods-producing industries After avoiding large job losses in the first month of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, both the construction and manufacturing industries experienced heavy losses in April, followed by an initial recovery in May. In June, employment in construction was 157,000 higher than in April, reaching 89.3% of its February level. In the manufacturing industry, employment gains in May and June totalled 160,000, bringing employment to 91.9% of its February level. In each of the construction and manufacturing industries, both the proportion of people working less than 50% of their usual work hours and the number of people on temporary layoff fell markedly in June. Construction recorded a 53.8% decrease in the number of people on temporary layoff (not adjusted for seasonality). After increasing from April to May, employment declined in natural resources in June (-6,000), with the loss almost entirely in Quebec. Employment in the industry was virtually unchanged in Alberta in June, and was at 93.8% of the February level. Nationally, employment in the industry was at 95.4% of its February level. Most workers in goods-producing industries reported that they or their employer had put in place measures to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19. However, some adaptation measures were less common in agriculture, where fewer than 5 workers in 10 had access to personal protective equipment at work (47.8%) and just under 6 in 10 were working in an environment where enhanced cleaning protocols (57.0%) were in place. Significant labour market challenges remain for youth, students, and low-wage workers Youth employment records strong gains, but remains far below pre-COVID levels Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 jumped by 15.4% (+263,000) in June, in line with the gradual reopening of industries with higher concentrations of young workers, such as accommodation and food services and retail trade. From February to April, employment among youth decreased by over one-third (-34.2%; -873,000). By June, employment was still down 22.7% (-580,000) compared with February, with the deficit being larger for young women (-26.4%) than young men (-19.1%). The job market for returning students significantly worse than one year ago Returning students—those who were enrolled full-time in March and intend to return in September—continued to face particularly challenging labour market conditions in June. On a year-over-year basis, employment for this group was down 277,000 (-23.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). This compares with a decline of 190,000 (-15.3%) among non-student youth (not seasonally adjusted). From May to June, however, employment for returning students rose by 263,000 (+39.6%) (not adjusted for seasonality). This increase was larger than typically observed from May to June (approximately 100,000 in recent years), a possible indication that the job market for students had improved somewhat in June. Chart 5 Among youth and young adults, returning students facing toughest job market The unemployment rate in June was 33.1% for returning students, up from 12.7% in June 2019, and 20.6% for non-student youth, up from 8.5%. Among returning students aged 20 to 24—who were most likely to have completed their current year of studies by June—the unemployment rate jumped from 8.0% in June 2019 to 33.3% in June 2020. There were 93,000 (-19.0%) fewer 17- to 19-year-old returning students working in June 2020 compared with June 2019 and all of the decrease was in part-time work. The unemployment rate for these younger students rose by 17.3 percentage points to 31.4%, as the number seeking employment soared by 126.9%. In May, the federal government opened the application process for temporary financial supports targeted specifically at post-secondary students and recent graduates. Supplementary questions added to the June LFS indicate that 12.7% of youth aged 18 to 24 had received payments for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), while more than one-quarter (28.5%) had received payments for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). Employment among low wage workers, particularly women, remains below pre-COVID levels The labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown was particularly severe for lower-wage workers. From February to April, employment among employees who earned less than $16.03 per hour (two-thirds of the 2019 annual median wage of $24.04/hour) fell by 38.1%, compared with a decline of 12.7% for all other paid employees (not adjusted for seasonality). In June, employment grew more strongly among lower-wage (+19.3%; +414,000) than among other employees (+6.0%; +699,000) (not adjusted for seasonality). Nevertheless, the recovery rate among low-wage workers (78.8% of the February level) was noticeably lower than the rate among other employees (96.7%) (not adjusted for seasonality). In June, employment levels among female workers in a low-wage job had reached 74.8% of their February levels, versus 84.7% for their male counterparts (not adjusted for seasonality). Chart 6 Fast employment growth among low-wage workers Among parents, employment recovery slowest for mothers with school-aged children In June, employment among core-aged workers whose youngest child was less than 6 years old increased for both men (+6.4%) and women (+5.2%). By the week of June 14 to June 20, when daycare services for children aged 0 to 5 had reopened in some provinces, employment had returned to February levels for fathers in this group (unadjusted for seasonality) and had edged close to pre-COVID levels for mothers. Among parents whose youngest child was aged 6 to 17, employment increased in June for fathers, approaching February levels. Among mothers whose youngest child was aged 6 to 17, however, employment remained about 5 percentage points away from the pre-COVID level, despite a month-over-month gain of 2.6% (unadjusted for seasonality). As the easing of COVID-19 restrictions continues in the coming months, and as children aged 6 to 17 begin to return to school in September, the ability of mothers of these children to return to pre-COVID employment levels will be of particular interest to monitor. A greater proportion of core-aged women with children under 18 (14.3%) worked less than half their usual hours compared with their male counterparts (8.7%) in June, although both shares have decreased significantly since April (unadjusted for seasonality). While the proportions for both women and men remain higher than before the COVID-19 period, the greater tendency for mothers to be absent from work compared with fathers has been a long-standing trend. Chart 7 Employment among some core-age parents returning to pre-COVID levels Fewer people living in families where no one is employed In June, the number of people living in couples where neither partner was employed fell for a second consecutive month (-4.6%), while the number of people living in couples in which only one partner was employed also decreased (-7.0%) (not adjusted for seasonality). Although the number of people in these non- and single-earner couple arrangements has declined since April, it remains substantially above pre-COVID levels. The number of single parents who were not employed also fell in June (-11.9%), with the decline in percentage terms larger among men. On average, about three-quarters of single parent families in Canada are headed by women. Small decline in proportion of people living in households reporting difficulty meeting financial needs In June, more than one-quarter (28.3%) of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some kind of federal income assistance payment since March 15 (the CERB, the CESB, regular Employment Insurance benefits, or new benefits for which they were unsure of the source). The share was higher among those living in households reporting difficulty meeting financial needs (40.7%) compared with those in households who reported it was easy to meet financial needs (21.7%). Since April, the LFS has included a supplementary question about difficulty meeting basic household financial needs, such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and groceries. In June, in the context of continuing employment recovery and ongoing unprecedented government income assistance payments, the proportion of Canadians living in households reporting such difficulties declined slightly, from 22.5% in May to 20.1%. Among people aged 25 to 54, just over half (51.5%) of those in couples where neither partner is employed lived in households reporting difficulty meeting financial needs, compared with 13.9% of those in couples where both partners are employed. These results are not notably different from those recorded in April, and may reflect differences that were present before the onset of the COVID-19 shutdown. Employment rate up among very recent immigrants In June, the employment rate among very recent immigrants (five years or less) rose 3.9 percentage points to 58.5%, driven in part by a decline in the size of this population group. The month-over-month rise was comparable to increases observed among landed immigrants of more than five years (+3.2 percentage points to 53.7%) and those born in Canada (+3.7 percentage points to 58.2%). Comparable employment recovery between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples In June, employment increased by 4.1% (+21,000) among Aboriginal people living off-reserve compared with 6.9% (+1,113,000) among the non-Aboriginal population (not adjusted for seasonality). This brought employment to 6.9% below February levels among Aboriginal people, compared with 6.1% below among the non-Aboriginal population. In June, the employment rate for Aboriginal people living off-reserve was 4.4 percentage points below the February rate, compared with 3.9 percentage points for the non-Aboriginal population. Looking ahead The labour market shock resulting from the COVID-19 economic shutdown has had an unequal impact on different groups of Canadians. In March and April, a disproportionate share of job loss was felt by youth, women and low-paid workers. LFS results from May and June indicate that these same groups face a longer path to labour market recovery than others. At the same time, workers in a number of industries have continued to work during the COVID-19 shutdown and initial recovery, despite their jobs involving close contact with others, and the associated risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus. Recent data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours, for example, showed that overtime earnings of hospital workers increased by almost one-third (+31.2%, not seasonally adjusted) in April. In July, the Labour Force Survey will begin asking respondents to report the ethno-cultural groups to which they belong. This will help to equip policymakers with the information needed to address social and economic inequalities, including the impact of COVID-19 across diverse populations. Results based on this new question will be included in the release of July LFS results on August 7.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for June are for the week of June 14 to 20. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. Since March 2020, all face-to-face interviews were replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both interviewers and respondents. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. In June, approximately 40,000 interviews were completed, compared with 40,700 in May. The distribution of LFS interviews in June 2020 compared with May 2020, was as follows: Personal face-to-face interviews • May 2020 0.0% • June 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from call centres • May 2020 0.0% • June 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • May 2020 68.3% • June 2020 69.2% Online interviews • May 2020 31.7% • June 2020 30.8% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in June 2020 analysis To continue capturing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the supplementary indicators used in April have been slightly adapted in May and June. Therefore, they are not directly comparable to the supplementary indicators published in April and March 2020. Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Time-related underemployment rate combines people who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours as a proportion of all employed people.

Context: COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease The July Labour Force Survey (LFS) results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of July 12 to 18, four months after the beginning of the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic. By then, businesses and workplaces across Canada were continuing to re-open, building on the resumption of economic activities that began in May and continued in June. Although public health restrictions had been substantially eased in most parts of the country—with the exception of some regions of Ontario, including Toronto—some measures remained in place, including physical distancing requirements and restrictions on large gatherings. Adapting new measures to assess the labour market as lifting of COVID-19 restrictions continues This LFS release continues the recent practice of integrating the international standard concepts such as employment and unemployment with supplementary indicators to help monitor the labour market as restrictions are lifted and capture the full scope of the impacts of COVID-19. A series of survey enhancements were continued in July, including supplementary questions on working from home, workplace adaptations and financial capacity. New questions were added on concerns related to returning to usual workplaces and receipt of federal COVID-19 support payments. For the first time, this release also includes information on the labour market conditions of population groups designated as visible minorities. Through the addition of a new survey question and the introduction of new statistical methods, the LFS is now able to more fully determine the impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown on diverse groups of Canadians. Data from the LFS are based on a sample of more than 50,000 households. In July, Statistics Canada continued to protect the health and safety of Canadians by adjusting the processes involved in survey operations. We are deeply grateful to the many Canadians who responded to the survey. Their ongoing cooperation ensures that we continue to paint an accurate and current portrait of the Canadian labour market and Canada's economic performance. Infographic 1 Highlights part 1 Infographic 2 Highlights part 2 Employment continues to rebound in July From February to April, 5.5 million Canadian workers were affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown. This included a drop in employment of 3.0 million and a COVID-related increase in absences from work of 2.5 million. Employment rose by 419,000 (+2.4%) in July, compared with 953,000 (+5.8%) in June. Combined with gains of 290,000 in May, this brought employment to within 1.3 million (-7.0%) of its pre-COVID February level. The number of Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 dropped by 412,000 (-18.8%) in July. Combined with declines recorded in May and June, this left COVID-related absences from work at just under 1 million (+972,000; +120.3%) above February levels. By the week of July 12 to July 18, the total number of affected workers stood at 2.3 million, a reduction since April of 58.0%. Chart 1 Employment rebound continues, but slows in July Most employment gains in July were in part-time work Most of the employment gains in July were in part-time work, which increased by 345,000 (+11.3%), compared with a much smaller increase of 73,000 (+0.5%) in full-time work. The COVID-19 labour market shock was felt particularly hard in part-time work. From February to April, losses in part-time work (-29.6%) were significantly heavier than in full-time employment (-12.5%). This was due to a number of factors, including part-time work being more prevalent in industries that were most affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown, namely retail trade and accommodation and food services. Growth in part-time employment has outpaced full-time growth in each of the past three months. With July gains, part-time work is now closer to its pre-COVID level (-5.0%) than full-time employment (-7.5%). The relatively flat growth in full-time work in recent months is reflected in an increase in the proportion of part-time workers doing so involuntarily. In July 2019, 22.2% of those working less than 30 hours per week would have preferred full-time work (not seasonally adjusted). One year later, this proportion had increased 7.6 percentage points to 29.7%, an indication that the COVID-19 economic shutdown and subsequent re-opening has resulted in a reduction, at least temporarily, in the number of hours being offered by employers. Chart 2 Part-time employment closer to pre-COVID level than full-time work Stronger employment gains for women in July, but men continue to be closer to pre-shutdown levels In July, employment rose faster among women (+3.4% or +275,000) than men (+1.5% or +144,000). Due to heavier employment losses among women in March, however, employment in July was closer to its pre-shutdown level for men than for women. As of July, men in the core-age group of 25 to 54, who were least affected by the shutdown, had recovered to within 4.4% of their February employment level. Employment for women in this age group was within 5.7% of pre-COVID levels. Female youth (aged 15 to 24) were the furthest from their February employment level (-17.9%), followed by young men (-16.9%) in the same age group. Chart 3 Employment for women further from pre-shutdown levels (change from February) Employment was little changed in July among both male and female core-aged workers with children under 18 (not adjusted for seasonality). As in June, employment in July was furthest away from pre-shutdown levels among mothers whose youngest child was aged 6 to 17. The number of Canadians working from home continues to fall in July Among those who were employed and not absent from work, the number working from home dropped by 400,000, compared with an increase of 300,000 in the number working at locations other than home. Despite this decline, the number of Canadians who worked from home in July (4.6 million) remained significantly higher than the number who usually do so (1.6 million). Unemployment rate continues to drop from May's record high The unemployment rate was 10.9% in July, falling 1.4 percentage points for the second consecutive month and down from a record high of 13.7% in May. The unemployment rate was 5.6% in February. While the unemployment rate fell among all major age-sex groups in July, it was higher for men (11.3%) than for women (10.4%). The unemployment rate for male youth aged 15 to 24 (26.7%) continued to be higher than that of all other groups, including female youth (21.3%). Among those in the core working age of 25 to 54, the unemployment rate was virtually the same for men (8.8%) and women (8.7%). The number of unemployed people fell for the second consecutive month in July, down 269,000 (-11.0%). Despite this decrease, almost 2.2 million Canadians were unemployed in July, nearly twice as many (+92.6%) as in February (1.1 million). In any given month, the net change in unemployment is the result of the difference between the number of people becoming unemployed and those leaving unemployment, either because they became employed or left the labour force. In July, 1.1 million Canadians moved out of unemployment while 841,000 entered unemployment. The majority of those who left unemployment became employed (63.3%). Chart 4 Unemployment rate continues to fall from May's record high Temporary layoffs continue to decline rapidly while the number of job searchers continues to rise The unemployed include three main groups of people: those on temporary layoff who expect to return to a previous job within six months; those who do not expect to return to a previous job and are looking for work; and those who have arrangements to begin a new job within four weeks. In response to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, unemployment surged from February to April, driven by an increase of 1.1 million in the number of people on temporary layoff. In July, temporary layoffs declined strongly for a second consecutive month, down 384,000 (-45.5%). Among those on temporary layoff in June, approximately half became employed in July, either returning to their old job or starting a new one (not seasonally adjusted). Despite the sharp declines in June and July, the number of people on temporary layoff (460,000) was more than four times higher than it was in February. In July, the number of people searching for work increased 115,000 (+7.1%), mainly the result of people entering the labour force to look for work. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 economic shutdown in March, the number of job searchers has risen by 689,000 (+66.6%), including increases of 331,000 (+58.8%) among core-aged people aged 25 to 54 and 297,000 (+108.5%) among youth aged 15 to 24. Increases were similar for women and men. Chart 5 The number of people looking for work continues to grow, while temporary layoffs decline sharply The number of people who wanted a job but did not search continues to fall From February to April, the number of people who wanted a job but did not meet the definition of unemployed because they did not look for work, likely for reasons related to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, increased by 1.1 million. The number of people in this situation dropped in July (-266,000; -28.0%), falling for the third consecutive month, but still 299,000 (+77.8%) higher compared with the February level. If those who wanted to work but did not look for a job were included as unemployed in July, the adjusted unemployment rate would be 13.8%, a decline of 2.5 percentage points compared with the adjusted rate in June but still higher than the 7.3% recorded in February. Gaps persist in labour force participation rate for women The labour force—the number of people counted as either employed or unemployed—rose 150,000 (+0.8%) in July, the third consecutive monthly increase. Labour force participation increased by 75,000 (+0.7%) among men and 75,000 (+0.8%) among women. The labour force participation rate—the labour force as a proportion of the population aged 15 and older—rose to 64.3% in July, to within 1.2 percentage points of its pre-COVID February level (65.5%). Among core-aged men, the participation rate (90.7%) was within 0.4 percentage points of its February level (91.1%). Among core-aged women, on the other hand, a gap of 1.4 percentage points remains between labour participation rates in February (83.4%) and July (82.0%), an indication that women continue to engage in non-employment-related activities—including caring for children and family members—at a higher rate than prior to COVID-19. Labour underutilization rate continues to decline, falling below 25% Labour underutilization occurs when people who could potentially work are not working or when people could work more hours than they are currently. The ""labour underutilization rate"" combines those who were unemployed, those who were not in the labour force but who wanted a job and did not look for one, and those who were employed but worked less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19. As the economy continued to recover in July, labour underutilization eased. In July, under one-quarter (22.4%) of the potential labour force was fully or partially underutilized. This was down notably from more than one-third in April (36.1%), but substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels (11.2% in February). The rate in July declined at a slower pace than in June, with the largest decline among youth (down 5.8 percentage points to 34.7%), followed by people aged 55 and older (down 4.3 percentage points to 23.3%), and core-aged people (down 4.1 percentage points to 19.5%). While the labour underutilization rate was similar for men and women prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate has been higher for women since February. In July, the gap reduced as the rate fell more for women (-5.4 percentage points to 22.9%) than for men (-3.5 percentage points to 22.0%). New information on labour market conditions for diverse groups of Canadians To address gaps in the understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on population groups designated as visible minorities, two enhancements were made to the LFS in July. First, for respondents interviewed in July and in the future, a new question was added asking respondents aged 15 to 69 to report the population groups to which they belong. This provides the opportunity to measure the current and future labour market conditions of diverse groups but does not provide historical information to determine the possible impacts of COVID-19 prior to July. Second, for all respondents, including those interviewed before July, Statistics Canada developed an experimental method to integrate data from other sources so that population group characteristics could be added to the information collected through direct interviews prior to July. This allows an analysis of the possible impacts of COVID-19 on population groups designated as visible minorities (See Note to readers for more explanation of this methodology). When used in conjunction with labour market information coming from the 2016 Census of Population, LFS information can be used to paint a fuller picture of the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market conditions of diverse groups of Canadians. Unemployment rate in July higher for South Asian, Arab and Black Canadians A key aspect of the COVID-19 economic shutdown and the associated labour market shock has been unprecedented increases in unemployment, including a historically high unemployment rate observed in May (13.7%). After falling for two consecutive months, the unemployment rate in July was 10.9% for the population aged 15 and older. The national unemployment rate disguises significant variation across population groups. When unadjusted for seasonality, the national unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 69 was 11.3% in July. Several groups had rates of joblessness significantly above this average, including South Asian (17.8%), Arab (17.3%), and Black (16.8%) Canadians. Among South Asian Canadians, women (20.4%) had a significantly higher unemployment rate than men (15.4%). Black women also had a higher unemployment rate than Black men (18.6% vs 15.1%). For several population groups—including West Asian, Korean and Japanese Canadians—it was not possible to calculate separate unemployment rates with the current LFS sample size. Among those who were not a member of a population group designated as a visible minority and who did not identify as Aboriginal, the unemployment rate was 9.3% in July (not adjusted for seasonality). Chart 6 South Asian, Arab and Black Canadians had among the highest unemployment rates in July 2020 South Asian and Chinese Canadians experience large COVID-related increases in unemployment Over time, LFS data produced using a new experimental data integration method will be used to examine various aspects of the labour market situation of diverse population groups. Initially, development and refinement of the method has been focused on adding to an understanding of the impact of COVID-19 through a comparison of year-over-year changes in the unemployment rate. Based on data from this method, South Asian (+9.1 percentage points) and Chinese (+8.4 percentage points) Canadians experienced relatively large increases in their unemployment rates from July 2019 to July 2020. The year-over-year increase in the unemployment rate was somewhat lower among Black Canadians (+6.3 percentage points) and Filipino Canadians (+6.2 percentage points). Among Filipino Canadians, the labour participation rate—a measure of the proportion of the population aged 15 and older who are either employed or unemployed—declined by 7.5 percentage points year over year. This suggests that a relatively large proportion of Filipino Canadians who lost employment as a result of COVID-19 have at least temporarily left the labour force rather than looking for new work. The year-over-year unemployment rate increase was the smallest (+4.4 percentage points) among those who were not in a population group designated as a visible minority and who did not identify as an Aboriginal person. Elevated unemployment rates among population groups may reflect disparities in employment by industry The higher July unemployment rate of population groups designated as visible minorities may in part be attributable to their greater concentration as workers in some of the industries hardest hit by the COVID-19 economic shutdown. For example, from February to April, employment in the accommodation and food services industry dropped by 50.0%, more than in any other industry. Based on data from the 2016 Census, the proportion of people employed in this industry was highest among Korean (19.1%), Filipino (14.2%) and Southeast Asian (14.0%) Canadians, compared with 5.9% among those who were not a member of a group designated as a visible minority and did not identify as Aboriginal people. Differences in unemployment rates may also reflect differences within industries in the likelihood of some groups losing employment as a result of COVID-19 and subsequently returning to work. In retail trade, for example, LFS data collected in July show that members of groups designated as visible minorities accounted for a lower proportion of employment in the month (24.6%) than of the pool of people who last worked in retail trade and were unemployed (35.8%). Many Filipino and Black Canadians work in health care and social assistance industry While COVID-19 led to significant job losses and an increase in working from home, many Canadians continued to work at their usual workplace, including in industries, such as health care and social assistance, which entail a high degree of physical proximity to others and a corresponding risk of exposure to COVID-19. Filipino and Black Canadians make a significant contribution to the health care and social assistance industry. Nearly one-quarter (23.6%) of employed Filipino Canadians and one-fifth (20.3%) of employed Black Canadians worked in this industry in July, compared with 13.7% of all workers. For both groups, the importance of health care and social assistance as a source of employment was essentially unchanged from the 2016 Census. Within the health care and social assistance industry, Filipino employees earned an average of $26.86 per hour in July, while Black employees earned $23.36 per hour. Health care and social assistance employees who were not a member of a group designated as a visible minority and not Aboriginal earned an average of $29.90 per hour. Upward trend in employment rate continues in July for very recent immigrants The employment rate among very recent immigrants (five years or less) rose for a third consecutive month in July, up 2.1 percentage points to 60.5%, entirely driven by a decline in the size of this population group (not seasonally adjusted). The month-over-month increase in this group's employment rate was greater than the increases observed among landed immigrants of more than five years (+0.8 percentage points to 54.5%), and those born in Canada (+0.9 percentage points to 59.1%). No employment gain among the Aboriginal population in July In July, employment was unchanged among Aboriginal people living off-reserve, compared with an increase of 1.7% (+284,000) among the non-Aboriginal population (not adjusted for seasonality). In July, employment for this group was at 93.1% of its February level, compared with 95.5% for the non-Aboriginal population. Employment increases in most provinces in July In Ontario, employment rose by 151,000 (+2.2%) in July, building on an increase of 378,000 in June and bringing employment to 91.7% of its pre-pandemic February level. The initial easing of COVID-19 restrictions occurred later in Ontario than in most other provinces. Additional easing was introduced in most regions of the province on July 17, at the end of the LFS reference week. Gains in Ontario employment in July were nearly all in part-time work, while the increase in June was in both full-time and part-time. The proportion of people who were employed but worked less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 was 10.9% in July, down from 14.1% in June. The unemployment rate in Ontario fell by 0.9 percentage points to 11.3% in July. Employment in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto increased by 2.2% in July. This was the same rate of increase as the province, despite the loosening of the COVID-19 restrictions occurring later in the provincial capital than in most other regions. Employment in Toronto reached 89.9% of its February level. Employment in Quebec increased by 98,000 (+2.4%) in July, adding to gains in the previous two months and bringing employment to 94.4% of its pre-COVID level. The increase in employment in July was all in part-time work. The unemployment rate decreased 1.2 percentage to 9.5%, the third consecutive monthly decrease. Employment rose more slowly in the Montréal CMA (+28,000; +1.3%) than in the rest of Quebec and reached 94.4% of its February level. The number of employed British Columbians increased by 70,000 (+3.0%) in July, reaching 93.5% of the February employment level. The proportion of people who were employed but worked less than half of their usual hours was 12.0% in July, down from 14.6% in June. The unemployment rate fell by 1.9 percentage points to 11.1%. In the Vancouver CMA, employment increased by 48,000 (+3.8%) to reach 89.9% of the February level, a degree of recovery lower than the province as a whole. In Alberta, employment increased by 67,000 (+3.2%) in July, including gains in both full-time and part-time work. The unemployment rate for the province fell by 2.7 percentage points in July to 12.8%, the first decline since the COVID-19 economic shutdown. In Saskatchewan, employment rose by 13,000 (+2.5%) while the unemployment rate fell 2.8 percentage points to 8.8%. Employment in Manitoba increased (+12,000) for the third consecutive month and the unemployment rate declined by 1.9 percentage points to 8.2%. Employment in Newfoundland and Labrador increased by 4,300 (+2.1%) in July and the unemployment rate dropped 0.9 percentage points to 15.6%. In Nova Scotia, employment rose by 3,400 (+0.8%) in July, reaching 92.7% of its February level. The unemployment rate in the province declined by 2.2 percentage points to 10.8%. Employment in Prince Edward Island rose by 1,100 in July (+1.5%), adding to the gains in the previous two months. The unemployment rate declined by 3.5 percentage points to 11.7%. In New Brunswick, employment was little changed in July after recording employment gains of 39,000 from April to June. Employment in the province—which was among the first to begin easing COVID-19 restrictions—was at 96.6% of its pre-COVID February level, the most complete employment recovery of all provinces to date. Chart 7 Employment increases in most provinces in July but remains below February levels Monthly employment growth in services sector brings cumulative recovery to same level as goods-producing sector In July, employment increased strongly in the services-producing sector (+348,000; +2.5%), driven by gains in wholesale and retail trade and in accommodation and food services. Growth in the goods-producing sector was more modest (+71,000; +1.9%). With the gains in July, employment in the services sector reached 93.0% of its pre-COVID February level, essentially the same level of recovery as in the goods-producing sector (93.1%). Chart 8 Employment in both service sector and goods-producing sector reaches 93% of pre-COVID levels Despite large gains in July, employment remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels in accommodation and food services In July, as the continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions allowed Canadians to return to restaurants and outdoor patios, employment rose by 101,000 (+12.3%) in accommodation and food services, the third consecutive monthly increase. Despite these gains, employment in the industry was only 74.9% of its February level. In July, part-time employment accounted for 42.9% of overall employment in accommodation and food services (not seasonally adjusted). This was a 5.2 percentage point increase from July 2019, an indication that COVID-19 has resulted in at least a temporary shift in the composition of jobs within this industry. Work tasks in accommodation and food services usually require a high degree of physical proximity, either between co-workers or through interactions with clients. In July, 9 in 10 workers in the industry (88.6%) reported having access to personal protective equipment. Employment recovery in retail trade now on par with the all-industry average The number of people employed in retail trade grew by 91,000 (+4.6%) in July, bringing employment to 92.7% of its February level. Employment in retail was among the industries hardest hit by the initial COVID-19 workplace restrictions, with employment in April falling to 77.2% of its February level. Due to the relatively high proportion of retail trade jobs requiring close physical proximity with others, easing of COVID-19 restrictions was accompanied by important workplace adaptations and other protective measures. In July, 90.9% of workers reported that they or their employer had reorganized the workplace or work practices due to COVID-19. Employment in health care and social assistance only slightly below its pre-COVID-19 level As most provinces continued to ease COVID-19 restrictions in July, including restrictions on non-essential health care services, employment in the health care and social assistance industry increased by 41,000 (+1.7%), reaching 97.5% of its pre-COVID-19 level. Among health care and social assistance workers who were working outside their homes in July, 93.5% reported having access to personal protective equipment. Continued easing of COVID-19 restrictions leads to employment growth in the 'other services' industry, including personal care services Employment in the 'other services' industry increased by 40,000 (+5.8%) in July, bringing employment to 89.3% of its February level. This industry includes personal care services establishments, such as hair and beauty salons, which progressively reopened in many provinces from June to July. First employment increase in professional and technical services following the COVID-19 economic shutdown In July, the number of people employed in professional and technical services—which include computer system design services, and advertising and related services—rose by 33,000 (+2.2%), reaching 97.1% of the February employment level. COVID-19-related employment losses have been relatively small in this industry. Employment levels have hovered around 95% of the February employment level since March. A relatively small proportion of jobs in professional and technical services require close physical proximity with others, and workers in the industry have shifted to working from home on a large scale. The proportion working from home in July (69.1%) continued to exceed the share who usually do so (29.1%) and slightly decreased from June (73.3%) (not seasonally adjusted). Employment continues to rebound in goods-producing industries After avoiding large job losses in the first month of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, both the construction and manufacturing industries experienced heavy losses in April, followed by an initial recovery in May and a large rebound in June. The number of people employed in construction increased by 34,000 (+2.5%) in July, reaching 91.6% of its February level. In the manufacturing industry, employment gains totalled 29,000, bringing employment to 93.6% of its February level. After a decline in June, employment in natural resources rose by 11,000 (+3.7%) in July, bringing employment in the industry to 98.9% of its February level. Employment in agriculture was unchanged from June. Most workers in goods-producing industries reported that they or their employer had put in place measures to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19. While adaptation measures remained relatively less common in agriculture, the proportion of agricultural workers reporting access to personal protective equipment increased to 64.6% in July from 47.8% in June (not seasonally adjusted). Despite gains in July, employment continues to lag among youth, students, and low-wage workers Youth employment grows in July but remains far below pre-COVID levels As the economy continued to reopen in July, employment gains were recorded in industries with higher concentrations of young workers, such as accommodation and food services, and retail trade. As a result, youth (aged 15 to 24) employment rose 6.9% (+135,000) in the month, mainly the result of increases among young women. From February to April, employment among youth decreased by over one-third (-34.2%; -873,000). By July, youth employment was 17.4% less than in February (-445,000), including 17.9% less for young women and 16.9% less for young men. Summer students continue to face challenging labour market conditions Returning students aged 15 to 24—those who were enrolled full-time in March and intend to return in September—continued to face challenging labour market conditions in July. Employment for this group was down 172,000 (-12.8%) on a year-over-year basis, with the decline split between part-time and full-time work (not seasonally adjusted). The situation was somewhat better for returning students than for non-student youth, who recorded a year-over-year decline of 196,000 (-16.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). In July, approximately three-quarters of the employment decline for returning students aged 15 to 24 was recorded in Ontario (-128,000 on a year-over-year basis, not seasonally adjusted), where restrictions were eased later than in other provinces. The employment rate for returning students aged 15 to 24—that is, the proportion of this group who were employed—declined in almost all provinces on a year-over-year basis. The exceptions were Newfoundland and Labrador and in Saskatchewan, where the rate was little changed. In Ontario, the employment rate of returning students was 39.9% in July, down 12.1 percentage points compared with July 2019 and the lowest among the provinces. The highest employment rate among returning students was recorded in Quebec (62.3% in July, down from 67.9% in July 2019) (not seasonally adjusted). Nationally, on a year-over-year basis, the employment rate for youth aged 15 to 24 declined by 8.8 percentage points to 47.1% for returning students, compared with a drop of 10.9 percentage points to 68.1% for non-student youth (not seasonally adjusted). For youth aged 20 to 24, the declines in the employment rate were similar for returning students and non-students (-12.6 percentage points to 56.8% and -10.9 percentage points to 69.9%, respectively, not seasonally adjusted). Chart 9 Notable year-over-year employment rate declines for youth aged 20 to 24 and youth aged 17 to 19 Despite employment gains in July, recovery remains slow among low-wage workers In July, employment increased faster (+8.3%; +213,000) among employees who earned less than $16.03 per hour (two-thirds of the 2019 annual median wage of $24.04/hour) than among other employees (+0.8%; +98,000) (not adjusted for seasonality). Nevertheless, employment relative to February levels remained lower for low-wage employees (85.4%) than for all other paid employees (97.4%) (not adjusted for seasonality). Employment among female low-wage workers reached 81.8% of the pre-COVID level in July, compared with 90.7% for men (not adjusted for seasonality). Canadians continue to receive COVID-19 support benefits More than half of recent CERB recipients were employed in July, but many had reduced hours On July 31, the Government of Canada announced that recipients of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) will soon transition to either Employment Insurance (EI) or a new benefit for those who are not eligible for EI. The July LFS results provide insights into the employment and job search status of recent CERB recipients. As of the LFS collection period of July 19 to 28, just under one in five (18.4%) Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported having received either the CERB, the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), or regular EI benefits in the four weeks before their LFS interview. Among returning students aged 18 to 24, more than one-quarter (27.5%) had received the CESB, while 17.5% had received the CERB. Of those who reported receiving CERB in the four weeks before their interview, more than half (56.2%) were employed during the LFS reference week, including both those who had stopped receiving benefits as of the LFS reference week and those who continued to receive support. More than one-third (38.1%) of the employed CERB recipients worked less than half their usual hours in July, compared with 5.4% of employed non-recipients. Employed CERB recipients occupied jobs where usual weekly earnings—not accounting for these lost hours—averaged $590.46, compared with $1132.86 for non-recipients. Among recent CERB recipients who were not employed in July, about 6 in 10 were unemployed, including 40.6% who were looking for work and a further 15.8% who were on temporary layoff. Those who last worked in the higher-paying group of management occupations were more likely to be looking for work (59.1%) than those who last worked in lower-paid sales and service occupations (32.7%). About 4 in 10 not-employed recent CERB recipients were not in the labour force in July, meaning that they were not looking for work. Among recent CERB recipients in this situation with at least one child under 18 at home, mothers were more likely to be out of the labour force (52.7%) than fathers (40.8%). Little change in proportion of people living in households reporting difficulty meeting financial needs Since April, the LFS has included a supplementary question about difficulty meeting basic household financial needs, such as rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and groceries. In July, the proportion of Canadians living in households reporting such difficulties was little changed at 19.6%. The share has consistently hovered around one in five since April. Looking ahead Canadians express concerns about returning to their usual work location In July, the vast majority (85.8%) of Canadians who had adjusted to COVID-19 by starting to work from home expected that they would continue to do so for the following four weeks. When asked to consider challenges related to eventually returning to their usual work location, more than half (54.5%) were concerned about contracting COVID-19 in the workplace, while nearly half (48.5%) worried about infecting a family member. Just under one-third (31.9%) had concerns about using public transit. Teleworking parents, particularly mothers, concerned about childcare and return to work Based on supplementary LFS questions asked in July, more than one-third (35.6%) of parents with children under 18 years old who have adjusted to COVID-19 by starting to work from home were concerned that returning to their usual work location would involve challenges related to childcare or caregiving. This share was highest among mothers with at least one child under the age of six (56.1%). As COVID-19 public health restrictions continue to evolve in August—and as the re-opening of schools draws nearer—Statistics Canada will continue to measure the recovery of the economy from the unprecedented shutdown of activities that occurred in March and April. In addition to monitoring changes in full-time and part-time employment and absences from work, the LFS will be instrumental in monitoring the pace of recovery by province and industry and in measuring differences in the degree of recovery across diverse groups of Canadians.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for July are for the week of July 12 to 18. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. Since March 2020, all face-to-face interviews were replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both interviewers and respondents. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. In July, approximately 40,000 interviews were completed, about the same number as in June. The distribution of LFS interviews in July 2020 compared with June 2020, was as follows: Personal face-to-face interviews • June 2020 0.0% • July 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from call centres • June 2020 0.0% • July 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • June 2020 69.2% • July 2020 69.4% Online interviews • June 2020 30.8% • July 2020 30.6% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in July 2020 analysis To continue capturing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the supplementary indicators used in April have been slightly adapted in May, June and July. Therefore, they are not directly comparable to the supplementary indicators published in April and March 2020. Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Time-related underemployment rate combines people who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours as a proportion of all employed people. New information on population groups Beginning in July, the LFS includes a question asking respondents to report the population groups to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2016 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Other For LFS records interviewed before July, population group characteristics were assigned using an experimental sample matching data integration method. This involved directly integrating LFS and census information for approximately 20% of LFS records. For the remaining 80%, population group characteristics were assigned using information available at the population level from both LFS and census. Further development of this method will continue in the coming months. According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, data for the population who identify as Aboriginals are analyzed separately. The remaining category is described as ""people not designated as visible minorities"" or ""people who are not a visible minority."" Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Next release The next release of the LFS will be on September 4.

Browse by subject Browse by key resource About StatCan Breadcrumb trail Home The Daily Behind the Data Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions By Susie Fortier and Guy Gellatly, Statistics Canada This special edition article provides nontechnical answers to selected questions related to the use and interpretation of seasonally adjusted data. Organized as a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), it complements the more technical discussions of seasonal adjustment in Statistics Canada publications and reference manuals. This reference document is divided into two sections. Section 1 is a review of concepts and definitions that are central to the theory and practice of seasonal adjustment. Section 2 is a discussion of selected issues that are related to the analysis and interpretation of seasonally adjusted data. Section 1: Concepts and definitions What is a time series? What is a seasonally adjusted time series? Why is seasonal adjustment needed? Is seasonal adjustment always required? How common is seasonal adjustment at Statistics Canada? How are seasonally adjusted data estimated? What are the time series components? Which components are included and excluded in a seasonally adjusted series? Why are raw and seasonally adjusted data revised over time? Do year-over-year comparisons of raw data work as well as more formal seasonal adjustment techniques? Section 2: Issues related to analysis and interpretation How do I interpret period-to-period changes in seasonally adjusted data? How do seasonal patterns affect the interpretation of month-to-month changes? Which estimate—seasonally adjusted or raw—is “correct”? How do I interpret seasonally adjusted data when an industry is undergoing structural change? How does seasonal adjustment account for “unseasonable” weather? What method does Statistics Canada use to produce seasonally adjusted data? Where can I find more information on selected issues? Section 1: Concepts and definitions What is a time series? A time series is a sequence of observations collected at regular time intervals. These data provide information on a well-defined statistical concept for a specific reference period, and are presented at different points in time. Most economic data disseminated by Statistics Canada are presented as a time series. Examples include the monthly data on consumer prices, retail sales, employment and gross domestic product. These data correspond to monthly reference periods that are available for a long sequence of months, to facilitate comparisons over time. What is a seasonally adjusted time series? Monthly or quarterly time series data are sometimes influenced by seasonal and calendar effects. These effects can bring about changes in the data that normally occur at the same time, and in about the same magnitude, every year. For example, monthly retail sales have historically been at their highest level for the year in December as a result of holiday shopping, and then declined to lower levels in January. This occurs year after year and affects the extent to which information on trends in retail industries can be informed by comparing raw sales data for these two months. A seasonally adjusted time series is a monthly or quarterly time series that has been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences. The seasonally adjusted data allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. A raw time series is the equivalent series before seasonal adjustment and is sometimes referred to as the original or unadjusted time series. Why is seasonal adjustment needed? Many users of economic and social statistics rely on time series data to understand changes in socio-economic phenomena over time. Important statistical properties of a time series include its direction and turning points, as well as its relationship to other socio-economic indicators. A seasonal pattern in a series can obscure these important features by making period-to-period movements in the data more difficult to interpret. Many users of time series data do not consider movements in the data that relate to seasonal and other calendar effects to be analytically meaningful. These seasonal and calendar effects can obscure “true” underlying movements in the data series related to the business cycle, or to non-seasonal events, such as strikes or unanticipated disruptions in production. Consequently, seasonal adjustment techniques that remove the effect of seasonal and calendar influences from the original data can sharpen the extent to which a time series can be used to evaluate meaningful changes in economic conditions over time. Is seasonal adjustment always required? Seasonal adjustment may not always be appropriate or required. It is not necessary to seasonally adjust a series that does not exhibit an identifiable seasonal pattern or other calendar-based influences. It is also not always advisable to use seasonally adjusted data when the raw estimate represents the true statistic of interest. For example, decision makers who rely on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for indexation purposes are advised to use unadjusted data—as these reflect the actual price movements observed from period-to-period. However, data users who are more interested in analyzing underlying price trends in the economy are encouraged to use seasonally adjusted indexes. Similarly, analysts who are interested in calculating the raw growth in the number of young adults working from April 2012 to May 2012 should examine the raw estimates for these two months, and calculate the difference. This month-to-month change in raw employment might not yield much useful information about changes in the labour market conditions facing young adults if seasonal or calendar effects have a significant influence on employment levels in either or both months. However, the raw data show the extent to which actual employment for this group grew, or contracted, from April to May—which may be useful information for other purposes. How common is seasonal adjustment at Statistics Canada? Statistics Canada seasonally adjusts almost all of its major sub-annual economic indicators, including quarterly and monthly estimates of gross domestic product, and monthly employment estimates from the Labour Force Survey. Although the vast majority of the agency’s releases highlight seasonally adjusted data, both the seasonally adjusted series and unadjusted series are often made available. How are seasonally adjusted data estimated? Seasonally adjusted data are estimated by breaking down time series data into various components. Using well-established statistical techniques, this process involves decomposing a time series into four separate components: (1) the trend-cycle, (2) seasonal effects, (3) other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays, and (4) the irregular component. The seasonally adjusted series is the original time series with the estimated seasonal and calendar effects removed, or equivalently, the estimated combination of the trend-cycle and the irregular components. What are the time series components? A time series can be split into four separate time series components: (1) the trend-cycle, (2) seasonal effects, (3) other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays, and (4) the irregular component. Here is an overview of each: The trend-cycle: This represents the smoothed version of the time series and indicates its general pattern or direction. The trend-cycle can be interpreted as the long-term movement in the time series, the result of different factors (or determinants) that condition long-run changes in the data over time. As its name suggests, the trend-cycle also reflects periodic expansions and contractions in economic activity, such as those associated with the business cycle. Seasonal effects: These represent regular movements or patterns in time series data that occur in the same month or quarter every year. On the basis of past movements of the time series, these regular patterns repeat themselves from year to year. These seasonal patterns are fairly stable in terms of timing, direction and magnitude. Often these seasonal effects relate to well-established calendar-based variations in economic activity, such as the increase in retail sales in the lead up to Christmas, or increases in construction employment in the spring. Seasonal effects identify these regularly occurring patterns in the data. Other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays: Aside from seasonal effects, other systematic calendar-based effects can influence the level of economic activity in a specific period. The most important of these are the trading-day effects. These effects can be present when the level of economic activity varies depending on the day of the week. For example, retail sales are usually higher on Saturdays than on any other day of the week. Consequently, a five-Saturday month is more likely to result in higher retail sales than a month with only four Saturdays. Another common example of a calendar effect is the date of Easter, which can be expected to increase retail sales in March or April depending on the month in which it occurs. This particular calendar effect is referred to as a moving holiday effect. The irregular component: This component includes unanticipated movements in the data that (1) are not part of the trend-cycle, and (2) are not related to current seasonal factors or calendar effects. The irregular component could relate to unanticipated economic events or shocks (for example, strikes, disruptions, unseasonable weather, etc.), or can simply arise from noise in the measurement of the unadjusted data (due to sampling and non-sampling errors). Which components are included and excluded in a seasonally adjusted series? Seasonal effects and other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays are excluded from seasonally adjusted series. Consequently, the seasonally adjusted series is the combination of the trend-cycle and the irregular component. The contribution of the irregular component is worth emphasizing, because seasonally adjusted data are sometimes misinterpreted as providing users with “pure” information on the trend-cycle. Why are raw and seasonally adjusted data revised over time? The raw data can be revised to take into consideration additional data that were reported late, to correct data that were initially misreported, or for various other reasons. In such cases, the seasonally adjusted data that are based on unadjusted data also need to be revised. Hindsight is very important for time series analysis. Even when the raw series has not been revised, it is often useful to revise the seasonally adjusted data. To estimate the seasonal effects at any given point in time, statisticians use information from previous, current and future observations. Information about future observations is not available in real time, so seasonal adjustment is conducted using previous and current values, along with projected values. These projections are based on a statistical model that uses past information. As new data becomes available, the various time series components can be estimated more accurately. This results in revised, more accurate estimates of the seasonally adjusted data. Periodically, the methods used to estimate time series components for specific data series are also reviewed. Each statistical program at Statistics Canada has its own revision strategy, and schedules are routinely made available to data users in advance of these revisions. Do year-over-year comparisons of raw data work as well as more formal seasonal adjustment techniques? Comparing raw data for the same period in each year provides information on long-term trends and economic cycles, but these comparisons do not necessarily remove all the seasonal patterns from the data. Certain holidays, like Easter, do not fall on the same date or even in the same month from year to year. If the timing of these holidays influences the variable being measured, such as monthly retail sales, raw year-over-year comparisons can be misleading. For example, in 2013, Easter was on March 31st, whereas in 2012, it was on April 8th. Thus, it may be misleading to conclude that the change in sales from March 2012 to March 2013 reflects underlying trends in retail industries, as differences in sales may have been influenced by the timing of the Easter holiday. Similarly, year-over-year comparisons of raw data ignore the trading day effect, which occurs in many series, and can affect the validity of year-over-year comparisons. For example, many businesses generate less output on Saturday and Sunday than during weekdays. In 2011, October began on a Saturday, and included 5 full weekends and 21 weekdays. In 2012, October began on a Monday, and included 4 full weekends and 23 weekdays. A simple year-over-year comparison between these two months will not account for these differences, and could affect the analysis of changes in economic output over time. Even when no other calendar effects are present in the data, comparing the same periods in each year can still be problematic. In general, it can be shown that this type of comparison lacks timeliness for the identification of turning points (the point at which a decreasing series, for example, begins to increase). Comparing a current value with only one past value (the value of the series 12 months before the current reference month) can also be misleading if that particular value is unusual. For example, comparing economic data for British Columbia for February 2011 to data for February 2010 (the month in which the province hosted the Winter Olympics) may not yield useful information about changes in trends. To partially mitigate this effect, data for the current month (February 2011) can be compared with an average of the data for previous Februarys (for example, the past five years). A similar technique can be applied to examine month-to-month movements. For example, the December to January movement of this year could be compared with a historical average of December to January movements for the last five years. Although this method may yield some additional insight, some measure of caution is warranted as it does not take the place of more formal seasonal adjustment techniques. Section 2: Issues related to analysis and interpretation How do I interpret period-to-period changes in seasonally adjusted data? Period-to-period changes in raw data and period-to-period changes in seasonally adjusted data provide different information. To illustrate this, consider hypothetical employment data from a monthly industry survey. Every month, these data are collected and processed to obtain an estimate of total industry employment. This estimate is raw (not seasonally adjusted)—it is a measure of the number of people working in the industry in the reference month, without distinguishing between (or disentangling) the various time series components that contribute to this estimate. Before publication, this estimate of industry employment is seasonally adjusted, to remove the influence of seasonal and calendar effects from the raw data (using current and past information on industry employment). This adjusted estimate is the official estimate of industry employment released in The Daily. An important note about comparisons over time—the difference between the seasonally adjusted employment estimates for two consecutive months cannot be interpreted as the raw difference in the number of people actually working in the industry in these months. The raw difference is the difference in the unadjusted employment estimates obtained directly from the survey. Rather, the difference in the month-to-month seasonally adjusted estimates is a direct measure of the change in the number of people working, after expected changes due to the variation in seasonal employment between these two months are taken into account. The resulting number may be less than the raw difference or it may be more, depending on how seasonal effects are changing from month to month. The example below illustrates the distinction between raw and seasonally adjusted data, using hypothetical employment data for an industry, collected over two consecutive months. In this example, it is assumed that there are no other calendar effects. Table 1 Industry employment, raw and seasonally adjusted Table 1 Industry employment, raw and seasonally adjusted Table summary This table displays the results of Industry employment. The information is grouped by Time Period (appearing as row headers), Unadjusted data, Seasonally adjusted data, Trend cycle, Irregular component and Seasonal effects (appearing as column headers). Time Period Unadjusted data Seasonally adjusted data Trend cycle Irregular component Seasonal effects Persons Month 1 6,200 7,200 6,650 550 -1,000 Month 2 5,400 6,800 6,500 300 -1,400 Change (month 2 minus month 1) -800 -400 -150 -250 -400 Source: Statistics Canada, authors' calculations. In month 1, the unadjusted estimate of industry employment was 6,200; the seasonally adjusted employment estimate was larger, at 7,200. Accordingly, the employment attributed to seasonal effects in month 1 was -1,000. What does this mean? It means that about 1,000 fewer employees were expected to be working in month 1 when compared with a generic average level of industry employment throughout the year. These “expected” and “average” levels are based on historical patterns that reflect typical seasonal movements in these data. Accordingly, these 1,000 fewer employees are added back into the employment estimate for month 1, yielding a seasonally adjusted estimate that is larger than the unadjusted, or raw, estimate collected from the survey. Why is this done? This occurs because the objective of seasonal adjustment is to make the month-to-month data more comparable so that they provide better information about trends and cyclical movements. Seasonally adjusting the data puts month-to-month comparisons on equal footing. The estimate of industry employment for month 2 exhibits a similar pattern, with the final seasonally adjusted estimate exceeding the unadjusted estimate. In this month, 1,400 fewer employees would be expected to be working in the industry (compared with a generic average level of monthly employment throughout the year), based on regularly occurring seasonal movements. Adding this employment back into the unadjusted estimate from the survey data brings the published (seasonally adjusted) estimate to 6,800. Both months are examples of “adding back” – supplementing the survey data with additional employment – because the seasonal effects are negative. In these cases, less employment is expected in the reference month because of past seasonal patterns, so employment has to be added back in to make the data comparable from month to month. For other months, the reverse could apply—because the seasonal factors are positive. In these months, more employees are expected to be working than in the hypothetical average month, so seasonal adjustment removes some employment from the unadjusted data to put these months (in statistical terms) on an equal footing with other months during the year. How do seasonal patterns affect the interpretation of month-to-month changes? The interpretation of month-to-month changes can be complex because it involves some of the more technical aspects of the data modelling used in seasonal adjustment routines. Seasonal patterns can be modelled “additively” or “multiplicatively”. If seasonal patterns are modelled as additive, the extent to which month-to-month changes in employment are being influenced by changes in the seasonal effects can be examined in a fairly straightforward fashion. To see this, consider again the hypothetical employment data used in the example in question 11. Seasonally adjusted employment fell from 7,200 in month 1 to 6,800 in month 2, a net decline of 400 workers. This is different from the unadjusted change calculated directly from the survey data. The unadjusted estimate fell from 6,200 in month 1 to 5,400 in month 2, a net decline of 800 workers, or twice the decline in the seasonally adjusted data. What accounts for the large difference in these two estimates? As noted above, both months had negative seasonal effects. This means that, in view of past patterns of seasonality, lower industry employment is expected in each of the two months when compared with an annual generic monthly average. But the negative seasonal effect in the second month was larger in absolute terms, by some 400 workers. While about 1,000 workers were added to the raw survey data in month 1 to obtain the seasonally adjusted estimate, some 1,400 workers were added back in month 2. Numerically, about 40% of this reduction in the seasonally adjusted estimate can be attributed to changes in the trend-cycle. The remaining 60% is due to the irregular component. Which estimate—seasonally adjusted or raw—is “correct”? Both estimates are correct, as both derive from legitimate statistical processes. The choice of one over the other depends on the purpose of the analysis. If users are interested in estimates of the actual level of industry employment in a particular period (the number of people working), or in the period-to-period changes in these actual employment levels, these estimates can be obtained directly from surveys without any seasonal adjustment. A problem arises when trying to use these unadjusted data to interpret changes in economic conditions. The raw data reflect the combined effect of all components that contributed to the observed level of employment in a monthly or quarterly period. This includes the trend-cycle, the seasonal effects, the other calendar effects and the irregular component. In the example in question 11, it is correct to say that industry employment declined by 800 workers from month 1 to month 2— the decline tabulated directly from the raw data. But it is less appropriate to attribute this decline to specific factors, such cyclical downturns, while ignoring the potential influence of other components, such as routine changes in seasonal hiring patterns, which also contribute to changes in the raw data. The key point is that the choice between seasonally adjusted and raw data is context-driven. It depends on the issue that the data are attempting to inform, and whether period-to-period movements in these data that derive from seasonal influences are relevant to that issue. How do I interpret seasonally adjusted data when an industry is undergoing structural change? This question relates to the reliability of seasonally adjusted data. Two points warrant emphasis: Seasonal effects reflect typical movements in time series data due to established seasonal patterns; Seasonally adjusted data (which remove the seasonal component and the other calendar effects) are influenced by more than changes in the trend-cycle. They are also influenced by irregular events that, in many cases, have a large impact on the resulting estimate. Structural change can refer to situations in which some fundamental aspect of an economy or industry is changing, resulting in new conditions that differ from past norms. These could involve major technological innovations that alter the nature of production. They could also involve more routine changes in hiring patterns in response to new administrative practices. Both of these examples could bring about new seasonal patterns in an industry that contrast with traditional seasonal patterns. How are these reflected in the seasonally adjusted data? In the short run, these shifts would be regarded as irregular movements in the data, to the extent that they deviate suddenly from expected patterns. Over time, these new patterns would become seasonal and gradually incorporated into the historical record, as new time series information on these changes becomes available. This assumes that these changes are becoming a regular feature of the data—and not the result of irregular events or shocks. Accordingly, it can be more difficult to interpret movements in seasonally adjusted data when underlying seasonal patterns are evolving or changing rapidly. In such cases, irregular factors can exert a large impact on seasonally adjusted estimates. How does seasonal adjustment account for “unseasonable” weather? This is a question that relates to a common misconception about seasonally adjusted data—namely, that it is a technique whose sole purpose is to remove the effect of changes in weather or climate from the data. Seasonal adjustment removes the average or anticipated effect of seasonal factors from monthly or quarterly data, many of which have to do with changes in weather or climate. But it is more accurate to state that these seasonal factors relate to all things seasonal—weather and climate-related or otherwise—that have the potential to affect the analysis of trend or cyclical patterns in the data. The idea of the “average” effect noted earlier is important, as the magnitude of these period-specific seasonal adjustments are again based on historical patterns. If weather or climate conditions are generally reflective of these past patterns, the seasonal adjustment routines can be expected to do a fairly complete job of factoring out movements in the unadjusted data that are attributable to these weather or climate changes. But unseasonable weather, such as the very warm spring in eastern Canada in 2012, is, by definition, not indicative of the average pattern, and will influence seasonally adjusted estimates. What method does Statistics Canada use to produce seasonally adjusted data? Statistics Canada seasonally adjusts sub-annual time series data using the X-12-ARIMA method, which uses well-established statistical techniques to remove the effect of regular, calendar-related patterns from unadjusted data. Although less complex alternatives may be used, such as comparing the original data in the same period in each year, these techniques have limitations when it comes to removing calendar effects. Accordingly, Statistics Canada recommends the use of formal, established methods for dealing with seasonality. In practice, seasonal adjustment is performed following Statistics Canada Quality Guidelines. Where can I find more information on selected issues? As mentioned at the start, this document is intended as a practical guide that provides users with additional perspective on issues related to the use and interpretation of seasonally adjusted data. It is designed to complement a paper by Wyman (2010), who illustrated many of these points with Statistics Canada data. In addition, the extensive literature on seasonal adjustment can provide readers with a fuller examination of the issues discussed in this document. References Ladiray, D. and Quenneville B.

What method does Statistics Canada use to produce seasonally adjusted data? Where can I find more information on selected issues? Section 1: Concepts and definitions What is a time series? A time series is a sequence of observations collected at regular time intervals. These data provide information on a well-defined statistical concept for a specific reference period, and are presented at different points in time. Most economic data disseminated by Statistics Canada are presented as a time series. Examples include the monthly data on consumer prices, retail sales, employment and gross domestic product. These data correspond to monthly reference periods that are available for a long sequence of months, to facilitate comparisons over time. What is a seasonally adjusted time series? Monthly or quarterly time series data are sometimes influenced by seasonal and calendar effects. These effects can bring about changes in the data that normally occur at the same time, and in about the same magnitude, every year. For example, monthly retail sales have historically been at their highest level for the year in December as a result of holiday shopping, and then declined to lower levels in January. This occurs year after year and affects the extent to which information on trends in retail industries can be informed by comparing raw sales data for these two months. A seasonally adjusted time series is a monthly or quarterly time series that has been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences. The seasonally adjusted data allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. A raw time series is the equivalent series before seasonal adjustment and is sometimes referred to as the original or unadjusted time series. Why is seasonal adjustment needed? Many users of economic and social statistics rely on time series data to understand changes in socio-economic phenomena over time. Important statistical properties of a time series include its direction and turning points, as well as its relationship to other socio-economic indicators. A seasonal pattern in a series can obscure these important features by making period-to-period movements in the data more difficult to interpret. Many users of time series data do not consider movements in the data that relate to seasonal and other calendar effects to be analytically meaningful. These seasonal and calendar effects can obscure “true” underlying movements in the data series related to the business cycle, or to non-seasonal events, such as strikes or unanticipated disruptions in production. Consequently, seasonal adjustment techniques that remove the effect of seasonal and calendar influences from the original data can sharpen the extent to which a time series can be used to evaluate meaningful changes in economic conditions over time. Is seasonal adjustment always required? Seasonal adjustment may not always be appropriate or required. It is not necessary to seasonally adjust a series that does not exhibit an identifiable seasonal pattern or other calendar-based influences. It is also not always advisable to use seasonally adjusted data when the raw estimate represents the true statistic of interest. For example, decision makers who rely on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for indexation purposes are advised to use unadjusted data—as these reflect the actual price movements observed from period-to-period. However, data users who are more interested in analyzing underlying price trends in the economy are encouraged to use seasonally adjusted indexes. Similarly, analysts who are interested in calculating the raw growth in the number of young adults working from April 2012 to May 2012 should examine the raw estimates for these two months, and calculate the difference. This month-to-month change in raw employment might not yield much useful information about changes in the labour market conditions facing young adults if seasonal or calendar effects have a significant influence on employment levels in either or both months. However, the raw data show the extent to which actual employment for this group grew, or contracted, from April to May—which may be useful information for other purposes. How common is seasonal adjustment at Statistics Canada? Statistics Canada seasonally adjusts almost all of its major sub-annual economic indicators, including quarterly and monthly estimates of gross domestic product, and monthly employment estimates from the Labour Force Survey. Although the vast majority of the agency’s releases highlight seasonally adjusted data, both the seasonally adjusted series and unadjusted series are often made available. How are seasonally adjusted data estimated? Seasonally adjusted data are estimated by breaking down time series data into various components. Using well-established statistical techniques, this process involves decomposing a time series into four separate components: (1) the trend-cycle, (2) seasonal effects, (3) other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays, and (4) the irregular component. The seasonally adjusted series is the original time series with the estimated seasonal and calendar effects removed, or equivalently, the estimated combination of the trend-cycle and the irregular components. What are the time series components? A time series can be split into four separate time series components: (1) the trend-cycle, (2) seasonal effects, (3) other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays, and (4) the irregular component. Here is an overview of each: The trend-cycle: This represents the smoothed version of the time series and indicates its general pattern or direction. The trend-cycle can be interpreted as the long-term movement in the time series, the result of different factors (or determinants) that condition long-run changes in the data over time. As its name suggests, the trend-cycle also reflects periodic expansions and contractions in economic activity, such as those associated with the business cycle. Seasonal effects: These represent regular movements or patterns in time series data that occur in the same month or quarter every year. On the basis of past movements of the time series, these regular patterns repeat themselves from year to year. These seasonal patterns are fairly stable in terms of timing, direction and magnitude. Often these seasonal effects relate to well-established calendar-based variations in economic activity, such as the increase in retail sales in the lead up to Christmas, or increases in construction employment in the spring. Seasonal effects identify these regularly occurring patterns in the data. Other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays: Aside from seasonal effects, other systematic calendar-based effects can influence the level of economic activity in a specific period. The most important of these are the trading-day effects. These effects can be present when the level of economic activity varies depending on the day of the week. For example, retail sales are usually higher on Saturdays than on any other day of the week. Consequently, a five-Saturday month is more likely to result in higher retail sales than a month with only four Saturdays. Another common example of a calendar effect is the date of Easter, which can be expected to increase retail sales in March or April depending on the month in which it occurs. This particular calendar effect is referred to as a moving holiday effect. The irregular component: This component includes unanticipated movements in the data that (1) are not part of the trend-cycle, and (2) are not related to current seasonal factors or calendar effects. The irregular component could relate to unanticipated economic events or shocks (for example, strikes, disruptions, unseasonable weather, etc.), or can simply arise from noise in the measurement of the unadjusted data (due to sampling and non-sampling errors). Which components are included and excluded in a seasonally adjusted series? Seasonal effects and other calendar effects such as trading days and moving holidays are excluded from seasonally adjusted series. Consequently, the seasonally adjusted series is the combination of the trend-cycle and the irregular component. The contribution of the irregular component is worth emphasizing, because seasonally adjusted data are sometimes misinterpreted as providing users with “pure” information on the trend-cycle. Why are raw and seasonally adjusted data revised over time? The raw data can be revised to take into consideration additional data that were reported late, to correct data that were initially misreported, or for various other reasons. In such cases, the seasonally adjusted data that are based on unadjusted data also need to be revised. Hindsight is very important for time series analysis. Even when the raw series has not been revised, it is often useful to revise the seasonally adjusted data. To estimate the seasonal effects at any given point in time, statisticians use information from previous, current and future observations. Information about future observations is not available in real time, so seasonal adjustment is conducted using previous and current values, along with projected values. These projections are based on a statistical model that uses past information. As new data becomes available, the various time series components can be estimated more accurately. This results in revised, more accurate estimates of the seasonally adjusted data. Periodically, the methods used to estimate time series components for specific data series are also reviewed. Each statistical program at Statistics Canada has its own revision strategy, and schedules are routinely made available to data users in advance of these revisions. Do year-over-year comparisons of raw data work as well as more formal seasonal adjustment techniques? Comparing raw data for the same period in each year provides information on long-term trends and economic cycles, but these comparisons do not necessarily remove all the seasonal patterns from the data. Certain holidays, like Easter, do not fall on the same date or even in the same month from year to year. If the timing of these holidays influences the variable being measured, such as monthly retail sales, raw year-over-year comparisons can be misleading. For example, in 2013, Easter was on March 31st, whereas in 2012, it was on April 8th. Thus, it may be misleading to conclude that the change in sales from March 2012 to March 2013 reflects underlying trends in retail industries, as differences in sales may have been influenced by the timing of the Easter holiday. Similarly, year-over-year comparisons of raw data ignore the trading day effect, which occurs in many series, and can affect the validity of year-over-year comparisons. For example, many businesses generate less output on Saturday and Sunday than during weekdays. In 2011, October began on a Saturday, and included 5 full weekends and 21 weekdays. In 2012, October began on a Monday, and included 4 full weekends and 23 weekdays. A simple year-over-year comparison between these two months will not account for these differences, and could affect the analysis of changes in economic output over time. Even when no other calendar effects are present in the data, comparing the same periods in each year can still be problematic. In general, it can be shown that this type of comparison lacks timeliness for the identification of turning points (the point at which a decreasing series, for example, begins to increase). Comparing a current value with only one past value (the value of the series 12 months before the current reference month) can also be misleading if that particular value is unusual. For example, comparing economic data for British Columbia for February 2011 to data for February 2010 (the month in which the province hosted the Winter Olympics) may not yield useful information about changes in trends. To partially mitigate this effect, data for the current month (February 2011) can be compared with an average of the data for previous Februarys (for example, the past five years). A similar technique can be applied to examine month-to-month movements. For example, the December to January movement of this year could be compared with a historical average of December to January movements for the last five years. Although this method may yield some additional insight, some measure of caution is warranted as it does not take the place of more formal seasonal adjustment techniques. Section 2: Issues related to analysis and interpretation How do I interpret period-to-period changes in seasonally adjusted data? Period-to-period changes in raw data and period-to-period changes in seasonally adjusted data provide different information. To illustrate this, consider hypothetical employment data from a monthly industry survey. Every month, these data are collected and processed to obtain an estimate of total industry employment. This estimate is raw (not seasonally adjusted)—it is a measure of the number of people working in the industry in the reference month, without distinguishing between (or disentangling) the various time series components that contribute to this estimate. Before publication, this estimate of industry employment is seasonally adjusted, to remove the influence of seasonal and calendar effects from the raw data (using current and past information on industry employment). This adjusted estimate is the official estimate of industry employment released in The Daily. An important note about comparisons over time—the difference between the seasonally adjusted employment estimates for two consecutive months cannot be interpreted as the raw difference in the number of people actually working in the industry in these months. The raw difference is the difference in the unadjusted employment estimates obtained directly from the survey. Rather, the difference in the month-to-month seasonally adjusted estimates is a direct measure of the change in the number of people working, after expected changes due to the variation in seasonal employment between these two months are taken into account. The resulting number may be less than the raw difference or it may be more, depending on how seasonal effects are changing from month to month. The example below illustrates the distinction between raw and seasonally adjusted data, using hypothetical employment data for an industry, collected over two consecutive months. In this example, it is assumed that there are no other calendar effects. Table 1 Industry employment, raw and seasonally adjusted Table 1 Industry employment, raw and seasonally adjusted Table summary This table displays the results of Industry employment.

In month 1, the unadjusted estimate of industry employment was 6,200; the seasonally adjusted employment estimate was larger, at 7,200. Accordingly, the employment attributed to seasonal effects in month 1 was -1,000. What does this mean? It means that about 1,000 fewer employees were expected to be working in month 1 when compared with a generic average level of industry employment throughout the year. These “expected” and “average” levels are based on historical patterns that reflect typical seasonal movements in these data. Accordingly, these 1,000 fewer employees are added back into the employment estimate for month 1, yielding a seasonally adjusted estimate that is larger than the unadjusted, or raw, estimate collected from the survey.

The unadjusted estimate fell from 6,200 in month 1 to 5,400 in month 2, a net decline of 800 workers, or twice the decline in the seasonally adjusted data. What accounts for the large difference in these two estimates? As noted above, both months had negative seasonal effects. This means that, in view of past patterns of seasonality, lower industry employment is expected in each of the two months when compared with an annual generic monthly average. But the negative seasonal effect in the second month was larger in absolute terms, by some 400 workers. While about 1,000 workers were added to the raw survey data in month 1 to obtain the seasonally adjusted estimate, some 1,400 workers were added back in month 2. Numerically, about 40% of this reduction in the seasonally adjusted estimate can be attributed to changes in the trend-cycle. The remaining 60% is due to the irregular component. Which estimate—seasonally adjusted or raw—is “correct”? Both estimates are correct, as both derive from legitimate statistical processes. The choice of one over the other depends on the purpose of the analysis. If users are interested in estimates of the actual level of industry employment in a particular period (the number of people working), or in the period-to-period changes in these actual employment levels, these estimates can be obtained directly from surveys without any seasonal adjustment. A problem arises when trying to use these unadjusted data to interpret changes in economic conditions. The raw data reflect the combined effect of all components that contributed to the observed level of employment in a monthly or quarterly period. This includes the trend-cycle, the seasonal effects, the other calendar effects and the irregular component. In the example in question 11, it is correct to say that industry employment declined by 800 workers from month 1 to month 2— the decline tabulated directly from the raw data. But it is less appropriate to attribute this decline to specific factors, such cyclical downturns, while ignoring the potential influence of other components, such as routine changes in seasonal hiring patterns, which also contribute to changes in the raw data. The key point is that the choice between seasonally adjusted and raw data is context-driven. It depends on the issue that the data are attempting to inform, and whether period-to-period movements in these data that derive from seasonal influences are relevant to that issue. How do I interpret seasonally adjusted data when an industry is undergoing structural change? This question relates to the reliability of seasonally adjusted data. Two points warrant emphasis: Seasonal effects reflect typical movements in time series data due to established seasonal patterns; Seasonally adjusted data (which remove the seasonal component and the other calendar effects) are influenced by more than changes in the trend-cycle. They are also influenced by irregular events that, in many cases, have a large impact on the resulting estimate. Structural change can refer to situations in which some fundamental aspect of an economy or industry is changing, resulting in new conditions that differ from past norms. These could involve major technological innovations that alter the nature of production. They could also involve more routine changes in hiring patterns in response to new administrative practices. Both of these examples could bring about new seasonal patterns in an industry that contrast with traditional seasonal patterns. How are these reflected in the seasonally adjusted data? In the short run, these shifts would be regarded as irregular movements in the data, to the extent that they deviate suddenly from expected patterns. Over time, these new patterns would become seasonal and gradually incorporated into the historical record, as new time series information on these changes becomes available. This assumes that these changes are becoming a regular feature of the data—and not the result of irregular events or shocks. Accordingly, it can be more difficult to interpret movements in seasonally adjusted data when underlying seasonal patterns are evolving or changing rapidly. In such cases, irregular factors can exert a large impact on seasonally adjusted estimates. How does seasonal adjustment account for “unseasonable” weather? This is a question that relates to a common misconception about seasonally adjusted data—namely, that it is a technique whose sole purpose is to remove the effect of changes in weather or climate from the data. Seasonal adjustment removes the average or anticipated effect of seasonal factors from monthly or quarterly data, many of which have to do with changes in weather or climate. But it is more accurate to state that these seasonal factors relate to all things seasonal—weather and climate-related or otherwise—that have the potential to affect the analysis of trend or cyclical patterns in the data. The idea of the “average” effect noted earlier is important, as the magnitude of these period-specific seasonal adjustments are again based on historical patterns. If weather or climate conditions are generally reflective of these past patterns, the seasonal adjustment routines can be expected to do a fairly complete job of factoring out movements in the unadjusted data that are attributable to these weather or climate changes. But unseasonable weather, such as the very warm spring in eastern Canada in 2012, is, by definition, not indicative of the average pattern, and will influence seasonally adjusted estimates. What method does Statistics Canada use to produce seasonally adjusted data? Statistics Canada seasonally adjusts sub-annual time series data using the X-12-ARIMA method, which uses well-established statistical techniques to remove the effect of regular, calendar-related patterns from unadjusted data. Although less complex alternatives may be used, such as comparing the original data in the same period in each year, these techniques have limitations when it comes to removing calendar effects. Accordingly, Statistics Canada recommends the use of formal, established methods for dealing with seasonality. In practice, seasonal adjustment is performed following Statistics Canada Quality Guidelines. Where can I find more information on selected issues? As mentioned at the start, this document is intended as a practical guide that provides users with additional perspective on issues related to the use and interpretation of seasonally adjusted data. It is designed to complement a paper by Wyman (2010), who illustrated many of these points with Statistics Canada data. In addition, the extensive literature on seasonal adjustment can provide readers with a fuller examination of the issues discussed in this document. References Ladiray, D. and Quenneville B.

Highlights Prices rose in five of the eight major components on a year-over-year basis in August. Chart 2 Prices rise in five of eight major components Gas prices down in August Gas prices were down 11.1% in August on a year-over-year basis, following a 14.9% decrease in July. The more moderate year-over-year price decline in August stemmed from weaker gas prices in August 2019, when gas prices declined as result of higher production and softer international demand. Infographic 1 Gas prices down in August Prices up for personal care services Year over year, prices for personal care services increased 7.2% in August. This increase was mainly attributable to higher prices for haircuts and hairdressing as increased costs related to safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were passed along to consumers. Air transportation prices fall for the second consecutive month Air transportation prices fell 16.0% year over year in August, following an 8.6% decline in July. Demand for air travel has fallen during the pandemic and airlines continue to offer travel discounts to encourage a return to travel. Chart 3 Air transportation prices fall for the second consecutive month Jewellery prices rise on higher gold prices Jewellery prices rose 6.8% on a year-over-year basis in August, the highest yearly increase since July 2016, amid record-high commodity prices for gold. Passenger vehicle prices grow at a slower pace with higher rebates Year over year, the price increase for purchase of passenger vehicles was lower in August (+2.2%) than in July (+3.2%), mainly the result of higher rebates in August 2020 compared with August 2019. Beef price growth slows for the second consecutive month Year-over-year price growth for fresh or frozen beef (+4.8%) slowed as prices continued to fall from a 21.6% year-over-year increase in June 2020, when reduced production impacted supply and contributed to higher beef prices. By August, beef prices had returned to levels near those at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March. Infographic 2 Beef price growth slows for the second consecutive month Regional highlights Prices rose in five provinces on a year-over-year basis in August. Prices accelerated the most in Prince Edward Island, where consumers paid more for cigarettes (+7.8%) year over year in August following a provincial cigarette tax increase instated in mid-July.

In August, measures remained in place across much of the country to restrict gatherings and the movement of people. In-person field collection continued to be conducted via telephone or Internet for health and safety reasons, supplementing prices collected via web scraping, transaction data and administrative data. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on product availability in the month of August 2020, select sub-components of the CPI received temporary special imputations. Goods and services in the CPI which were not available to consumers in August due to COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, effectively removing their impact on the monthly CPI. The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the All-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, and recreational services. Consistent with previous months affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for suspended flights are excluded from the August CPI calculation because passengers were ultimately unable to consume them. As a result, select sub-components of the air transportation index were imputed from the parent index. Where prices were missing due to high levels of out-of-stock products or the temporary closure of businesses, they were imputed with the average price movement of available prices for those items. A document entitled ""Technical Supplement for the August 2020 Consumer Price Index"" is available in the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M) publication, with further details on the imputations used to compile the August 2020 CPI.

Context: COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease The September Labour Force Survey (LFS) results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of September 13 to 19. At the beginning of September, as Canadian families adapted to new back-to-school routines, public health restrictions had been substantially eased across the country and many businesses and workplaces had re-opened. Throughout the month, some restrictions were re-imposed in response to increases in the number of COVID-19 cases. In British Columbia, new rules and guidelines related to bars and restaurants were implemented on September 8. In Ontario, limits on social gatherings were tightened for the hot spots of Toronto, Peel and Ottawa on September 17 and for the rest of the province on September 19. Assessing the labour market as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions continues This LFS release continues to integrate the international standard concepts such as employment and unemployment with supplementary indicators that help to monitor the labour market as restrictions are lifted and capture the full scope of the impacts of COVID-19. A series of survey enhancements were continued in September, including supplementary questions on working from home, workplace adaptations, financial capacity, concerns related to returning to usual workplaces and receipt of federal COVID-19 support payments. This release also includes, for the third consecutive month, information on the labour market conditions of population groups designated as visible minorities. Through the addition of a new survey question and the introduction of new statistical methods, the LFS is now able to more fully determine the impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown on diverse groups of Canadians. Data from the LFS are based on a sample of more than 50,000 households. Statistics Canada continued to protect the health and safety of Canadians in September by adjusting the processes involved in survey operations. We are deeply grateful to the many Canadians who responded to the survey. Their ongoing cooperation ensures that we continue to paint an accurate and current portrait of the Canadian labour market and Canada's economic performance. Highlights Employment rose by 378,000 (+2.1%) in September, bringing employment to within 720,000 (-3.7%) of its pre-COVID February level Most of the employment increase in September was in full-time work, which rose by 334,000 (+2.1%), building on gains of 206,000 (+1.4%) in August. The number of Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 fell by 108,000 (-7.1%) in September. Among Canadians who worked most of their usual hours, the proportion working from home edged down from August to September, from 26.4% to 25.6%. Employment increased in every province except New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in September, with the largest gains in Ontario and Quebec. Self-employment was little changed in September. Compared with February, self-employment was down 6.0%, while the number of employees was within 3.3% of its pre-pandemic level. Employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) increased for the fifth consecutive month (+134,000; +2.3%) in September, outpacing core-age men. The increase was split between full-time and part-time work. Employment for this group was within 2.1% of pre-COVID employment levels—the closest of the major demographic groups. Employment among core-age men rose by 61,000 (+1.0%) in September, driven by full-time gains. This brought core aged men to within 2.4% of their pre-COVID employment level. For both mothers (+0.9%) and fathers (+1.5%), September employment was on par with pre-pandemic levels (not seasonally adjusted). Employment growth was strong for young women (+62,000 or +5.7%) and men (+66,000 or +6.0%) aged 15 to 24 in September. Despite these increases, employment for Canadian youth remained 10% below February levels, much further behind the recovery in the other major demographic groups. Compared with September 2019, the number of low-wage employees was down by more than one-fifth (-761,000) in September 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate declined for the fourth consecutive month in September, falling 1.2 percentage points to 9.0% There were 1.8 million unemployed Canadians in September, down 214,000 (-10.5%) from August and continuing the four-month downward trend from the record-high 2.6 million unemployed people in May. The majority of unemployed people (approximately 1.5 million) were looking for work. The number of people who wanted to work but did not search for a job (580,000) has been trending downward since peaking at 1.5 million in April. The unemployment rate of Black Canadians dropped 5.9 percentage points to 11.7% in September, while the rate for Filipino Canadians declined by 4.2 percentage points to 8.5%. The unemployment rate for male youth aged 15 to 24 remained the highest among all major demographic groups at 20.5% in September, although it was down 5.1 percentage points from August. Employment continued to increase in both the services-producing (+2.1%) and the goods-producing (+2.0%) sectors in September In services, monthly gains were led by accommodation and food services (+72,000), educational services (+68,000) as well as information, culture and recreation (+56,000). In the goods sector, employment gains were largest in manufacturing (+68,000). Employment was 3.6% below its pre-COVID February level in the services sector, and 4.3% below in the goods-producing sector. Compared with February, total employment was down 720,000 (-3.7%), with three-quarters of this decline coming from four industries: accommodation and food services, retail trade, construction, and transportation and warehousing. While some industries face a long recovery to pre-COVID employment levels, some sectors, including manufacturing, have almost fully recovered. Employment in September is higher than it was in February in educational services. The proportion of Canadians receiving Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) or regular Employment Insurance payments fell from 16.1% in August to 13.5% in September One in five (21.8%) CERB recipients in September were either currently self-employed or had been self-employed in the last 12 months. Employment growth accelerates in September Following an increase of 246,000 (+1.4%) in August, employment rose by 378,000 (+2.1%) in September. The unemployment rate declined 1.2 percentage points to 9.0% in September, down from the peak of 13.7% in May. September gains brought employment to within 720,000 (-3.7%) of its pre-COVID February level. The accommodation and food services (-188,000) and retail trade (-146,000) industries remained furthest from full recovery, while youth employment was 263,000 (-10.3%) below February levels. The number of Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 fell by 108,000 (-7.1%) in September. Combined with the declines from May to August, this left COVID-related absences from work at 605,000 (+74.9%) above February levels. During the September 13 to 19 reference week, the total number of Canadian workers affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown stood at 1.3 million. In April, this number peaked at 5.5 million, including a 3.0 million drop in employment and a COVID-related increase of 2.5 million absences from work. Chart 1 Strong employment growth in September The share of Canadians working from home edges down Among Canadians who worked most of their usual hours, the proportion working from home edged down in September, from 26.4% to 25.6%. Consistent with typical seasonal patterns, the number of Canadians working their usual hours increased notably, with increases among both those working from home (+300,000) and those working at locations other than home (+1.4 million). A large number of Canadians continued to adapt to COVID-19 by working remotely in September, with over twice as many people working from home (4.2 million) than those who usually do so (1.9 million). The transition to working from home has involved new challenges in terms of job demands and balancing work and family life. In September, employees who worked at least half their usual hours and who worked from home worked longer hours on average per week (37.6 hours) than their counterparts who worked outside the home (35.6 hours). Employees working from home also worked more unpaid overtime on average (1.6 hours) than employees working outside the home (0.7 hours). Employment growth concentrated in full-time work Most of the employment increase in September was in full-time work, which rose by 334,000 (+2.1%), building on gains of 206,000 (+1.4%) in August. The number of part-time workers grew at a slower pace in September (+44,000; +1.3%), following virtually no change in August. More than one in five part-time workers (22.7%) wanted full-time work but were unable to find it, an increase of 3.4 percentage points from 12 months earlier. Self-employment unchanged in September For self-employed Canadians, the labour market impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown and subsequent re-opening have been different than for employees. From February to April, employment losses were less pronounced for the self-employed (-79,000; -2.7%) than for employees (-2.9 million; -18.0%). As total employment rebounded from April to September, the number of self-employed workers initially remained flat before declining in August. Self-employment was little changed in September. Compared with February, self-employment was down 6.0%, while the number of employees was within 3.3% of its pre-pandemic level. In addition, the self-employed continued to experience a larger drop in hours than employees. On a year-over-year basis, the total number of hours worked by self-employed workers was down 17.4%, compared with 3.9% for employees. Chart 2 No recovery in self-employment Unemployment rate continues to fall The unemployment rate declined for the fourth consecutive month in September, falling 1.2 percentage points to 9.0%. As a result of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the unemployment rate more than doubled from 5.6% in February to a record high 13.7% in May. By way of comparison, during the 2008/2009 recession, the unemployment rate rose from 6.2% in October 2008 to peak at 8.7% in June 2009. It then took approximately nine years to return to its pre-recession rate. Infographic 1 Unemployment rate continues to fall from May's record high There were 1.8 million unemployed Canadians in September, down 214,000 (-10.5%) from August and continuing the four-month downward trend from the record-high 2.6 million unemployed people in May. The majority of unemployed people (approximately 1.5 million) were job searchers, while 363,000 Canadians were either on temporary layoff, and expected to return to a previous job within six months, or had arrangements to begin a new job within four weeks. In any given month, the net change in unemployment is the difference between the number of people becoming unemployed and those leaving unemployment, either because they became employed or left the labour force. In September, more than half of those who left unemployment became employed (57.3%), while over half of those who became unemployed in September (59.4%) had been out of the labour force in August. Unemployment rate falls for Black Canadians but remains higher than average From August to September, the unemployment rate for 15- to 69-year-olds declined among six of the seven largest population groups designated as visible minorities for which reliable estimates could be produced using the current LFS sample size (not seasonally adjusted). There was little change in the unemployment rate of Arab Canadians. Chart 3 Unemployment rate falls for Black Canadians but remains higher than the average The unemployment rate of Black Canadians dropped 5.9 percentage points to 11.7% in September, while the rate for Filipino Canadians declined by 4.2 percentage points to 8.5% (not seasonally adjusted). Canadians who did not identify as Indigenous and who were not a visible minority continued to have the lowest unemployment rate in September (7.0%), while Arab Canadians (16.3%) had the highest unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted). The decrease in the unemployment rate among Black Canadians in September was mainly attributable to employment gains and lower unemployment in sales and service occupations, as well as in occupations in education, law and social, community and government services. Ontario accounted for nearly 80% of net employment gains within the Black population. Labour underutilization continues to fall The number of people who wanted to work but did not search for a job was down in September (-77,000; -11.8%). If people in this group were included as unemployed, the adjusted unemployment rate would be 11.9%. The overall number of people who wanted to work but did not search for a job (580,000) has been trending downward since peaking at 1.5 million in April. Labour underutilization occurs when people who could potentially work are not working, or when people could work more hours than they are currently. The ""labour underutilization rate"" combines those who were unemployed, those who were not in the labour force but who wanted a job and did not look for one, and those who were employed but worked less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to the pandemic. The labour underutilization rate peaked at 36.1% in April and has trended downward ever since. In September, as the economy continued to recover, the labour underutilization rate fell from 20.3% in August to 18.3%, but still remained well above pre-pandemic levels (11.2% in February). Employment increases in both goods-producing and services-producing sectors Employment continued to increase in both the services-producing (+303,000; +2.1%) and the goods-producing (+75,000; +2.0%) sectors in September. In services, monthly gains were led by accommodation and food services (+72,000), educational services (+68,000) as well as information, culture and recreation (+56,000). In the goods sector, employment gains were largest in manufacturing (+68,000). As the Canadian economy continues to recover and adapt to the impacts of COVID-19, some industries face a longer path to recovery than others. Compared with February, total employment in September was down 720,000 (-3.7%), with three-quarters of this decline coming from four industries: accommodation and food services, retail trade, construction, and transportation and warehousing. Chart 4 Employment in accommodation and food services, retail trade and construction furthest from pre-shutdown levels Employment continues to recover in accommodation and food services but stalls in retail trade Employment in accommodation and food services rose by 72,000 (+7.4%) in September. This was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and brought total gains since the initial easing of COVID-19 restrictions in May to 427,000. Nevertheless, employment in this industry was the furthest from recovery in September, down 15.3% (-188,000) from its pre-pandemic February level. The accommodation and food services industry is likely to continue to face a number of challenges over the coming months. While outdoor dining is likely to become impractical during the winter months and as some COVID restrictions are re-introduced, a recent study indicated that Canadians plan to reduce spending at restaurants (see Expected changes in spending habits during the recovery period). Following four months of increases, employment in retail trade held steady in September. Compared with February, employment in this industry was down by 146,000 (-6.4%). After increasing sharply in May and June, following the initial easing of COVID-19 restrictions, retail sales slowed markedly in July. In construction, long road to recovery remains Employment in construction remained little changed for the second consecutive month in September, and was down by 120,000 (-8.1%) compared with its pre-COVID level. Compared with February, employment in construction was down the most in Ontario (-54,000; -9.5%) and British Columbia (-39,000; -16.3%). Construction consists of three subsectors: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. According to the latest results from the Survey of Employment Payrolls and Hours, employment in construction fell from February to July in each of these subsectors, with the largest decline among specialty trade contractors. Results from the release of investment in building construction for July showed that investment in building construction was slightly lower in July than in February. Employment in transportation and warehousing recovers modestly in September The number of people employed in transportation and warehousing rose by 23,000 (+2.5%) in September, the first notable increase since June. Employment in this industry declined by 82,000 (-8.0%) compared with February. The employment decline since February in the transportation and warehousing industry is consistent with a number of indicators showing that transportation has faced particular challenges in recovering from the COVID-19 economic shutdown. For example, results from the monthly civil aviation statistics program show that major Canadian airlines faced an 89.5% drop in passenger demand from July 2019 to July 2020. Similarly, data from the urban public transit statistics program show that the number of public transit passengers fell by 65.5% year over year in July. Manufacturing employment almost fully recovered, but lagging behind in Alberta While some industries face a long recovery to pre-COVID employment levels, some sectors—including manufacturing—have almost fully recovered. The pace of employment growth in manufacturing picked up in September (+68,000; +4.1%), following two months of modest growth over the summer. The September gains brought the total employment change in this industry to a level similar to that of February. While employment in manufacturing remained well below pre-pandemic levels in Alberta (-17,000; -12.1%) and to a lesser extent in Quebec (-15,000; -3.1%), employment was above the pre-COVID level in Ontario (+17,000; +2.3%). The most recent gross domestic product by industry data showed a significant expansion in the manufacturing sector for the months of June (+5.9%) and July (+15.9%), as many factories ramped up production in response to the initial re-opening of the economy. Despite the continued gains through July, manufacturing activity remained about 6% below February's pre-pandemic level. Results from the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing showed that sales increased for a third consecutive month in July, with motor vehicle and parts producers accounting for most of the increase, as many automakers shortened or skipped their summer shutdowns. Early in the COVID-19 economic shutdown, concerns about availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) stemmed largely from concerns about access to international supplies. As of July, 7.4% of businesses in the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail trade sectors are involved with the production or distribution of PPE, according to the report titled ""Gearing up to restart: Businesses' need for personal protective equipment,"" released today. Employment in educational services rises in September and surpasses pre-COVID levels Employment in educational services grew by 68,000 (+5.0%) in September, led by Ontario and Quebec. After declining by 11.5% from February to April, employment in the industry has now increased for five consecutive months and has reached a level 2.6% higher than in February. As students returned to school in August and September, a number of jurisdictions increased staffing levels to support classroom adaptations. On a year-over-year basis, employment in educational services was up by 32,000 (+2.3%) in September, driven by an increase in elementary and secondary school teachers and educational counsellors (not seasonally adjusted). Employment slow to recover for low-wage employees The labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown has been particularly severe for low-wage employees (defined as those who earned less than $16.03 per hour, or two-thirds of the 2019 annual median wage of $24.04/hour). From February to April, employment among low-wage employees fell by 38.1%, compared with a decline of 12.7% for all other paid employees (not seasonally adjusted). In September, there were one-fifth fewer (-22.1%; -761,000) low-wage employees than 12 months previously. In comparison, there was a small year-over-year increase (+295,000; +2.3%) in all other employees, reflecting the uneven labour market impact of COVID-19 on different groups of workers. Almost half (48.8%) of the year-over-year decline in low-wage employees in September was accounted for by three industries: retail trade; accommodation and food services; and business, building and other support services industries. The ability of former employees to return to employment—either in their previous industry or in new activities—will be critical to both the economic well-being of workers and the performance and productivity of the economy. Strong employment growth among core-age women, while youth employment continues to lag behind in recovery Employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) increased for the fifth consecutive month in September (+134,000; +2.3%), with gains split between full-time and part-time work. Employment for this group was within 2.1% of its pre-COVID February level—the closest of the major demographic groups. On a year-over-year basis, employment among core-aged women declined most in the accommodation and food services; and the business, building and other support services industries. These declines were partially offset by gains in the insurance, real estate, rental and leasing industry; as well as in educational services. Following a drop of 0.5 percentage points, the unemployment rate for core aged women was 7.0% in September, the lowest rate among the major demographic groups. The unemployment decline coincided with more women in the labour market, driven by five consecutive months of strong job growth. The participation rate for women in the core working age of 25 to 54 fully returned to its pre-COVID rate of 83.5% (compared with a record-low of 77.8% in April). Chart 5 Core-aged men and women closer to pre-shutdown employment levels Employment returns to pre-COVID levels for both mothers and fathers From August to September, employment increased at a much faster pace for core-aged mothers with children aged 18 years and younger (+6.4%; +171,000) than for fathers with children of the same age (+1.7%; +47,000). The monthly increase was driven by a typical seasonal increase in women working in the educational services industry as the new school year began (not seasonally adjusted). Total employment in September was on par with pre-pandemic levels for both mothers (+0.9%) and fathers (+1.5%), regardless of whether the youngest child was pre-school or school-aged (not seasonally adjusted). Despite this employment recovery, it is taking longer for work absences to return to pre-COVID levels among mothers. In September, the number of mothers who worked less than half of their usual hours for reasons most likely related to COVID-19 was 70.0% higher than in February, compared with 23.7% among fathers (not seasonally adjusted). This includes lost hours due to personal circumstances, such as caring for children, as well as those related to job situation, such as reduced shifts. Among parents who were at work in the September reference week, mothers (33.3%) were more likely than fathers (26.8%) to have worked most of their hours from home. This may indicate that more mothers than fathers were trying to balance work and childcare responsibilities. Core-aged men disproportionately affected by slow growth in construction as well as transportation and warehousing Employment among core-age men rose by 61,000 (+1.0%) in September, driven by full-time gains. This brought core-aged men to within 2.4% of their pre-COVID employment level. On a year-over-year basis, two industries—construction, and transportation and warehousing—accounted for the majority of all employment declines among core-aged men. The unemployment rate for men aged 25 to 54 dropped 0.5 percentage points to 7.6% in September but remained well above the near-record-low of 4.3% observed 12 months earlier. Like their female counterparts, labour force participation among men in the core working-age group fully returned to its pre-COVID rate in September (up 0.3 percentage points to 91.2%). This was up markedly from the record-low participation rate of 85.3% in April. Chart 6 The gender gap in employment recovery among parents closes in September Youth employment remains furthest from pre-COVID levels Employment increased among youth aged 15 to 24 in September, including gains for young women (+62,000; +5.7%) and young men (+66,000; +6.0%). Despite these monthly increases, employment remained further from full recovery for youth than for other major age groups, with female youth employment being 10.4% below February levels and male youth being 10.2% below. On a year-over-year basis, youth employment in accommodation and food services was down 99,000 (-20.0%, not seasonally adjusted) in September. This industry typically accounts for one-fifth of youth employment (19.6% in 2019). Youth unemployment rate declines as students return to school The unemployment rate for male youth aged 15 to 24 fell to 20.5% in September. This was a drop of 5.1 percentage points from August to September. Similarly, the unemployment rate for female youth declined 3.0 percentage points to 17.2% in September. Youth unemployment rates were considerably higher than a year earlier—up 6.6 percentage points for young men, and 7.5 percentage points for young women. Chart 7 Youth unemployment rates remain high in September Schools reopened for most students by mid-September, albeit with many changes involving online and in-person classes. Almost two-thirds (62.8%) of young Canadians aged 15 to 24 were enrolled in school in September, a level similar to September 2019 (62.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate of youth who belong to a population group designated as a visible minority fell by 7.6 percentage points in September (not seasonally adjusted), a larger decline than among youth who were not a visible minority or Indigenous (down 2.6 percentage points). Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained higher among visible minority youth (24.7%) than among youth who were not a visible minority or Indigenous (15.4%) (not seasonally adjusted). More people aged 55 and older working in September Employment among workers aged 55 and older rose by 57,000 (+1.4%) in September. Following five consecutive monthly employment gains, employment for this group was within 4.1% of its pre-pandemic February level. Employment among older men (3.2% below pre-pandemic levels) has recovered at a faster pace than for older women (5.4% below pre-pandemic levels). By industry, year-over-year employment declines for people in this age group were largest in the construction and the health care and social assistance industries. Compared with 12 months earlier, the participation rate for people aged 55 and older had virtually recovered for men (43.5%) in September, while it remained 1.7 percentage points below for women (31.1%). Employment rate among very recent immigrants remains closest to February level, as restrictions placed on international borders continue to impact international migration The employment rate of immigrants who landed in Canada more than five years ago increased by 1.7 percentage points to 57.8% in September. By comparison, the employment rate for people born in Canada increased by 0.5 percentage points to 60.0%. Immigrants who landed in Canada more than five years ago are more likely than very recent immigrants to be employed in industries where employment has been relatively less affected by COVID-19, including health care and social assistance; public administration; and finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing. For more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant employment, see Transitions into and out of employment by immigrants during the COVID-19 lockdown and recovery. The employment rate among very recent immigrants (five years or less) was little changed in September, at 63.6%. Trends in labour market indicators for this group should be understood in the context of a declining population resulting from restrictions placed on international migration. For more information on recent changes in international migration, see Canada's population estimates: Age and sex, July 1, 2020. Employment increases for Indigenous people Employment among Indigenous people living off-reserve increased by 2.7% (+15,000) from August to September, while employment among non-Indigenous Canadians rose by 1.5% (+264,000) (not seasonally adjusted). In September, employment for Indigenous people was at 93.9% of its February level, compared with 98.1% for non-Indigenous Canadians. Recovery to pre-COVID employment levels continues to be uneven across regions Employment increased in every province except New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in September, with the largest gains in Ontario and Quebec. For further information on key province-level and industry-level labour market indicators, see Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app. As of September, employment was relatively close to pre-COVID February levels in a number of provinces, including Manitoba (-1.8%) and New Brunswick (-3.0%). Among the four provinces with the largest populations, employment was closest to February levels in Quebec (-2.6%) and farthest in Alberta (-5.4%). In British Columbia, there were 3.7% fewer people working in September than in February, while in Ontario there were 4.2% fewer people working. Employment in Ontario increased by 168,000 in September (+2.4%), largely in full-time work, and building on gains of 670,000 over the previous three months. The largest employment gains in September were in accommodation and food services, manufacturing, and educational services. The unemployment rate fell 1.1 percentage points to 9.5%, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. During the LFS reference week of September 13 to September 19, all regions of Ontario were in Stage 3 reopening. However, public health measures such as physical distancing requirements and limits on gatherings remained in place and were tightened for the hot spots of Toronto, Peel and Ottawa on September 17 and for the rest of the province on September 19. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, employment increased by 114,000 (+3.4%), a faster pace of growth than the province overall. Employment in Toronto grew to within 3.5% of its pre-pandemic level. In Quebec, employment rose by 77,000 (+1.8%), adding to gains of 630,000 over the previous four months. Educational services and accommodation and food services contributed the most to the gains in September. The unemployment rate fell 1.3 percentage points to 7.4%, the fifth consecutive monthly decline, but still well above the low attained just prior to the start of the pandemic. Prior to the downturn, the unemployment rate in Quebec had trended downward for four years in a row, reaching a record-low of 5.1% on average in 2019. In the Montréal CMA, employment grew by 57,000 (+2.7%) in September, a faster growth rate than the province. Employment in Montréal was 1.4% below its pre-pandemic level. All provinces in Western Canada had more people working in September, led by British Columbia and Alberta. In British Columbia, employment grew by 55,000 (+2.3%) in September, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. The unemployment rate fell 2.3 percentage points to 8.4%. In the Vancouver CMA, employment increased by 35,000 (+2.7%) in the month and was 7.9% below its February level, a degree of recovery lower than the province as a whole. In Alberta, employment rose by 38,000 (+1.8%) in September, nearly all in full-time work. Educational services, information, culture and recreation, and public administration contributed the most to the increase. The unemployment rate was little changed at 11.7% as more people participated in the labour market. Alberta had the slowest employment growth rate of all provinces in 2019 at 0.5%, compared with the national growth rate of 2.1%. In Manitoba, employment increased for the fifth consecutive month, up 15,000 in September, while the unemployment rate fell 1.1 percentage points to 7.0%. In Atlantic Canada, Nova Scotia reported the largest employment gain in September, up 12,000 (+2.7%), continuing the upward trend that began five months earlier. Employment in Nova Scotia was within 3.2% of its February level and the unemployment rate fell 2.4 percentage points to 7.9%. After notable increases in May and June, employment in New Brunswick has changed little in recent months and held steady in September. The unemployment rate rose 1.0 percentage points in September to 10.4% as more people searched for work. In Prince Edward Island, employment fell slightly (-800) following four successive monthly gains. The unemployment rate in September was 10.1%. Chart 8 Employment increases in most provinces in September but remains below February levels Quarterly update for the territories The Labour Force Survey collects labour market data in the territories, produced in the form of three-month moving averages. In the third quarter ending in September, employment in Yukon held steady, following a decline of 1,200 in the second quarter. The unemployment rate remained at 6.2%. Over the same period, employment as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older was little changed at 65.0%. Following a decline of 1,300 in the second quarter, employment in the Northwest Territories was little changed in the third quarter. The unemployment rate was 9.4%. Employment in Nunavut increased by an estimated 1,100 people in the third quarter, partly offsetting the decline in the previous quarter. Employment as a percentage of the population rose from 44.8% in the second quarter to 48.7% in the third quarter. The unemployment rate was little changed at 16.0%. September unemployment rates similar in Canada and the United States The COVID-19 global pandemic has profoundly impacted the economies and labour markets of countries around the world. While comparisons of these impacts are challenging due to differences in concepts, survey design and reference periods, comparisons between the labour market situations of Canada and the United States can be made by carefully adjusting Canadian data to US concepts. For more information on Canada-US comparisons, see ""Measuring Employment and Unemployment in Canada and the United States – A comparison."" Adjusted to US concepts, the unemployment rate in Canada was 7.9% in September, the same as the rate reported in the United States. The Canadian rate was 3.3 percentage points higher than in February, while the American rate was 4.4 percentage points higher. At the same time, the employment rate (the number of employed as a percentage of the working age population) was 59.7% in Canada and 56.6% in the United States in September. The Canadian employment rate was 2.7 percentage points lower in September than in February, compared with 4.5 percentage points lower in the United States. The labour force participation rate in Canada was 64.8% in September, 0.6 percentage points lower than it was in February. In the United States, the participation rate was 61.4%, 2.0 percentage points lower than in February. Looking ahead: Upcoming changes to economic support benefits CERB recipients more likely to be in households with financial difficulties In March and April, the federal government introduced a number of programs, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) to help Canadians adjust to the impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown. From August to September, the proportion of Canadians receiving CERB, CESB, or regular Employment Insurance (EI) payments fell from 16.1% to 13.5%. The relatively slow recovery of self-employment—and the number of hours worked by self-employed Canadians—is reflected in the profile of those receiving COVID-19 support payments. In September, one in five (21.8%) CERB recipients were either currently self-employed or had been self-employed in the last 12 months. The proportion of CERB recipients living in a household experiencing difficulty meeting its necessary expenses increased to 42.0%, up 4.3 percentage points from August. On September 27, some CERB recipients transitioned to the EI program. The federal government has announced that it intends to introduce new support programs for CERB recipients who are not eligible for EI, including the Canada Recovery Benefit for self-employed workers. As part of Statistics Canada's commitment to understanding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the labour market, the LFS will continue to monitor the extent to which Canadians take advantage of these COVID-19 economic support programs.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for September are for the week of September 13 to 19. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey"". This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. Since March 2020, LFS collection operations have been adapted to ensure that high quality information is collected in a way which protects the health and safety of both Statistics Canada interviewers and respondents. All face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone or online interviews. In addition, all telephone interviews have been conducted by interviewers working from their home rather than Statistics Canada's call centres. As was the case in June, July and August, approximately 40,000 interviews were completed in September. To provide advice and guidance on future adaptations to LFS collection strategies, and the quality of LFS information, Statistics Canada has created a Labour Force Survey Expert Panel. Membership of this panel will be announced in the coming weeks. The distribution of LFS interviews in September 2020 compared with August 2020, was as follows: Personal face-to-face interviews • August 2020 0.0% • September 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from call centres • August 2020 0.0% • September 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • August 2020 69.2% • September 2020 67.4% Online interviews • August 2020 30.8% • September 2020 32.6% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in September 2020 analysis To continue capturing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the supplementary indicators used in March and April have been slightly adapted. Therefore, the May to September supplementary indicators are not directly comparable to the supplementary indicators published in April and March 2020. Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Time-related underemployment rate combines people who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours as a proportion of all employed people. New information on population groups Beginning in July, the LFS includes a question asking respondents to report the population groups to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2016 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Other For LFS records interviewed before July, population group characteristics were assigned using an experimental sample matching data integration method. This involved directly integrating LFS and census information for approximately 20% of LFS records. For the remaining 80%, population group characteristics were assigned using information available at the population level from both LFS and census. Further development of this method will continue in the coming months. According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, data for the population who identify as Aboriginals are analyzed separately. The remaining category is described as ""people not designated as visible minorities"" or ""people who are not a visible minority."" Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Next release The next release of the LFS will be on November 6.

A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 of which 50,000 or more must live in the core. A CA must have a core population of at least 10,000. To be included in the CMA or CA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from previous census place of work data. If the population of the core of a CA declines below 10,000, the CA is retired. However, once an area becomes a CMA, it is retained as a CMA even if its total population declines below 100,000 or the population of its core falls below 50,000. Small population centres with a population count of less than 10,000 are called fringe. All areas inside the CMA or CA that are not population centres are rural areas. When a CA has a core of at least 50,000, it is subdivided into census tracts. Census tracts are maintained for the CA even if the population of the core subsequently falls below 50,000. All CMAs are subdivided into census tracts. Census years 2011, 2006, 2001, 1996, 1991, 1986, 1981, 1976, 1971, 1966, 1961, 1956, 1951, 1941 Remarks The terms 'core,' 'fringe' and 'rural area' replace the terms 'urban core,' 'urban fringe' and 'rural fringe' for the 2011 Census. Cores A census metropolitan area (CMA) or a census agglomeration (CA) can have more than one core. The core of a CMA must have a population of at least 50,000 and the core of a CA must have a population of at least 10,000. In all other cases where a CMA or a CA has more than one core, the additional cores are called secondary cores. When a CA is merged with a CMA, the core of the former CA also becomes a secondary core of the CMA. If the population of a fringe population centre exceeds 10,000, it becomes a secondary core of the CMA or CA in which it exists. See Merging adjacent CMAs and CAs (delineation rule 7). Delineation rules for CMAs and CAs A CMA or CA is delineated using adjacent municipalities (census subdivisions) as building blocks. These census subdivisions (CSDs) are included in the CMA or CA if they meet at least one of the following rules. The rules are ranked in order of priority. A CSD obeying the rules for two or more CMAs or CAs is included in the one for which it has the highest ranked rule. If the CSD meets rules that have the same rank, the decision is based on the population or the number of commuters involved. A CMA or CA is delineated to ensure spatial contiguity. 1. Core rule: The CSD falls completely or partly inside the core. A core hole is a CSD enclosed by a CSD that is at least partly within the core and must be included to maintain spatial contiguity. In Figure 6, CSDs A, B and C are included in the CMA or CA because of the core rule. CSD C is a core hole. Figure 6 Core rule Description for Figure 6 Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population. 2. Forward commuting flow rule: Given a minimum of 100 commuters, at least 50% of the employed labour force living in the CSD works in the delineation core (see following note), as determined from commuting data based on the place of work question in the previous census. Note: For CMA and CA delineation purposes, a delineation core is created respecting CSD limits. For a CSD to be included in the primary or the secondary delineation core, at least 75% of a CSD's population must reside within the core. In Figure 7, CSD A is part of the delineation core since its entire population resides within the core. CSD B would also be part of the delineation core if at least 75% of its population resides within the core. For this example, we have assumed that less than 75% of the population of CSD B resides within the core; therefore, CSD B and its enclosed hole, CSD C, are not considered to be part of the delineation core. Figure 7 Forward commuting flow rule Description for Figure 7 Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population. 3. Reverse commuting flow rule: Given a minimum of 100 commuters, at least 25% of the employed labour force working in the CSD lives in the delineation core as determined from commuting data based on the place of work question in the previous census. In Figure 8, at least 25% of the employed labour force working in CSD E lives in CSD A (see Note for rule 2). Figure 8 Reverse commuting flow rule Description for Figure 8 Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population. 4. Spatial contiguity rule: CSDs that do not meet a commuting flow threshold may be included in a CMA or CA, and CSDs that do meet a commuting flow threshold may be excluded from a CMA or CA. Two situations can lead to inclusion or exclusion of a CSD in a CMA or CA for reasons of spatial contiguity. Specifically these are: Outlier — A CSD (F in Figure 9) with sufficient commuting flows (either forward or reverse) is enclosed by a CSD (G in Figure 9) with insufficient commuting flows, but which is adjacent to the CMA or CA. When this situation arises, the CSDs within and including the enclosing CSD are grouped to create a minimum CSD set (F + G). The total commuting flows for the minimum CSD set are then considered for inclusion in the CMA or CA. If the minimum CSD set has sufficient commuting flows (either forward or reverse), then all of its CSDs are included in the CMA or CA. Hole — A CSD (H in Figure 9) with insufficient commuting flows (either forward or reverse) is enclosed by a CSD (I in Figure 9) with sufficient commuting flows, and which is adjacent to the CMA or CA. When this situation arises, the CSDs within and including the enclosing CSD are grouped to create a minimum CSD set (H + I). The total commuting flows for the minimum CSD set are then considered for inclusion in the CMA or CA. If the minimum CSD set has sufficient commuting flows (either forward or reverse), then all of its CSDs are included in the CMA or CA. Figure 9 Spatial contiguity rule Description for Figure 9 Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population. 5. Historical comparability rule: To maintain historical comparability for CMAs and larger CAs (those with census tracts in the previous census), CSDs are retained in the CMA or CA even if their commuting flow percentages fall below the commuting flow thresholds (rules 2 and 3). See Figure 10. Figure 10 Historical comparability rule Description for Figure 10 Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population. An exception to the historical comparability rule is made in cases where CSDs have undergone changes to their boundaries, such as annexations. To determine whether to keep or exclude a CSD, place of work data are retabulated for the CSD with boundary changes, and a decision to include or exclude the CSD is made according to the previous rules. 6. Manual adjustments: A CMA or CA represents an area that is economically and socially integrated. However, there are certain limitations to the extent by which this ideal can be met. Since the CSDs that are used as building blocks in CMA and CA delineation are administrative units, their boundaries are not always the most suitable with respect to CMA and CA delineation. There are always situations where the application of the above rules creates undesirable outcomes, or where the rules cannot be easily applied. In these circumstances, a manual override is sometimes applied to ensure that the integrity of the program is retained. For example, in Miramichi CA (New Brunswick), the CSD of Red Bank 4, IRI, which is in two parts, is included to maintain spatial contiguity. 7. Merging adjacentCMAs and CAs: A CA adjacent to a CMA can be merged with the CMA if the total percentage commuting interchange between the CA and CMA is equal to at least 35% of the employed labour force living in the CA, based on place of work data from the previous census. The total percentage commuting interchange is the sum of the commuting flow in both directions between the CMA and the CA as a percentage of the labour force living in the CA (i.e., resident employed labour force). Description for Formula 1 If more than one CA is adjacent to the same CMA, each CA is assessed separately with the CMA. Several CAs may be merged with one CMA. If the total percentage commuting interchange is less than 35%, the CMA and CA are not merged. After a CA is merged with a CMA, the core of the former CA is called the secondary core of the CMA. See Figure 11. Figure 11 Example of a merged census metropolitan area and census agglomeration Description for Figure 11 Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population. Naming convention for CMAs and CAs Prior to May 25, 2009, the convention for the naming of a CMA or CA was based on the name of the principal population centre or largest city at the time the CMA or CA was first formed. This standard had been used since the 1971 Census. Through the years, the CMA and CA names have remained stable. The most important changes resulted from name changes to the census subdivisions (resulting from municipal dissolutions, incorporations and name changes). Guidelines for CMA name change requests The key revision to the convention is the establishment of 'Guidelines for CMA name change requests' as published in Preliminary 2011 Census Metropolitan and Census Agglomeration Delineation(Catalogue no. 92F0138M). Below are the guidelines for requesting a change: CMA names can consist of up to three legislated municipal names of eligible census subdivisions (CSDs) that are components of the CMA. However, the number of name elements in any new CMA name request is limited to five. If any of the eligible CSD names are already hyphenated or compound, the number of CSD names will be limited to two or one if the number of name elements exceeds five. The eligible municipal names include the historic central municipality name and the two component CSDs with the largest population, and having a population of at least 10,000, according to the last census. The ordering of the municipal names within the CMA name is determined by the historic (central) municipality and the population size of the eligible CSDs. The first component of the CMA name is always the historic (central) CSD even if its census population count is less than the other eligible component CSDs. This ensures that CMA names retain a measure of stability for better longitudinal recognition. The second and third place name order is determined by population size. The component CSD with the higher census population count at the time of the name change assumes the second position and the next largest component CSD, the third position. In order for a requested CMA name change to be implemented, there must be explicit consensus among all eligible component municipalities on a proposed new name and a formal request, in accordance with these guidelines, must be sent to the Director of the Geography Division at Statistics Canada by June 1 of the year prior to the census. The CMA name change will be implemented in the revision of the Standard Geographical Classification related to the census under consideration. Statistics Canada will continue to change CMA names whenever the legislated name of a municipality changes. Any other request for a name change will only be considered within the context of these guidelines. CMA/CA coding structure Each CMA and CA is assigned a three-digit code that identifies it uniquely in Canada. The first digit is the same as the second digit of the province code in which the CMA or CA is located. If a CMA or CA spans a provincial boundary, then the province code assigned represents the province with the greater proportion of core population. Codes for CAs in Yukon and the Northwest Territories begin with the same digit as for those CMAs or CAs located in British Columbia. There are currently no CMAs or CAs in Nunavut. Table 1 - Examples of CMA /CA codes CMA /CA code CMA /CA name 001 St. John's CMA (N.L.) 215 Truro CA (N.S.) 462 Montréal CMA (Que.) 995 Yellowknife CA (N.W.T.) If data for provincial parts are required, it is recommended that the two-digit province/territory (PR) code precede the CMA/CA code for those CMAs/CAs that cross provincial boundaries. For example: Table 2 - Examples of CMA /CA codes with provincial parts PR- CMA /CA code CMA /CA name 24 505 Ottawa - Gatineau CMA (Quebec part) 35 505 Ottawa - Gatineau CMA (Ontario part) 47 840 Lloydminster CA (Saskatchewan part) 48 840 Lloydminster CA (Alberta part) Table 1 in the Introduction shows the number of census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations by province and territory. Changes to the number of CMAs and CAs for the 2011 Census Two CMAs from the previous census had their names changed: Abbotsford became Abbotsford-Mission (B.C.) and Kitchener became Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo (Ont.). Five new CAs were created: Steinbach (Man.), High River (Alta.), Strathmore (Alta.), Sylvan Lake (Alta.) and Lacombe (Alta.). The CAs of La Tuque (Que.) and Kitimat (B.C.) were retired because the population of their cores dropped below 10,000 in 2006. Data quality CMAs and CAs are statistically comparable because they are delineated in the same way across Canada. They differ from other areas such as trading or marketing areas, or regional planning areas designated by regional authorities for planning and other purposes, and should be used with caution for non-statistical purposes. The CSD limits used in CMA and CA delineation are those in effect on January 1, 2011 (the geographic reference date for the 2011 Census) and received by Statistics Canada before March 1, 2011. In addition, CMA and CA delineation uses commuting data based on the place of work question asked in the previous census. Refer to the related definitions of census subdivision (CSD); core, fringe and rural area; population centre (POPCTR) and to the geography working paper Preliminary 2011 Census Metropolitan Area and Census Agglomeration Delineation(Catalogue no. 92F0138MWE2009002). Changes prior to the current census 2006 For 2006, CAs were no longer required to have an urban core population of 100,000 to be promoted to the status of a CMA. Instead, CAs assumed the status of a CMA if they had attained a total population of at least 100,000 of which 50,000 or more lived in the urban core. Prior to the 2011 Census, CMA and CA delineation used commuting data based on the place of work question asked in the decennial census. The 2006 CMAs and CAs are based on the population and place of work data from the 2001 Census while the 2001 and 1996 CMAs and CAs are based on population and place of work data from the 1991 Census. 2001 For 2001, CAs were required to have an urban core population of at least 100,000 to be changed to the status of a CMA. For 2001, consolidated CMAs were no longer defined for dissemination purposes. As a result, primary CMAs and primary CAs were also not defined. However, the consolidation rule was retained and incorporated into the CMA delineation methodology. There was no substantive change to the methodology for defining CMAs and no change to the limits of CMAs resulting from this rule change. Prior to 2001, adjacent CMAs and CAs that had sufficient commuting interchange (35% or more) and were merged were identified by the terms 'primary census metropolitan area (PCMA)' and 'primary census agglomeration (PCA).' The terms 'consolidated census metropolitan area (CCMA)' and 'consolidated census agglomeration (CCA)' described the sum of the component CMAs and CAs. Census data were disseminated for these areas. These terms were not used for the standard dissemination program for 2001. Six of 27 CMAs were affected significantly as a result of municipal restructuring: Halifax (N.S.), Ottawa – Hull (Ont./Que.), Kingston (Ont.), Greater Sudbury (Ont.), London (Ont.) and Windsor (Ont.). 1996 Two changes to CMA/CA delineation rules were implemented to preserve data comparability over time. CMAs could be consolidated with CAs, but they could not be consolidated with other CMAs. A primary census agglomeration (PCA) could not be retired from a consolidated CMA or CA (with census tracts at the previous census) even if its total commuting interchange percentage dropped below the consolidation threshold of 35%. Exceptions to this rule could occur due to changes in the physical structure of the urban areas used to determine the urban cores. Minimum sets of CSDs were used instead of the census consolidated subdivisions (CCSs) for evaluation in the spatial contiguity rule. Refer to the spatial contiguity rule (rule 4). 1986 Introduction of the consolidated and primary CMA and CA concept. The forward commuting threshold was raised from 40% to 50% to control for differences in processing of the place of work data between 1971 and 1981. Introduction of the minimum of 100 commuters for forward and reverse commuting for both CMAs and CAs. Single CSD (component) CAs were permitted. 1981 Commuting data based on the place of work question of the previous decennial census were used for the first time to delineate CAs. For both CMAs and CAs, the forward commuting threshold was 40% and the reverse commuting threshold was 25%. The minimum urbanized core population for CAs was raised from 2,000 to 10,000. CAs were eligible for census tracts if they had a CSD with a population of at least 50,000 at the time of the previous census. Single CSD (component) CAs could be created for subdivision into census tracts. 1976 Commuting data based on the place of work question of the previous decennial census were used for the first time to delineate CMAs. The forward commuting threshold was 40% and the reverse commuting threshold was 25% for the CMAs. For CAs, see 1971. 1971 CMAs were defined as main labour market areas, but were delineated according to alternate criteria based on the labour force composition, population growth rate and accessibility. At this time, the CMA of Saint John, N.B. was 'grandfathered.' CAs were comprised of at least two adjacent municipal entities. These entities had to be at least partly urban and belong to an urbanized core having a population of at least 2,000. The urbanized core included a largest city and a remainder, each with a population of at least 1,000, and had a population density of at least 1,000 per square mile (386 people per square kilometre). 1966 See 1961. 1961 CMAs were delineated around cities with a population of at least 50,000, if the population density and labour force composition criteria were met, and the total CMA population was at least 100,000. CAs were called major urban areas; see 1951. 1956 See 1951. 1951 The term 'census metropolitan area' appeared for the first time. This term designated cities of over 50,000 having fringe municipalities in close geographic, economic and social relations, the whole constituting a unit of over 100,000. The concept of 'major urban areas,' the forerunners to CAs, was introduced. The term designated urban areas in which the largest city had a population of at least 25,000 and fewer than 50,000. 1941 Data were published for 'greater cities,' i.e., those cities which have well-defined satellite communities in close economic relationship to them.

A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. Footnote 2 The statistical unit of measures used is the business establishment, which represents a unit of production, such as a factory, store, or head office. By comparison, an enterprise may have many establishments that might operate in different regions and industries.The business counts used for this table are based on establishments within firms to which payroll/employment can be associated in the Survey of Employment Payrol and Hours (SEPH). Establishment refers to the level in the statistical hierarchy of the Business Register at which the accounting data required to measure production are available (principal inputs, revenues, salaries and wages). The establishment is defined as the most homogeneous unit of production for which the business maintains accounting records. From these records, it is possible to assemble all the data elements required to compile the gross value of production (total sales or shipments, and inventories), the cost of materials and services, and labour and capital used in production. For more details, please see: https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Var.pl?Function=Unit&Id=23893 Footnote 3 Active businesses are those businesses that reported having one or more employees in a given month. Footnote 4 Opening businesses are businesses that transition from having no employees in the previous month to having at least one employee in the current month. These instances occur when a new, small firm begins, when a large firm opens a new establishment or when a seasonal firm re-opens. Footnote 5 Continuing businesses are businesses that have at least one employee in the previous month and at least one employee in the current month. Footnote 6 Closing businesses are businesses that transition from having at least one employee in the previous month to having no employees in the current month. These instances occur when a small firm goes out of business, when a large firm closes an establishement temporarily or permanently, and when a seasonal firm ceases business activity for the year.

Context: COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease The September Labour Force Survey (LFS) results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of September 13 to 19. At the beginning of September, as Canadian families adapted to new back-to-school routines, public health restrictions had been substantially eased across the country and many businesses and workplaces had re-opened. Throughout the month, some restrictions were re-imposed in response to increases in the number of COVID-19 cases. In British Columbia, new rules and guidelines related to bars and restaurants were implemented on September 8. In Ontario, limits on social gatherings were tightened for the hot spots of Toronto, Peel and Ottawa on September 17 and for the rest of the province on September 19. Assessing the labour market as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions continues This LFS release continues to integrate the international standard concepts such as employment and unemployment with supplementary indicators that help to monitor the labour market as restrictions are lifted and capture the full scope of the impacts of COVID-19. A series of survey enhancements were continued in September, including supplementary questions on working from home, workplace adaptations, financial capacity, concerns related to returning to usual workplaces and receipt of federal COVID-19 support payments. This release also includes, for the third consecutive month, information on the labour market conditions of population groups designated as visible minorities. Through the addition of a new survey question and the introduction of new statistical methods, the LFS is now able to more fully determine the impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown on diverse groups of Canadians. Data from the LFS are based on a sample of more than 50,000 households. Statistics Canada continued to protect the health and safety of Canadians in September by adjusting the processes involved in survey operations. We are deeply grateful to the many Canadians who responded to the survey. Their ongoing cooperation ensures that we continue to paint an accurate and current portrait of the Canadian labour market and Canada's economic performance. Highlights Employment rose by 378,000 (+2.1%) in September, bringing employment to within 720,000 (-3.7%) of its pre-COVID February level Most of the employment increase in September was in full-time work, which rose by 334,000 (+2.1%), building on gains of 206,000 (+1.4%) in August. The number of Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 fell by 108,000 (-7.1%) in September. Among Canadians who worked most of their usual hours, the proportion working from home edged down from August to September, from 26.4% to 25.6%. Employment increased in every province except New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in September, with the largest gains in Ontario and Quebec. Self-employment was little changed in September. Compared with February, self-employment was down 6.0%, while the number of employees was within 3.3% of its pre-pandemic level. Employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) increased for the fifth consecutive month (+134,000; +2.3%) in September, outpacing core-age men. The increase was split between full-time and part-time work. Employment for this group was within 2.1% of pre-COVID employment levels—the closest of the major demographic groups. Employment among core-age men rose by 61,000 (+1.0%) in September, driven by full-time gains. This brought core aged men to within 2.4% of their pre-COVID employment level. For both mothers (+0.9%) and fathers (+1.5%), September employment was on par with pre-pandemic levels (not seasonally adjusted). Employment growth was strong for young women (+62,000 or +5.7%) and men (+66,000 or +6.0%) aged 15 to 24 in September. Despite these increases, employment for Canadian youth remained 10% below February levels, much further behind the recovery in the other major demographic groups. Compared with September 2019, the number of low-wage employees was down by more than one-fifth (-761,000) in September 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate declined for the fourth consecutive month in September, falling 1.2 percentage points to 9.0% There were 1.8 million unemployed Canadians in September, down 214,000 (-10.5%) from August and continuing the four-month downward trend from the record-high 2.6 million unemployed people in May. The majority of unemployed people (approximately 1.5 million) were looking for work. The number of people who wanted to work but did not search for a job (580,000) has been trending downward since peaking at 1.5 million in April. The unemployment rate of Black Canadians dropped 5.9 percentage points to 11.7% in September, while the rate for Filipino Canadians declined by 4.2 percentage points to 8.5%. The unemployment rate for male youth aged 15 to 24 remained the highest among all major demographic groups at 20.5% in September, although it was down 5.1 percentage points from August. Employment continued to increase in both the services-producing (+2.1%) and the goods-producing (+2.0%) sectors in September In services, monthly gains were led by accommodation and food services (+72,000), educational services (+68,000) as well as information, culture and recreation (+56,000). In the goods sector, employment gains were largest in manufacturing (+68,000). Employment was 3.6% below its pre-COVID February level in the services sector, and 4.3% below in the goods-producing sector. Compared with February, total employment was down 720,000 (-3.7%), with three-quarters of this decline coming from four industries: accommodation and food services, retail trade, construction, and transportation and warehousing. While some industries face a long recovery to pre-COVID employment levels, some sectors, including manufacturing, have almost fully recovered. Employment in September is higher than it was in February in educational services. The proportion of Canadians receiving Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) or regular Employment Insurance payments fell from 16.1% in August to 13.5% in September One in five (21.8%) CERB recipients in September were either currently self-employed or had been self-employed in the last 12 months. Employment growth accelerates in September Following an increase of 246,000 (+1.4%) in August, employment rose by 378,000 (+2.1%) in September. The unemployment rate declined 1.2 percentage points to 9.0% in September, down from the peak of 13.7% in May. September gains brought employment to within 720,000 (-3.7%) of its pre-COVID February level. The accommodation and food services (-188,000) and retail trade (-146,000) industries remained furthest from full recovery, while youth employment was 263,000 (-10.3%) below February levels. The number of Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 fell by 108,000 (-7.1%) in September. Combined with the declines from May to August, this left COVID-related absences from work at 605,000 (+74.9%) above February levels. During the September 13 to 19 reference week, the total number of Canadian workers affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown stood at 1.3 million. In April, this number peaked at 5.5 million, including a 3.0 million drop in employment and a COVID-related increase of 2.5 million absences from work. Chart 1 Strong employment growth in September The share of Canadians working from home edges down Among Canadians who worked most of their usual hours, the proportion working from home edged down in September, from 26.4% to 25.6%. Consistent with typical seasonal patterns, the number of Canadians working their usual hours increased notably, with increases among both those working from home (+300,000) and those working at locations other than home (+1.4 million). A large number of Canadians continued to adapt to COVID-19 by working remotely in September, with over twice as many people working from home (4.2 million) than those who usually do so (1.9 million). The transition to working from home has involved new challenges in terms of job demands and balancing work and family life. In September, employees who worked at least half their usual hours and who worked from home worked longer hours on average per week (37.6 hours) than their counterparts who worked outside the home (35.6 hours). Employees working from home also worked more unpaid overtime on average (1.6 hours) than employees working outside the home (0.7 hours). Employment growth concentrated in full-time work Most of the employment increase in September was in full-time work, which rose by 334,000 (+2.1%), building on gains of 206,000 (+1.4%) in August. The number of part-time workers grew at a slower pace in September (+44,000; +1.3%), following virtually no change in August. More than one in five part-time workers (22.7%) wanted full-time work but were unable to find it, an increase of 3.4 percentage points from 12 months earlier. Self-employment unchanged in September For self-employed Canadians, the labour market impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown and subsequent re-opening have been different than for employees. From February to April, employment losses were less pronounced for the self-employed (-79,000; -2.7%) than for employees (-2.9 million; -18.0%). As total employment rebounded from April to September, the number of self-employed workers initially remained flat before declining in August. Self-employment was little changed in September. Compared with February, self-employment was down 6.0%, while the number of employees was within 3.3% of its pre-pandemic level. In addition, the self-employed continued to experience a larger drop in hours than employees. On a year-over-year basis, the total number of hours worked by self-employed workers was down 17.4%, compared with 3.9% for employees. Chart 2 No recovery in self-employment Unemployment rate continues to fall The unemployment rate declined for the fourth consecutive month in September, falling 1.2 percentage points to 9.0%. As a result of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the unemployment rate more than doubled from 5.6% in February to a record high 13.7% in May. By way of comparison, during the 2008/2009 recession, the unemployment rate rose from 6.2% in October 2008 to peak at 8.7% in June 2009. It then took approximately nine years to return to its pre-recession rate. Infographic 1 Unemployment rate continues to fall from May's record high There were 1.8 million unemployed Canadians in September, down 214,000 (-10.5%) from August and continuing the four-month downward trend from the record-high 2.6 million unemployed people in May. The majority of unemployed people (approximately 1.5 million) were job searchers, while 363,000 Canadians were either on temporary layoff, and expected to return to a previous job within six months, or had arrangements to begin a new job within four weeks. In any given month, the net change in unemployment is the difference between the number of people becoming unemployed and those leaving unemployment, either because they became employed or left the labour force. In September, more than half of those who left unemployment became employed (57.3%), while over half of those who became unemployed in September (59.4%) had been out of the labour force in August. Unemployment rate falls for Black Canadians but remains higher than average From August to September, the unemployment rate for 15- to 69-year-olds declined among six of the seven largest population groups designated as visible minorities for which reliable estimates could be produced using the current LFS sample size (not seasonally adjusted). There was little change in the unemployment rate of Arab Canadians. Chart 3 Unemployment rate falls for Black Canadians but remains higher than the average The unemployment rate of Black Canadians dropped 5.9 percentage points to 11.7% in September, while the rate for Filipino Canadians declined by 4.2 percentage points to 8.5% (not seasonally adjusted). Canadians who did not identify as Indigenous and who were not a visible minority continued to have the lowest unemployment rate in September (7.0%), while Arab Canadians (16.3%) had the highest unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted). The decrease in the unemployment rate among Black Canadians in September was mainly attributable to employment gains and lower unemployment in sales and service occupations, as well as in occupations in education, law and social, community and government services. Ontario accounted for nearly 80% of net employment gains within the Black population. Labour underutilization continues to fall The number of people who wanted to work but did not search for a job was down in September (-77,000; -11.8%). If people in this group were included as unemployed, the adjusted unemployment rate would be 11.9%. The overall number of people who wanted to work but did not search for a job (580,000) has been trending downward since peaking at 1.5 million in April. Labour underutilization occurs when people who could potentially work are not working, or when people could work more hours than they are currently. The ""labour underutilization rate"" combines those who were unemployed, those who were not in the labour force but who wanted a job and did not look for one, and those who were employed but worked less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to the pandemic. The labour underutilization rate peaked at 36.1% in April and has trended downward ever since. In September, as the economy continued to recover, the labour underutilization rate fell from 20.3% in August to 18.3%, but still remained well above pre-pandemic levels (11.2% in February). Employment increases in both goods-producing and services-producing sectors Employment continued to increase in both the services-producing (+303,000; +2.1%) and the goods-producing (+75,000; +2.0%) sectors in September. In services, monthly gains were led by accommodation and food services (+72,000), educational services (+68,000) as well as information, culture and recreation (+56,000). In the goods sector, employment gains were largest in manufacturing (+68,000). As the Canadian economy continues to recover and adapt to the impacts of COVID-19, some industries face a longer path to recovery than others. Compared with February, total employment in September was down 720,000 (-3.7%), with three-quarters of this decline coming from four industries: accommodation and food services, retail trade, construction, and transportation and warehousing. Chart 4 Employment in accommodation and food services, retail trade and construction furthest from pre-shutdown levels Employment continues to recover in accommodation and food services but stalls in retail trade Employment in accommodation and food services rose by 72,000 (+7.4%) in September. This was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and brought total gains since the initial easing of COVID-19 restrictions in May to 427,000. Nevertheless, employment in this industry was the furthest from recovery in September, down 15.3% (-188,000) from its pre-pandemic February level. The accommodation and food services industry is likely to continue to face a number of challenges over the coming months. While outdoor dining is likely to become impractical during the winter months and as some COVID restrictions are re-introduced, a recent study indicated that Canadians plan to reduce spending at restaurants (see Expected changes in spending habits during the recovery period). Following four months of increases, employment in retail trade held steady in September. Compared with February, employment in this industry was down by 146,000 (-6.4%). After increasing sharply in May and June, following the initial easing of COVID-19 restrictions, retail sales slowed markedly in July. In construction, long road to recovery remains Employment in construction remained little changed for the second consecutive month in September, and was down by 120,000 (-8.1%) compared with its pre-COVID level. Compared with February, employment in construction was down the most in Ontario (-54,000; -9.5%) and British Columbia (-39,000; -16.3%). Construction consists of three subsectors: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. According to the latest results from the Survey of Employment Payrolls and Hours, employment in construction fell from February to July in each of these subsectors, with the largest decline among specialty trade contractors. Results from the release of investment in building construction for July showed that investment in building construction was slightly lower in July than in February. Employment in transportation and warehousing recovers modestly in September The number of people employed in transportation and warehousing rose by 23,000 (+2.5%) in September, the first notable increase since June. Employment in this industry declined by 82,000 (-8.0%) compared with February. The employment decline since February in the transportation and warehousing industry is consistent with a number of indicators showing that transportation has faced particular challenges in recovering from the COVID-19 economic shutdown. For example, results from the monthly civil aviation statistics program show that major Canadian airlines faced an 89.5% drop in passenger demand from July 2019 to July 2020. Similarly, data from the urban public transit statistics program show that the number of public transit passengers fell by 65.5% year over year in July. Manufacturing employment almost fully recovered, but lagging behind in Alberta While some industries face a long recovery to pre-COVID employment levels, some sectors—including manufacturing—have almost fully recovered. The pace of employment growth in manufacturing picked up in September (+68,000; +4.1%), following two months of modest growth over the summer. The September gains brought the total employment change in this industry to a level similar to that of February. While employment in manufacturing remained well below pre-pandemic levels in Alberta (-17,000; -12.1%) and to a lesser extent in Quebec (-15,000; -3.1%), employment was above the pre-COVID level in Ontario (+17,000; +2.3%). The most recent gross domestic product by industry data showed a significant expansion in the manufacturing sector for the months of June (+5.9%) and July (+15.9%), as many factories ramped up production in response to the initial re-opening of the economy. Despite the continued gains through July, manufacturing activity remained about 6% below February's pre-pandemic level. Results from the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing showed that sales increased for a third consecutive month in July, with motor vehicle and parts producers accounting for most of the increase, as many automakers shortened or skipped their summer shutdowns. Early in the COVID-19 economic shutdown, concerns about availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) stemmed largely from concerns about access to international supplies. As of July, 7.4% of businesses in the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail trade sectors are involved with the production or distribution of PPE, according to the report titled ""Gearing up to restart: Businesses' need for personal protective equipment,"" released today. Employment in educational services rises in September and surpasses pre-COVID levels Employment in educational services grew by 68,000 (+5.0%) in September, led by Ontario and Quebec. After declining by 11.5% from February to April, employment in the industry has now increased for five consecutive months and has reached a level 2.6% higher than in February. As students returned to school in August and September, a number of jurisdictions increased staffing levels to support classroom adaptations. On a year-over-year basis, employment in educational services was up by 32,000 (+2.3%) in September, driven by an increase in elementary and secondary school teachers and educational counsellors (not seasonally adjusted). Employment slow to recover for low-wage employees The labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown has been particularly severe for low-wage employees (defined as those who earned less than $16.03 per hour, or two-thirds of the 2019 annual median wage of $24.04/hour). From February to April, employment among low-wage employees fell by 38.1%, compared with a decline of 12.7% for all other paid employees (not seasonally adjusted). In September, there were one-fifth fewer (-22.1%; -761,000) low-wage employees than 12 months previously. In comparison, there was a small year-over-year increase (+295,000; +2.3%) in all other employees, reflecting the uneven labour market impact of COVID-19 on different groups of workers. Almost half (48.8%) of the year-over-year decline in low-wage employees in September was accounted for by three industries: retail trade; accommodation and food services; and business, building and other support services industries. The ability of former employees to return to employment—either in their previous industry or in new activities—will be critical to both the economic well-being of workers and the performance and productivity of the economy. Strong employment growth among core-age women, while youth employment continues to lag behind in recovery Employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) increased for the fifth consecutive month in September (+134,000; +2.3%), with gains split between full-time and part-time work. Employment for this group was within 2.1% of its pre-COVID February level—the closest of the major demographic groups. On a year-over-year basis, employment among core-aged women declined most in the accommodation and food services; and the business, building and other support services industries. These declines were partially offset by gains in the insurance, real estate, rental and leasing industry; as well as in educational services. Following a drop of 0.5 percentage points, the unemployment rate for core aged women was 7.0% in September, the lowest rate among the major demographic groups. The unemployment decline coincided with more women in the labour market, driven by five consecutive months of strong job growth. The participation rate for women in the core working age of 25 to 54 fully returned to its pre-COVID rate of 83.5% (compared with a record-low of 77.8% in April). Chart 5 Core-aged men and women closer to pre-shutdown employment levels Employment returns to pre-COVID levels for both mothers and fathers From August to September, employment increased at a much faster pace for core-aged mothers with children aged 18 years and younger (+6.4%; +171,000) than for fathers with children of the same age (+1.7%; +47,000). The monthly increase was driven by a typical seasonal increase in women working in the educational services industry as the new school year began (not seasonally adjusted). Total employment in September was on par with pre-pandemic levels for both mothers (+0.9%) and fathers (+1.5%), regardless of whether the youngest child was pre-school or school-aged (not seasonally adjusted). Despite this employment recovery, it is taking longer for work absences to return to pre-COVID levels among mothers. In September, the number of mothers who worked less than half of their usual hours for reasons most likely related to COVID-19 was 70.0% higher than in February, compared with 23.7% among fathers (not seasonally adjusted). This includes lost hours due to personal circumstances, such as caring for children, as well as those related to job situation, such as reduced shifts. Among parents who were at work in the September reference week, mothers (33.3%) were more likely than fathers (26.8%) to have worked most of their hours from home. This may indicate that more mothers than fathers were trying to balance work and childcare responsibilities. Core-aged men disproportionately affected by slow growth in construction as well as transportation and warehousing Employment among core-age men rose by 61,000 (+1.0%) in September, driven by full-time gains. This brought core-aged men to within 2.4% of their pre-COVID employment level. On a year-over-year basis, two industries—construction, and transportation and warehousing—accounted for the majority of all employment declines among core-aged men. The unemployment rate for men aged 25 to 54 dropped 0.5 percentage points to 7.6% in September but remained well above the near-record-low of 4.3% observed 12 months earlier. Like their female counterparts, labour force participation among men in the core working-age group fully returned to its pre-COVID rate in September (up 0.3 percentage points to 91.2%). This was up markedly from the record-low participation rate of 85.3% in April. Chart 6 The gender gap in employment recovery among parents closes in September Youth employment remains furthest from pre-COVID levels Employment increased among youth aged 15 to 24 in September, including gains for young women (+62,000; +5.7%) and young men (+66,000; +6.0%). Despite these monthly increases, employment remained further from full recovery for youth than for other major age groups, with female youth employment being 10.4% below February levels and male youth being 10.2% below. On a year-over-year basis, youth employment in accommodation and food services was down 99,000 (-20.0%, not seasonally adjusted) in September. This industry typically accounts for one-fifth of youth employment (19.6% in 2019). Youth unemployment rate declines as students return to school The unemployment rate for male youth aged 15 to 24 fell to 20.5% in September. This was a drop of 5.1 percentage points from August to September. Similarly, the unemployment rate for female youth declined 3.0 percentage points to 17.2% in September. Youth unemployment rates were considerably higher than a year earlier—up 6.6 percentage points for young men, and 7.5 percentage points for young women. Chart 7 Youth unemployment rates remain high in September Schools reopened for most students by mid-September, albeit with many changes involving online and in-person classes. Almost two-thirds (62.8%) of young Canadians aged 15 to 24 were enrolled in school in September, a level similar to September 2019 (62.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate of youth who belong to a population group designated as a visible minority fell by 7.6 percentage points in September (not seasonally adjusted), a larger decline than among youth who were not a visible minority or Indigenous (down 2.6 percentage points). Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained higher among visible minority youth (24.7%) than among youth who were not a visible minority or Indigenous (15.4%) (not seasonally adjusted). More people aged 55 and older working in September Employment among workers aged 55 and older rose by 57,000 (+1.4%) in September. Following five consecutive monthly employment gains, employment for this group was within 4.1% of its pre-pandemic February level. Employment among older men (3.2% below pre-pandemic levels) has recovered at a faster pace than for older women (5.4% below pre-pandemic levels). By industry, year-over-year employment declines for people in this age group were largest in the construction and the health care and social assistance industries. Compared with 12 months earlier, the participation rate for people aged 55 and older had virtually recovered for men (43.5%) in September, while it remained 1.7 percentage points below for women (31.1%). Employment rate among very recent immigrants remains closest to February level, as restrictions placed on international borders continue to impact international migration The employment rate of immigrants who landed in Canada more than five years ago increased by 1.7 percentage points to 57.8% in September. By comparison, the employment rate for people born in Canada increased by 0.5 percentage points to 60.0%. Immigrants who landed in Canada more than five years ago are more likely than very recent immigrants to be employed in industries where employment has been relatively less affected by COVID-19, including health care and social assistance; public administration; and finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing. For more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant employment, see Transitions into and out of employment by immigrants during the COVID-19 lockdown and recovery. The employment rate among very recent immigrants (five years or less) was little changed in September, at 63.6%. Trends in labour market indicators for this group should be understood in the context of a declining population resulting from restrictions placed on international migration. For more information on recent changes in international migration, see Canada's population estimates: Age and sex, July 1, 2020. Employment increases for Indigenous people Employment among Indigenous people living off-reserve increased by 2.7% (+15,000) from August to September, while employment among non-Indigenous Canadians rose by 1.5% (+264,000) (not seasonally adjusted). In September, employment for Indigenous people was at 93.9% of its February level, compared with 98.1% for non-Indigenous Canadians. Recovery to pre-COVID employment levels continues to be uneven across regions Employment increased in every province except New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in September, with the largest gains in Ontario and Quebec. For further information on key province-level and industry-level labour market indicators, see Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app. As of September, employment was relatively close to pre-COVID February levels in a number of provinces, including Manitoba (-1.8%) and New Brunswick (-3.0%). Among the four provinces with the largest populations, employment was closest to February levels in Quebec (-2.6%) and farthest in Alberta (-5.4%). In British Columbia, there were 3.7% fewer people working in September than in February, while in Ontario there were 4.2% fewer people working. Employment in Ontario increased by 168,000 in September (+2.4%), largely in full-time work, and building on gains of 670,000 over the previous three months. The largest employment gains in September were in accommodation and food services, manufacturing, and educational services. The unemployment rate fell 1.1 percentage points to 9.5%, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. During the LFS reference week of September 13 to September 19, all regions of Ontario were in Stage 3 reopening. However, public health measures such as physical distancing requirements and limits on gatherings remained in place and were tightened for the hot spots of Toronto, Peel and Ottawa on September 17 and for the rest of the province on September 19. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, employment increased by 114,000 (+3.4%), a faster pace of growth than the province overall. Employment in Toronto grew to within 3.5% of its pre-pandemic level. In Quebec, employment rose by 77,000 (+1.8%), adding to gains of 630,000 over the previous four months. Educational services and accommodation and food services contributed the most to the gains in September. The unemployment rate fell 1.3 percentage points to 7.4%, the fifth consecutive monthly decline, but still well above the low attained just prior to the start of the pandemic. Prior to the downturn, the unemployment rate in Quebec had trended downward for four years in a row, reaching a record-low of 5.1% on average in 2019. In the Montréal CMA, employment grew by 57,000 (+2.7%) in September, a faster growth rate than the province. Employment in Montréal was 1.4% below its pre-pandemic level. All provinces in Western Canada had more people working in September, led by British Columbia and Alberta. In British Columbia, employment grew by 55,000 (+2.3%) in September, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. The unemployment rate fell 2.3 percentage points to 8.4%. In the Vancouver CMA, employment increased by 35,000 (+2.7%) in the month and was 7.9% below its February level, a degree of recovery lower than the province as a whole. In Alberta, employment rose by 38,000 (+1.8%) in September, nearly all in full-time work. Educational services, information, culture and recreation, and public administration contributed the most to the increase. The unemployment rate was little changed at 11.7% as more people participated in the labour market. Alberta had the slowest employment growth rate of all provinces in 2019 at 0.5%, compared with the national growth rate of 2.1%. In Manitoba, employment increased for the fifth consecutive month, up 15,000 in September, while the unemployment rate fell 1.1 percentage points to 7.0%. In Atlantic Canada, Nova Scotia reported the largest employment gain in September, up 12,000 (+2.7%), continuing the upward trend that began five months earlier. Employment in Nova Scotia was within 3.2% of its February level and the unemployment rate fell 2.4 percentage points to 7.9%. After notable increases in May and June, employment in New Brunswick has changed little in recent months and held steady in September. The unemployment rate rose 1.0 percentage points in September to 10.4% as more people searched for work. In Prince Edward Island, employment fell slightly (-800) following four successive monthly gains. The unemployment rate in September was 10.1%. Chart 8 Employment increases in most provinces in September but remains below February levels Quarterly update for the territories The Labour Force Survey collects labour market data in the territories, produced in the form of three-month moving averages. In the third quarter ending in September, employment in Yukon held steady, following a decline of 1,200 in the second quarter. The unemployment rate remained at 6.2%. Over the same period, employment as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older was little changed at 65.0%. Following a decline of 1,300 in the second quarter, employment in the Northwest Territories was little changed in the third quarter. The unemployment rate was 9.4%. Employment in Nunavut increased by an estimated 1,100 people in the third quarter, partly offsetting the decline in the previous quarter. Employment as a percentage of the population rose from 44.8% in the second quarter to 48.7% in the third quarter. The unemployment rate was little changed at 16.0%. September unemployment rates similar in Canada and the United States The COVID-19 global pandemic has profoundly impacted the economies and labour markets of countries around the world. While comparisons of these impacts are challenging due to differences in concepts, survey design and reference periods, comparisons between the labour market situations of Canada and the United States can be made by carefully adjusting Canadian data to US concepts. For more information on Canada-US comparisons, see ""Measuring Employment and Unemployment in Canada and the United States – A comparison."" Adjusted to US concepts, the unemployment rate in Canada was 7.9% in September, the same as the rate reported in the United States. The Canadian rate was 3.3 percentage points higher than in February, while the American rate was 4.4 percentage points higher. At the same time, the employment rate (the number of employed as a percentage of the working age population) was 59.7% in Canada and 56.6% in the United States in September. The Canadian employment rate was 2.7 percentage points lower in September than in February, compared with 4.5 percentage points lower in the United States. The labour force participation rate in Canada was 64.8% in September, 0.6 percentage points lower than it was in February. In the United States, the participation rate was 61.4%, 2.0 percentage points lower than in February. Looking ahead: Upcoming changes to economic support benefits CERB recipients more likely to be in households with financial difficulties In March and April, the federal government introduced a number of programs, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) to help Canadians adjust to the impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown. From August to September, the proportion of Canadians receiving CERB, CESB, or regular Employment Insurance (EI) payments fell from 16.1% to 13.5%. The relatively slow recovery of self-employment—and the number of hours worked by self-employed Canadians—is reflected in the profile of those receiving COVID-19 support payments. In September, one in five (21.8%) CERB recipients were either currently self-employed or had been self-employed in the last 12 months. The proportion of CERB recipients living in a household experiencing difficulty meeting its necessary expenses increased to 42.0%, up 4.3 percentage points from August. On September 27, some CERB recipients transitioned to the EI program. The federal government has announced that it intends to introduce new support programs for CERB recipients who are not eligible for EI, including the Canada Recovery Benefit for self-employed workers. As part of Statistics Canada's commitment to understanding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the labour market, the LFS will continue to monitor the extent to which Canadians take advantage of these COVID-19 economic support programs.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for September are for the week of September 13 to 19. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey"". This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. Since March 2020, LFS collection operations have been adapted to ensure that high quality information is collected in a way which protects the health and safety of both Statistics Canada interviewers and respondents. All face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone or online interviews. In addition, all telephone interviews have been conducted by interviewers working from their home rather than Statistics Canada's call centres. As was the case in June, July and August, approximately 40,000 interviews were completed in September. To provide advice and guidance on future adaptations to LFS collection strategies, and the quality of LFS information, Statistics Canada has created a Labour Force Survey Expert Panel. Membership of this panel will be announced in the coming weeks. The distribution of LFS interviews in September 2020 compared with August 2020, was as follows: Personal face-to-face interviews • August 2020 0.0% • September 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from call centres • August 2020 0.0% • September 2020 0.0% Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • August 2020 69.2% • September 2020 67.4% Online interviews • August 2020 30.8% • September 2020 32.6% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in September 2020 analysis To continue capturing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the supplementary indicators used in March and April have been slightly adapted. Therefore, the May to September supplementary indicators are not directly comparable to the supplementary indicators published in April and March 2020. Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Time-related underemployment rate combines people who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours as a proportion of all employed people. New information on population groups Beginning in July, the LFS includes a question asking respondents to report the population groups to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2016 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Other For LFS records interviewed before July, population group characteristics were assigned using an experimental sample matching data integration method. This involved directly integrating LFS and census information for approximately 20% of LFS records. For the remaining 80%, population group characteristics were assigned using information available at the population level from both LFS and census. Further development of this method will continue in the coming months. According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, data for the population who identify as Aboriginals are analyzed separately. The remaining category is described as ""people not designated as visible minorities"" or ""people who are not a visible minority."" Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Next release The next release of the LFS will be on November 6.

By the end of May, many businesses had begun to adapt to the new reality by shifting to teleworking, reducing hours, laying off staff, applying for government funding or seeking rent relief. As pandemic-related restrictions were gradually lifted throughout the summer, the business climate began to improve slightly. For example, real gross domestic product grew 1.2% in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, which continued to offset the steepest drops in Canadian economic activity on record that were observed in March and April. Nevertheless, challenges remain, especially in light of the resurgence of COVID-19 and a return to partial shutdowns in several provinces. From mid-September to late October, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions to collect information the pandemic's impact on businesses throughout the summer, and on businesses' expectations moving forward. Although almost two-fifths of businesses had laid off staff since the start of the pandemic, around three-quarters expected to retain the same number of employees over the next three months, and had the cash or liquid assets required to operate. Conversely, over two-fifths of businesses could not take on more debt. Nearly one-fifth of businesses expected to raise prices, and 5.2% reported that they were actively considering bankruptcy or closure. Layoffs during the pandemic Almost two-fifths (36.5%) of businesses had laid off at least one employee since the start of the pandemic. Of businesses that had laid off at least one employee, almost two-thirds (64.3%) had laid off half or more of their workforce. Of businesses that reported layoffs, the majority in the arts, entertainment and recreation (84.0%), health care and social assistance (80.6%), and accommodation and food services (74.0%) sectors reported laying off half or more of their workforce. Just over half (53.8%) of businesses that had laid off staff reported hiring back 50% or more of their workforce. The majority of businesses expect to retain the same number of employees over the next three months Nearly three-quarters (74.1%) of businesses expected their number of employees to remain the same over the next three months, while 10.4% expected their number of employees to decrease. Over one-quarter of businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector (28.9%) and almost one-quarter of businesses in the accommodation and food services sector (22.5%) expected to reduce their number of employees over the next three months, the highest proportions among all sectors. Some businesses expect to raise prices over the next three months Almost one-fifth (18.1%) of businesses expected to raise prices over the next three months, including over one-quarter of businesses in the retail trade (31.1%) and construction (27.8%) sectors. In contrast, 5.1% of all businesses expected to lower prices. Liquidity and ability to take on more debt Over three-quarters (76.9%) of businesses had the cash or liquid assets required to operate. Over two-fifths (43.9%) of businesses reported that they were unable to take on more debt, while nearly one-fifth (19.4%) could not say whether they could take on more debt. Close to three-fifths (57.0%) of businesses in the accommodation and food services sector reported that they were unable to take on more debt. Outlook on business operations Close to one-third (30.4%) of businesses did not know how long they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures before considering further staffing actions, closure or bankruptcy, while nearly one-fifth (17.5%) reported they could continue for less than six months. Approximately one-third of businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation (29.4%) and accommodation and food services (29.2%) sectors reported that they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than six months before considering further staffing actions, closure or bankruptcy. Business revenues Almost one-third (30.8%) of businesses reported that their revenues from August 2020 were down 30% or more, year over year. Less than one-fifth (15.5%) of businesses reported that their revenues were down by half or more. Nearly half (46.9%) of businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector reported that their revenues were down 40% or more. Conversely, over half of businesses in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (54.2%), real estate and rental and leasing (53.7%), and finance and insurance (53.0%) sectors reported either no change or an increase in revenue. Just over one-third (36.4%) of businesses did not expect their revenues to be higher over the next three months compared with the previous three months. Over half of the businesses in the accommodation and food services (55.6%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (54.9%) sectors did not expect their revenues to be higher. Over one-quarter (27.5%) of businesses were uncertain about their revenues over the next three months. Special accommodations for employees who are parents Nearly three-fifths (59.4%) of businesses where not all work could be performed on a flexible schedule or where schools and child-care facilities were not expected to have a normal schedule during the fall were providing or considering providing special accommodations for parents. Over two-fifths (41.8%) of these businesses allowed or would allow parents to change their schedules; over one-quarter (27.5%) allowed or would allow parents to telework or work remotely; and close to one-quarter (23.7%) allowed or would allow parents to switch to part-time status on a temporary or limited basis. Teleworking or working remotely during and after the pandemic Teleworking and working remotely have become more prevalent since the start of the pandemic. Over one-third (35.3%) of businesses reported that teleworking or working remotely was a possibility for their employees. Of these businesses, over one-quarter (27.2%) reported that all of their workforce was teleworking or working remotely on August 31, 2020. Once the pandemic is over, 14.7% of businesses anticipate that all of their workforce will continue to primarily telework or work remotely. For businesses that indicated that teleworking was potentially applicable to their workforce, over one-quarter (28.3%) reported being likely or very likely to permanently offer more employees the possibility of teleworking or working remotely once the pandemic is over, while 12.7% were likely or very likely to require it.

November Labour Force Survey (LFS) results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of November 8 to 14. In September and October, many provinces began introducing targeted public health measures in response to rising COVID-19 numbers. In early November, restrictions related to indoor dining and fitness facilities were eased in Ontario, while in Manitoba new measures affecting restaurants, recreational facilities and retail businesses were introduced. Much of Quebec remained at the ""red"" alert level in November, leading to the ongoing closure of indoor dining and many recreational and cultural facilities. Highlights Employment growth continues to slow Employment rose by 0.3% in November, following an increase of 0.5% in October. From May to September, employment grew by an average of 2.7% per month. Full-time employment rose by 99,000 in November, while part-time work was little changed. Among those who worked at least half of their usual hours, 4.6 million worked from home in November. Growth in self-employment stalled in November and compared to public sector and private sector employees, employment in this group remained furthest from the February pre-COVID level (-4.7%; -136,000). Total hours worked rose by 1.2% in November. Since May, total hours worked has recovered steadily as the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown has given way to more limited and targeted public health measures. Unemployment rate continues to fall from May peak The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 8.5% in November, continuing the steady fall from the record high 13.7% in May. Approximately 317,000 Canadians who were unemployed in October exited the labour force in November. A higher number (372,000) transitioned from unemployment to employment. The number of people who were on temporary layoff, or who had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future, stood at 253,000, a drop of 78.9% from April. Following increases of 79,000 (+36.2%) in September and 151,000 (+50.7%) in October, long-term unemployment held steady in November. A total of 443,000 Canadians, or one-quarter (25.6%) of all the unemployed, had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more. After surging after the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, from 11.2% in February to 36.1% in April, the labour underutilization rate has fallen every month since May, including a 0.3 percentage point drop to 16.9% in November. Varying labour market conditions across provinces and industries Employment increased in six provinces: Ontario, British Columbia and in all four Atlantic provinces. Manitoba experienced its first employment loss since April, while the number of people with a job or business held steady in Quebec, Saskatchewan and Alberta. By November, employment in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had returned to pre-COVID levels. Following little change in October, employment growth resumed in the goods-producing sector (+44,000; +1.2%) in November, with most of the increase in construction. For the first time since the recovery began in May, employment in the services-producing sector was little changed. Employment in information, culture and recreation declined by 26,000 (-3.5%), the first notable decline for this industry since April. Employment in accommodation and food services declined for the second consecutive month, falling by 24,000 (-2.4%) in November. Employment in construction rose by 26,000 (+1.9%), the first increase since July. After pausing in October, employment growth resumed in transportation and warehousing (+20,000; +2.1%). In natural resources, employment rose for the second consecutive month, increasing 3.1% (+10,000) and returning to its pre-COVID level. Employment growth also variable among demographic groups Employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) was unchanged in November after six consecutive months of growth. Employment among core-aged men (25 to 54 years old) rose by 23,000 (+0.4%). Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 rose 0.9% (+20,000), while the youth unemployment rate fell 1.4 percentage points to 17.4%. Employment increased among young men and was little changed for young women. Employment among workers aged 55 and older increased by 23,000 (+0.6%) in November after holding steady in October. Employment among Indigenous people living off-reserve was little changed from October. Among Canadians aged 15 to 69, the unemployment rate of those designated as a visible minority decreased 1.5 percentage points to 10.2% in November. About half of the decline in unemployment among those designated as visible minorities was accounted for by South Asian Canadians (not seasonally adjusted). Employment growth continues to slow Employment rose by 62,000 (+0.3%) in November, following an increase of 84,000 (+0.5%) in October. From May to September, employment grew by an average of 2.7% per month. The unemployment rate was 8.5% in November, down 0.4 percentage points from a month earlier. Employment growth continued to vary across industries in November. Employment fell in industries most directly affected by public health restrictions, notably in accommodation and food services. On the other hand, employment continued to approach or exceed pre-COVID levels in industries where working from home or physical distancing is more feasible, such as professional, scientific and technical services. By April, the initial widespread COVID-19 economic shutdown had directly affected 5.5 million Canadian workers, including 3.0 million who had lost employment and 2.5 million who remained employed but had experienced COVID-related absences from work. By November, the equivalent figure was 1.0 million, including a 574,000 (-3.0%) drop in employment since February and a 448,000 (+55.5%) increase since February in Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours. Chart 1 Pace of employment recovery slows Gains in full-time work Full-time employment rose by 99,000 (+0.7%) in November, while part-time work was little changed. Compared with pre-COVID February levels, full-time employment was down 2.9%, compared with a decrease of 3.3% for part-time work. Among those who worked part time in November, more than one-fifth (22.6%; 808,000) wanted full-time work (30 hours or more per week) but were unable to find it. This was up 5.2 percentage points from 12 months earlier, with above-average increases among men aged 25 to 54 (up 13.2 percentage points to 46.4%) (not seasonally adjusted). Number of Canadians working from home increases for the second consecutive month Among those who worked at least half of their usual hours, 4.6 million Canadians worked from home in November. This was an increase of approximately 250,000 from October and included 2.5 million who do not usually work from home. Among the same group, the number of people working at locations other than home fell by approximately 100,000 to 12.2 million. Hospitals and schools drive growth in public sector employment The number of public sector employees grew by 32,000 (+0.8%) in November and exceeded its pre-COVID February level by 1.5%. On a year-over-year basis, the number of public sector workers was up 61,000 (+1.6%), driven mostly by increases in hospitals and elementary and secondary schools (not seasonally adjusted). The number of private sector employees was little changed in November, but was down by 411,000 (-3.3%) compared with 12 months earlier. This decline was largest in accommodation and food services, while employment in professional, scientific and technical services increased. Growth in self-employment stalled in November and this group remained furthest from November 2019 (-4.5%; -131,000) and from the February pre-COVID level (-4.7%; -136,000). Chart 2 Increased employment in hospitals and schools drives public sector employment over pre-COVID level Total hours worked continue to grow Along with employment, total hours worked across all industries is a core indicator of the state of the labour market. In general, total hours worked can be influenced by a number of factors such as employment growth, compositional change in employment by industry and occupation, and changes in absences from work. From February to April, employment losses and COVID-related absences from work contributed to a drop of more than one-quarter (-27.7%) in the total number of hours worked across all industries. Since May, total hours worked has recovered steadily as the initial widespread COVID-19 economic shutdown has given way to more limited and targeted public health measures. From October to November, total hours worked rose by 1.2%, continuing the recent trend. Despite this increase in the month, total hours worked was 5.0% lower than in February, with about one-quarter (27.1%) of the net deficit being in accommodation and food services. Construction, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale and retail trade also contributed notably to the February-to-November decline. Unemployment rate continues to fall from May peak The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 8.5% in November, continuing the steady fall from the record high 13.7% in May. The unemployment rate in February was 5.6%, just prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown. The total number of unemployed fell 4.5% to 1.7 million November (-82,000), also continuing the downward trend from the May peak. Approximately 317,000 Canadians who were unemployed in October exited the labour force in November. A higher number (372,000) transitioned from unemployment to employment. Chart 3 Unemployment rate continues to drop from May's record high Unemployment rate among visible minorities falls in November Among Canadians aged 15 to 69, the unemployment rate of those designated as a visible minority decreased 1.5 percentage points to 10.2% in November (not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the unemployment rate among those who are not Indigenous and not a member of a group designated as a visible minority increased by 0.2 percentage points to 6.9% (not seasonally adjusted). About half of the decline in unemployment among those designated as visible minorities was accounted for by South Asian Canadians, whose unemployment rate fell by 3.3 percentage points to 10.5%. At the same time, there were employment gains among South Asian Canadians, with the vast majority (87%) of the increase in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, and more than half (57.9%) in sales and service occupations (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate also fell in November among Southeast Asian Canadians (-3.8 percentage points to 8.7%), while there was little change among the other five largest groups designated as visible minorities (not seasonally adjusted). Temporary layoffs remain high in some industries The spike in unemployment resulting from the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown was driven partly by an unprecedented increase in the number of people on temporary layoff. This number peaked at 1.2 million in April, before falling steadily over the summer and early fall as public health measures were eased. In November, the number of people who were on temporary layoff, or who had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future, stood at 253,000, a drop of 78.9% from April. About one-quarter (26.6%) of people on temporary layoff in November last worked in the accommodation and food services industry (not seasonally adjusted), reflecting the continuing challenges faced by this sector in adjusting to new and continuing public health measures. The wholesale and retail trade (11.8%) and manufacturing (11.6%) industries also accounted for a sizable share of those on temporary layoff. Across all industries, men in the core working age group of 25 to 54 accounted for almost 3 in 10 (28.0%; 71,000) of those on temporary layoff. Job search strategies shift as a large number of Canadians continue to look for work As the number of people on temporary layoff fell over the summer and early fall, the number of job searchers increased and made up an increasing share of the total unemployed. Despite a drop in the month (-39,000; -2.6%), there were 1.5 million job searchers in November, almost half a million more than in February (+448,000; +43.3%). Nearly one in three job searchers in November (432,000; 29.1%) were men in the core working age group of 25 to 54. The most common occupations of job searchers who had worked in the past 12 months included sales and services occupations (36.6%), and occupations related to trades, transport and equipment operators (19.5%) (not seasonally adjusted). Most of the increase in job searchers from February to November was among those in the core-age group of 25 to 54, with 135,000 (+45.3%) more men and 105,000 (+39.6%) more women looking for work. There were 154,000 (+56.3%) more youth searching for work in November than in February, with the increase split between male and female youth. The large increase in job searchers observed since the summer highlights the importance of the various strategies used by the unemployed to make their way back to employment. In November, close to 8 in 10 job searchers (77.5%) looked at job advertisements, up 11.4 percentage points from 12 months earlier (not seasonally adjusted). The share of those looking for work who used public or private employment agencies fell 2.3 percentage points year over year to 19.0%, while the share who relied on friends or family to find job opportunities increased 6.6 percentage points to 32.4%. Long-term unemployed face increased risk of financial difficulty Following increases of 79,000 (+36.2%) in September and 151,000 (+50.7%) in October, long-term unemployment held steady in November. A total of 443,000 Canadians, or one-quarter (25.6%) of all the unemployed, had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more. Workers who became unemployed as a result of previous economic downturns have experienced a range of long-term consequences, including long-term reduction in earnings. Those who entered into a prolonged period of joblessness in recent months are a direct reflection of the unprecedented job losses which resulted from the COVID-19 economic shutdown of March and April, and may face a unique set of short-term and long-term challenges. In November, more than half (53.3%) of the long-term unemployed lived in a household reporting difficulty meeting necessary expenses (not seasonally adjusted). This was higher than the proportion of those with a shorter jobless spell (41.4%) and noticeably higher than the proportion (19.3%) of those who were employed or not in the labour force (not seasonally adjusted). While core-aged people comprised the greatest share (53.9%) of long-term unemployment in November, their contribution was down 4.7 percentage points compared with 12 months earlier. People aged 55 and older, on the other hand, made up a larger share of the long-term unemployed than a year ago—26.2%, up 5.3 percentage points—suggesting that some older workers may be experiencing particular challenges in returning to employment. Youth accounted for one-fifth (20.0%) of the long-term unemployed, down 0.7 percentage points from 12 months earlier. Labour underutilization continues to fall but remains above pre-COVID level Since March, the labour underutilization rate—which reflects the proportion of people in the potential labour force who are either unemployed, want a job but have not looked for one, or are employed but working less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19—has served as an overall indicator of the impact of COVID-19 on labour market conditions. After surging in the wake of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, from 11.2% in February to 36.1% in April, the labour underutilization rate has fallen every month since May, including a 0.3 percentage point decline to 16.9% in November. In November, job searchers accounted for 42.0% of labour underutilization, while those who wanted a job but didn't look for one and those who were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to start a job in the near future made up 15.4% and 7.1% of the total, respectively. The remaining 35.5% of labour underutilization was the result of those who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours in November. Infographic 1 Labour underutilization remains high as more Canadians search for jobs or work reduced hours Varying labour market conditions across provinces As jurisdictions adjusted public health restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases, labour market conditions varied across Canada during the week of November 8 to 14. Employment increased in six provinces: Ontario, British Columbia and in all four Atlantic provinces. Manitoba experienced its first employment loss since April, while the number of people with a job or business held steady in Quebec, Saskatchewan and Alberta. By November, employment levels in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had returned to pre-COVID levels. Employment was nearest February levels in British Columbia (-1.5%) in November and farthest in Manitoba (-4.8%) and Alberta (-4.9%). For further information on key province-level and industry-level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" Infographic 2 Employment furthest from pre-COVID level in Alberta and Manitoba Employment growth continues to slow in Central Canada Following average monthly employment growth of 3.1% from June to September, Ontario saw a slowing of growth in October. This continued in November, as employment rose by 37,000 (+0.5%), mostly in full-time work. Employment in the Toronto CMA was at a standstill in November after increasing for five consecutive months. The Ontario unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 9.1%. The largest employment gain was in construction, an industry not affected by recent restrictions, while there were declines in accommodation and food services amid the tightening of public health measures in the City of Toronto and Region of Peel. Employment in Quebec was little changed for the second consecutive month. In the Montréal CMA, employment was flat for the second consecutive month following average monthly growth of 3.8% from May to September. The Quebec unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 7.2% as fewer people were on temporary layoff. Employment fell in accommodation and food services and information, culture and recreation, coinciding with the targeted public health measures in place since October. Employment increased in professional, scientific and technical services. Continued employment growth in British Columbia Just prior to the start of LFS reference week of November 8 to 14, the Vancouver Coastal Health Region and the Fraser Health Region introduced new restrictions on social gatherings, travel, and gyms and indoor sports facilities, as well as new COVID-related workplace safety requirements. Despite these new restrictions, employment in British Columbia grew by 24,000 (+1.0%) in November, adding to the gains over the previous six months (+335,000). Gains in full-time work were partly offset by losses in part-time employment. Several industries saw increases, including accommodation and food services, transportation and warehousing, wholesale and retail trade, and construction. The unemployment rate fell 0.9 percentage points to 7.1%. Employment grew (+1.2%) in the Vancouver CMA, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous two months. More people working in Atlantic Canada Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick all had employment gains in November. Nova Scotia posted the largest employment increase among the Atlantic provinces, up 10,000 (+2.2%), continuing the upward trend since April. The increase in November was mostly in full-time work. The unemployment rate fell 2.3 percentage points to 6.4%, the lowest since March 2019 and the lowest among the provinces. New Brunswick posted its first significant employment gain (+4,200; +1.2%) since the substantial increases in May and June. The increase in November was nearly all in full-time work and the unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 9.6%. Employment in Newfoundland and Labrador rose for the seventh consecutive month, up 2,300 (+1.0%) in November, and regained all of the losses sustained since February. The unemployment rate in November was little changed at 12.2%. Industries with employment losses at the start of the pandemic such as natural resources, construction and manufacturing saw small increases in subsequent months and offset the declines in March and April. Others, such as healthcare and social assistance and public administration continued to gain employment in recent months, pushing their employment above February levels. Prince Edward Island also had more people working in November (+1,000; +1.3%) and the unemployment rate was 10.2%. Employment losses in Manitoba Employment in Manitoba decreased by 18,000 in November, nearly all in part-time work. This was the first notable decline since April and coincided with tighter public health measures introduced in early November for the Winnipeg metropolitan region and for the rest of the province by the time of the LFS reference week. The largest employment decrease was in accommodation and food services. The unemployment rate was little changed in November at 7.4% as fewer Manitobans participated in the labour market. In both Saskatchewan and Alberta, there was little employment change in November. As of the LFS reference week of November 8 to November 14, both provinces had largely avoided introducing tighter public health measures. The unemployment rate in Saskatchewan increased 0.5 percentage points to 6.9%, with more people looking for work, while the Alberta unemployment rate was little changed at 11.1%. Employment growth continues to vary across industries Following little change in October, employment growth resumed in the goods-producing sector (+44,000; +1.2%) in November, with most of the increase in construction. For the first time since the recovery began in May, employment in the services-producing sector was little changed in November. Employment fell in two industries—information, culture and recreation; and accommodation and food services—as these industries continued to face the headwinds of new and continuing public health measures. These losses were offset by gains in industries less directly affected by the restrictions in place as of the LFS reference week, including retail trade; transportation and warehousing; and finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing. Employment declines in information, culture and recreation and accommodation and food services In November, employment in information, culture and recreation declined by 26,000 (-3.5%), the first notable decline for this industry since April. Employment fell for a second consecutive month in Quebec, where restrictions on public gatherings had been notably tightened as of the LFS reference week. At the national level, employment in information, culture and recreation was 10.5% lower in November than in February. Chart 4 Declines in information, culture and recreation and in accommodation and food services dampen overall employment increase Employment in accommodation and food services declined for the second consecutive month, falling by 24,000 (-2.4%) in November, with the drop being shared between Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec. Nearly 1 in 10 (8.9%) employees in accommodation and food services worked less than half their usual hours in November—the third highest share among all industries, following business, building and other support services (10.3%), and transportation and warehousing (9.2%) (not seasonally adjusted). Infographic 3 Employment furthest from recovery in accommodation and food services In the face of new and continuing public health measures to control the spread of COVID-19, employers in accommodation and food services are likely to continue to face a number of challenges. From mid-September to late October, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions to collect information on businesses' expectations moving forward. Almost one-quarter of businesses in accommodation and food services (22.5%) expected to reduce their number of employees over the next three months, more than double the average across all businesses (10.4%). Second consecutive employment increase in retail trade In retail trade, employment grew for the second consecutive month, rising 1.5% in November (+32,000), with most of the month-over-month increase in Ontario. Shutdowns of in-person shopping at non-essential retailers were introduced in Toronto and Peel on November 23, after the LFS reference week, and may be reflected in the December LFS results. December results may also shed light on the effect of tighter restrictions in other provinces such as Manitoba and Alberta. At the national level, the employment increase in November brought retail trade to within 3.7% of its pre-COVID employment level. Employment growth resumes for construction and transportation and warehousing Employment in construction rose by 26,000 (+1.9%) in November, the first increase since July, largely due to a 5.5% (+28,000) increase in Ontario. Nationally, employment in construction was 5.7% below its February level. After pausing in October, employment growth resumed in transportation and warehousing in November (+20,000; +2.1%). The increase was largely the result of gains in Ontario and British Columbia, bringing employment in this industry to within 6.4% of its pre-COVID level. Finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing now exceeding pre-COVID employment levels Employment rose for the third consecutive month in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing, up by 15,000 (+1.2%). The recent employment growth in this industry pushed it fully into recovery territory, surpassing its February level by 2.3%. Employment up in natural resources for the second consecutive month In natural resources, employment rose for the second consecutive month, rising 3.1% in November (+10,000) and returning to its pre-COVID level. The month-over-month gain was nearly equally split between Alberta and British Columbia. Data for this industry over the next few months may shed light on the impact of Alberta ending its limits on oil production in December, allowing producers to utilize available pipeline capacity and increase employment. Employment growth stalls for core-aged women Total employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) was unchanged in November after six consecutive months of growth. Gains in full-time work (+49,000; +1.0%) were offset by losses in part-time employment (-52,000; -5.0%).Despite this lack of growth in the month, employment was closer to its pre-COVID February level among core-aged women (-1.5%) than among all other major demographic groups. Year-over-year declines in employment by industry—which account for typical seasonal variations—were greatest in accommodation and food services; business, building and other support services; and other services. These declines were partially offset by year-over-year gains in the finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing industry, and in educational services (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate for core-aged women was little changed in November at 6.8%, up 2.2 percentage points compared with February. After returning to its pre-COVID level in September, the participation rate for women in the core age group remained stable at 83.8% in November, well above the recent low of 77.8% in April. Core-aged men see gains in part-time work Employment among core-aged men (aged 25 to 54) rose by 23,000 (+0.4%) in November, driven entirely by an increase in part-time employment and bringing employment for this demographic group to within 1.7% of its pre-COVID level. On a year-over-year basis, the majority of the employment declines among core-aged men occurred in construction, accommodation and food services, and transportation and warehousing. The unemployment rate for core-aged men was 7.3% in November, down 0.3 percentage points from October but still higher than the pre-pandemic rate of 4.8% in February. After returning to pre-COVID levels in September, the labour force participation rate for core-aged men was unchanged from October at 91.6%. Mothers continue to experience COVID-related losses in hours, despite employment returning to pre-shutdown levels As children returned to school in August and September, attention focused on how parents were adapting to balancing work and childcare responsibilities with new school routines, whether online learning at home or returning to the classroom. Fully understanding these impacts requires a range of labour indicators available from the LFS—particularly employment and absences from work—as well as non-labour indicators from other sources. In September, employment returned to pre-pandemic levels among both core-aged mothers and core-aged fathers of children less than 18 years old. This situation continued in November, with little year-over-year employment change in either group. Patterns in absences from work, however, indicate that mothers may be experiencing different challenges than fathers, particularly among parents whose youngest child was under 13 years of age. On a year-over-year basis, there were 54.9% more mothers in this group working less than half their usual hours in November, compared with 41.3% more fathers (not seasonally adjusted). These absences include those related to personal circumstances, such as caring for children, as well as those related to job situation, such as reduced shifts. In the November LFS, respondents were asked whether they had any concerns related to caring for children or other family members in the context of the ongoing pandemic. The specific nature and impact of these concerns may vary based on each family's particular childcare, schooling, and employment situation. Among core-aged parents whose youngest child was under 13 years of age, the share citing caregiving concerns was higher among job searchers (41.7%) than among those who were employed (32.9%). Mothers (35.3%) were somewhat more likely than fathers (30.0%) to cite concerns related to caregiving. Employment farther from pre-COVID level for female youth than male counterparts Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 rose 0.9% (+20,000) in November, while the youth unemployment rate fell 1.4 percentage points to 17.4%. Fewer youth aged 15 to 24 were in the labour force in November, as the participation rate fell 0.6 percentage points to 63.6%, with the decrease entirely among young women (-1.2 percentage points). The share of youth attending school was up 1.8 percentage points (from 62.1% to 63.9%) compared with 12 months earlier (not seasonally adjusted). Employment increased among young men (+14,000; +1.2%) in November, with gains in full-time employment (+34,000; +5.1%) only partly offset by losses in part-time work (-19,000; -3.8%). Among female youth, in contrast, employment was little changed in the month. The labour market impact of COVID-19 has been particularly challenging for young women, who experienced greater initial COVID-related employment losses in March and April. As of November, employment for this group remained farther (-11.0%) from pre-pandemic February levels than that of all other major demographic groups. Similarly, while the unemployment rate of young men (18.2%) remained higher than for all the major demographic groups in November, the year-over-year increase in the unemployment rate was higher for young women (+6.6 percentage points) than young men (+5.1 percentage points). Chart 5 Employment farther from pre-COVID level for female youth than male counterparts On a year-over-year basis, youth employment was down by one-third (-33.0%) in information, culture and recreation, and by one-quarter (-25.8%) in accommodation and food services in November (not seasonally adjusted). Year-over-year losses in these two industries, which typically account for about one-quarter of youth employment (25.4% in 2019), were partially offset by a gain in the construction industry, where employment was up on a year-over-year basis. Chart 6 Youth unemployment rates remain high in November Employment increases for Canadians aged 55 and older Employment among workers aged 55 and older increased by 23,000 (+0.6%) in November after holding steady in October. Gains were primarily among older women, with employment little changed for men in this age group. Nevertheless, employment for older workers remained 3.2% below February levels, with employment for older men (-2.5%) closer to pre-pandemic levels than for older women (-4.1%). By industry, the largest year-over-year employment declines for older men were among those who worked in retail trade and construction. For women, losses were most notable in healthcare and social assistance, and the other services industry (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate for workers aged 55 and older decreased by 0.8 percentage points to 7.1% in November. Employment rate among very recent immigrants remains closest to February levels In November, the employment rate of immigrants who landed in Canada more than five years ago (58.1%) was 1.2 percentage points below its pre-COVID February level, closer than the rate for those born in Canada (59.7%), which was down 1.7 percentage points (not seasonally adjusted). For more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant employment, see Transitions into and out of employment by immigrants during the COVID-19 lockdown and recovery. The employment rate of very recent immigrants—those who landed in Canada in the past five years—was 65.6% in November, little changed from its pre-COVID February level (not seasonally adjusted). The labour market situation of this group has been impacted by COVID-related restrictions on international travel, which have led to a sudden reduction in new immigrants to Canada. For more information on recent changes in international migration resulting from COVID-19 public health measures, see Canada's population estimates: Age and sex, July 1, 2020. Employment recovery stalls for Indigenous people Employment among Indigenous people living off-reserve was little changed from October. Employment for Indigenous people remained further from February levels (-5.5%) than non-Indigenous Canadians (-1.6%). For more information, see Labour market impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous people: March to August 2020. Looking ahead As the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic enters a new phase—with COVID-19 caseloads increasing and the holiday season approaching—Statistics Canada remains committed to informing Canadians on the wide range of labour market challenges, faced by employers, workers and families.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for November are for the week of November 8 to 14. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. Since March 2020, all face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both interviewers and respondents. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. As has been the case each month since June, approximately 40,000 interviews were completed in November. The distribution of LFS interviews in November 2020 compared with October 2020, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • October 2020: 67.8% • November 2020: 67.5% Online interviews • October 2020: 32.2% • November 2020: 32.5% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in November 2020 analysis To continue capturing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the supplementary indicators used in March and April were slightly adapted. Therefore, the May to November supplementary indicators are not directly comparable to the supplementary indicators published in April and March 2020. Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Time-related underemployment rate combines people who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours as a proportion of all employed people. Information on population groups Beginning in July, the LFS includes a question asking respondents to report the population groups to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2016 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other For LFS records interviewed before July, population group characteristics were assigned using an experimental sample matching data integration method, which involves LFS and the Census of Population This historical data complements population group data collected directly in LFS, through a comparison of year-over-year changes in the unemployment rate. According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, data for the population who identify as Aboriginals are analyzed separately. The remaining category is described as ""people not designated as visible minorities"" or ""people who are not a visible minority."" Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). To ensure that the LFS reflects current labour market conditions as accurately as possible, data are revised following each census to reflect the most recently available population estimates and to correspond with current Standard Geographic Classification boundaries. This standard revision process results in minor changes to recent and historical LFS data and has little impact on trends in key labour market indicators, such as employment, unemployment, and labour force participation rates. Changes to LFS Common Output Data Repository tables and information products resulting from this historical revision will be announced in The Daily on January 25, 2021. Next release The next release of the LFS will be on January 8, 2021.

National net worth grows as non-financial assets increase National net worth, the sum of national wealth and Canada's net foreign asset position, increased $572.6 billion from the previous quarter to $13,236.9 billion in the third quarter. This was largely fuelled by gains in the value of non-financial assets and an improvement in Canada's net foreign asset position, which represents the difference between the value of Canada's assets and liabilities with the rest of the world. On a per capita basis, national net worth increased from $331,732 to $344,816. Canada's net foreign asset position increased by $94.4 billion to $1,170.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. For a second consecutive quarter, the increase was due to higher equity prices and was moderated by the revaluation effect from fluctuations in exchange rates as well as net borrowings from abroad. Canada's net foreign asset position has increased by $191.3 billion since the beginning of 2020. Because a greater share of Canada's international assets is in the form of equity instruments than in international liabilities, stock price fluctuations tend to have a greater impact on the value of assets. National wealth, the value of non-financial assets in the Canadian economy, rose 4.1% to $12,066.8 billion in the third quarter. The value of residential real estate increased 3.2%, the largest quarterly increase since 2017, as property prices rose and interest rates remained favorable. Natural resource wealth increased $237.0 billion, due to a rebound in energy prices and production following a weak first half of 2020. The value of consumer durables, including automobiles, was up $21.4 billion primarily due to strong consumer spending in the quarter. Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic In the third quarter, the Canadian economy showed signs of recovery following widespread production shutdowns and other restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in the year. Canadians relied less on government support measures as employee compensation partially rebounded and many Canadians returned to work. Government transfers dropped compared with the previous quarter, but still contributed to a second consecutive quarter of strong household savings. Funds to support these government programs were primarily financed through record bond sales and issuances of short-term paper. In the third quarter, governments once again sold a previously unprecedented volume of bonds while significantly reducing their overall debt in the form of shorter-term instruments. Consequently, government debt continued to grow, but at a substantially slower pace than in the previous quarter. After sharp declines in equity markets earlier in the year, stock markets gradually climbed toward their pre-pandemic valuations. Despite this market recovery, there remains uncertainty surrounding the Canadian economy as COVID-19 infection rates rise and some regions enter lockdowns. Households reversed course on consumption after the sharp decline in the previous quarter as their demand for non-mortgage loans similarly strengthened and mortgage borrowing remained robust in the face of elevated housing demand and low interest rates. Chart 1 Change in national net worth by component Household net lending positive again Household sector saving, the funds available to increase wealth, was $56.8 billion, remaining elevated for a second consecutive quarter, following a record $90.1 billion in the second quarter. On a seasonally adjusted basis, in the third quarter, Canadians relied less on income support programs, resulting in a nearly 50% reduction in employment insurance benefits, as employment climbed to within 3.7% of its pre-COVID February level. Increased compensation did not fully offset reduced government support, resulting in household disposable income falling 3.1%; however, household disposable income was still 9.2% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019. Rising wages, coupled with still-elevated government transfers, helped offset a strong rebound in household spending. The savings rate stood at 14.6%, down from a record 27.5% in the second quarter, but significantly higher than the long-run average. While a larger share of savings was directed toward investment in non-financial assets, such as housing, households were net lenders for a second consecutive quarter; this means their transactions in financial assets exceeded those in liabilities (i.e., borrowing) as households added financial wealth overall. Household sector net worth, the value of all assets less liabilities, increased 3.0% to $12,301.2 billion in the third quarter, following a record 5.3% rebound in the second quarter. The value of financial assets rose $188.6 billion, largely due to a $114.7 billion increase in the value of equity, including notable growth in the value of mutual fund shares. Similarly, the Toronto Stock Exchange was up 3.9%, following a 16.0% increase one quarter earlier. Meanwhile, financial liabilities grew 1.9%, primarily owing to a record increase in mortgage borrowing. The value of non-financial assets grew $214.6 billion, mostly due to an increase of $183.8 billion in residential real estate. After a precipitous decline in residential resale activity in the second quarter, the volume of sales in dollars rebounded 88.8% in the third quarter, while the number of units sold rose 67.0%, as resale activity resumed and pent-up demand spurred price increases. Year over year, sales volumes were 60.4% higher than in the third quarter of 2019, the strongest quarter since 2009. Despite slowed residential resale activity in the second quarter, 5.8% more units were sold in the first three quarters of 2020 than in the same period in 2019. The value of residential real estate increased 3.2%, as over one-quarter of Canadians who worked most of their usual hours worked from home at the end of the quarter. Housing investment, which includes new purchases, was also at its highest point on record. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the increase was led by ownership transfer costs (+137.4%) and, to a lesser extent, renovation activity (+20.3%). On the liability side, households financed home purchases with a record increase in mortgages in the third quarter as the cost of borrowing hovered at all-time lows. Chart 2 Household savings rate, seasonally adjusted Chart 3 Household credit market debt, seasonally adjusted flows Credit market borrowing rebounds On a seasonally adjusted basis, total credit market borrowing increased from $7.2 billion to $38.4 billion in the third quarter. After reducing non-mortgage debt by $19.2 billion in the second quarter, households returned to accruing this type of debt, with a net increase of $9.7 billion. Demand for mortgage loans rose to $28.7 billion, setting a new high after record mortgage borrowing in the second quarter. The interest portion of payment deferrals accruing to the existing mortgage balance of borrowers accounted for a portion of mortgage demand over the last three quarters, peaking in the second quarter and declining substantially since then. The stock of credit market debt (consumer credit, and mortgage and non-mortgage loans) totalled $2,417.4 billion at the end of the quarter. Mortgage debt was $1,627.8 billion. Non-mortgage loans stood at $789.5 billion. Overall, the amount of debt in deferral as a result of the various relief measures provided by lenders had dropped significantly by the end of the third quarter. On a per capita basis, credit market debt increased from $62,345 to $62,971. The household debt service ratio, measured as total obligated payments of principal and interest on credit market debt as a proportion of household disposable income, increased to 13.22% from 12.36%, following the largest decline on record. While payment deferrals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on obligated principal paid, deferrals with six-month durations began winding down late in the third quarter. Although interest payments continue to be recorded on an accrual basis, as a result of payment deferrals, the total obligated mortgage payments were nearly 20% lower in the second quarter than without these deferrals. However, by the third quarter this had dropped to under 10%. Household credit market debt as a proportion of household disposable income rose from 162.8% to 170.7%, as the stock of credit market debt increased 1.6% and household disposable income decreased 3.1%. In other words, there was $1.71 in credit market debt for every dollar of household disposable income, compared with $1.81 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Household debt is aggregated across all income brackets; however, in general, credit market debt to disposable income tends to be higher for lower income quintiles. Chart 4 Household credit market debt to household disposable income, seasonally adjusted Federal government borrowing slows The federal government demand for credit market debt was $0.6 billion in the third quarter, a marked decrease from the $302.1 billion in funds raised in the second quarter. Sizeable borrowing in the form of federal bonds continued in the third quarter with net issuances of $77.4 billion, but these were largely offset by net retirements of short-term paper (-$76.2 billion), marking a shift from short- to longer-term borrowing. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank of Canada has been a key counterparty for federal government borrowing. Additionally, the federal government recorded a substantial draw down in currency and deposits as support programs continued in the third quarter; this followed a record increase in the second quarter fuelled by proceeds from the sales of bonds and treasury bills. Other levels of government (excluding social security funds) decreased their borrowing from $65.4 billion in the second quarter to $24.6 billion in the third quarter, of which provincial bond issuances made up the largest share. Other levels of government also reduced their liability position in short-term paper through net retirements of $4.6 billion. The ratio of federal government net debt (the book value of total financial liabilities less total financial assets) to gross domestic product (GDP) increased to 34.0%. The ratio of other government net debt to GDP edged down from 27.1% to 26.9%. Chart 5 Net debt (book value) as a percentage of gross domestic product Non-financial private corporations shift sources of financing The demand for funds by non-financial private corporations was $24.0 billion in the third quarter, up from $10.5 billion in the previous quarter. The funds were raised primarily through the issuance of equity, a marked shift from the reliance on bond issuances in the previous quarter. Borrowing in the form of non-mortgage loans continued to decline from the record level reached during the first quarter of 2020. This retrenching was mainly due to reduced loans with chartered banks (-$22.4 billion), with a return to pre-pandemic levels of debt with this lending sector. On the other hand, non-residents (+$8.9 billion) and the federal government (+$3.9 billion) continued to provide funds to non-financial private corporations, including through government programs, such as the Canadian Emergency Business Account, which extends loans to businesses. The program is ongoing until the first quarter of 2021. The debt-to-equity ratio (at market value) of non-financial private corporations fell from 206.1% to 200.5%. Non-financial private corporations' equity rose more than debt, as stock prices continued to make up for market losses experienced in the first quarter of 2020. Chart 6 Demand for funds by private non-financial corporations Financial sector supply of funds declines The financial sector provided $23.3 billion in funds to the economy through financial market instruments, down from $307.8 billion in the previous quarter. Third quarter financing was mainly in the form of bonds (+$89.5 billion), which were largely offset by retirements of short-term paper (-$83.7 billion). Increased mortgage lending outweighed lower demand for non-mortgage loans. Following a strong first quarter of lending, outstanding non-mortgage loan assets posted two consecutive quarterly declines, a trend that has not been seen since the financial crisis, when non-mortgage loans contracted for five straight quarters. The Bank of Canada, a subsector of the financial sector and a significant purchaser of government debt since the beginning of the pandemic, continued to add to its asset holdings, although the Bank's purchasing programs have begun to scale back. The expansion was primarily the result of increased holdings of long-term debt securities, which were partially offset by a large scale retirement of short-term paper, predominantly with a three-month term, issued earlier in the pandemic. The market value of financial assets was up 2.1% to $17,471.3 billion. Holdings of equity and investment fund shares (+$322.6 billion) increased in the quarter, while currency and deposit assets, mainly held by chartered banks, grew $71.2 billion and loan assets fell $5.9 billion. Mutual funds, whose wealth is held predominantly by households, experienced upward revaluations and positive flows in foreign equity and listed shares as markets started to return to pre-pandemic levels.

An overview of these conceptual, methodological, and statistics revisions is available in ""An overview of revisions to the Financial and Wealth Accounts, 1990 to 2020."" In the near future, data enhancements to the national balance sheet and financial flow accounts, such as the development of detailed counterparty information by sector, will be incorporated. To facilitate this initiative and others, it is necessary to extend the annual revision period (normally the previous three years) at the time of the third quarter release. Consequently, for the next two years, with the third quarter release of the financial and wealth accounts, data will be revised back to 1990 to ensure a continuous time series. Financial and wealth accounts on a from-whom-to-whom basis: Selected financial instruments The data visualization product ""Financial accounts on a from-whom-to-whom basis, selected financial instruments"" has been updated with data from the first quarter of 1990 to the third quarter of 2020. Next release Data on the national balance sheet and financial flow accounts for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be released on March 12, 2021. Overview of the Financial and Wealth Accounts This release of the Financial and Wealth Accounts comprises the National Balance Sheet Accounts (NBSA), the Financial Flow Accounts (FFA), and the other changes in assets account. The NBSA are composed of the balance sheets of all sectors and subsectors of the economy. The main sectors are households, non-profit institutions serving households, financial corporations, non-financial corporations, government and non-residents. The NBSA cover all national non-financial assets and all financial asset-liability claims outstanding in all sectors. To improve the interpretability of financial flows data, selected household borrowing series are available on a seasonally adjusted basis (table 38-10-0238-01). All other data are unadjusted for seasonal variation. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The FFA articulate net lending or borrowing activity by sector by measuring financial transactions in the economy. The FFA arrive at a measure of net financial investment, which is the difference between transactions in financial assets and liabilities (for example, net purchases of securities less net issuances of securities). The FFA also provide the link between financial and non-financial activity in the economy, which ties estimates of saving and non-financial capital acquisition (for example, investment in new housing) to the underlying financial transactions. While the FFA record changes in financial assets and liabilities between opening and closing balance sheets that are associated with transactions during the accounting period, the value of assets and liabilities held by an institution can also change for other reasons. These other types of changes, referred to as other economic flows, are recorded in the other changes in assets account. There are two main components to this account. One is the other changes in the volume of assets account. This account includes changes in non-financial and financial assets and liabilities relating to the economic appearance and disappearance of assets, the effects of external events such as wars or catastrophes on the value of assets, and changes in the classification and structure of assets. The other main component is the revaluation account, showing holding gains or losses accruing to the owners of non-financial and financial assets and liabilities during the accounting period as a result of changes in market price valuations. At present, only the aggregate other change in assets is available within the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts; no details are available on the different components. Definitions concerning financial indicators can be found in Financial indicators from the National Balance Sheet Accounts and in the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts glossary. Distributions of Household Economic Accounts The NBSA for the household sector is allocated across a number of socioeconomic dimensions as part of the Distributions of Household Economic Accounts (DHEA). Data tables containing wealth and its components by income quintile, age, generation and region are available in tables 36-10-0585-01, 36-10-0586-01, 36-10-0589-01, and 36-10-0590-01. Methodology for DHEA wealth estimates can be found in the article ""Distributions of Household Economic Accounts, estimates of asset, liability and net worth distributions, 2010 to 2019: Technical methodology and quality report.""

November Labour Force Survey (LFS) results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of November 8 to 14. In September and October, many provinces began introducing targeted public health measures in response to rising COVID-19 numbers. In early November, restrictions related to indoor dining and fitness facilities were eased in Ontario, while in Manitoba new measures affecting restaurants, recreational facilities and retail businesses were introduced. Much of Quebec remained at the ""red"" alert level in November, leading to the ongoing closure of indoor dining and many recreational and cultural facilities. Highlights Employment growth continues to slow Employment rose by 0.3% in November, following an increase of 0.5% in October. From May to September, employment grew by an average of 2.7% per month. Full-time employment rose by 99,000 in November, while part-time work was little changed. Among those who worked at least half of their usual hours, 4.6 million worked from home in November. Growth in self-employment stalled in November and compared to public sector and private sector employees, employment in this group remained furthest from the February pre-COVID level (-4.7%; -136,000). Total hours worked rose by 1.2% in November. Since May, total hours worked has recovered steadily as the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown has given way to more limited and targeted public health measures. Unemployment rate continues to fall from May peak The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 8.5% in November, continuing the steady fall from the record high 13.7% in May. Approximately 317,000 Canadians who were unemployed in October exited the labour force in November. A higher number (372,000) transitioned from unemployment to employment. The number of people who were on temporary layoff, or who had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future, stood at 253,000, a drop of 78.9% from April. Following increases of 79,000 (+36.2%) in September and 151,000 (+50.7%) in October, long-term unemployment held steady in November. A total of 443,000 Canadians, or one-quarter (25.6%) of all the unemployed, had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more. After surging after the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, from 11.2% in February to 36.1% in April, the labour underutilization rate has fallen every month since May, including a 0.3 percentage point drop to 16.9% in November. Varying labour market conditions across provinces and industries Employment increased in six provinces: Ontario, British Columbia and in all four Atlantic provinces. Manitoba experienced its first employment loss since April, while the number of people with a job or business held steady in Quebec, Saskatchewan and Alberta. By November, employment in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had returned to pre-COVID levels. Following little change in October, employment growth resumed in the goods-producing sector (+44,000; +1.2%) in November, with most of the increase in construction. For the first time since the recovery began in May, employment in the services-producing sector was little changed. Employment in information, culture and recreation declined by 26,000 (-3.5%), the first notable decline for this industry since April. Employment in accommodation and food services declined for the second consecutive month, falling by 24,000 (-2.4%) in November. Employment in construction rose by 26,000 (+1.9%), the first increase since July. After pausing in October, employment growth resumed in transportation and warehousing (+20,000; +2.1%). In natural resources, employment rose for the second consecutive month, increasing 3.1% (+10,000) and returning to its pre-COVID level. Employment growth also variable among demographic groups Employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) was unchanged in November after six consecutive months of growth. Employment among core-aged men (25 to 54 years old) rose by 23,000 (+0.4%). Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 rose 0.9% (+20,000), while the youth unemployment rate fell 1.4 percentage points to 17.4%. Employment increased among young men and was little changed for young women. Employment among workers aged 55 and older increased by 23,000 (+0.6%) in November after holding steady in October. Employment among Indigenous people living off-reserve was little changed from October. Among Canadians aged 15 to 69, the unemployment rate of those designated as a visible minority decreased 1.5 percentage points to 10.2% in November. About half of the decline in unemployment among those designated as visible minorities was accounted for by South Asian Canadians (not seasonally adjusted). Employment growth continues to slow Employment rose by 62,000 (+0.3%) in November, following an increase of 84,000 (+0.5%) in October. From May to September, employment grew by an average of 2.7% per month. The unemployment rate was 8.5% in November, down 0.4 percentage points from a month earlier. Employment growth continued to vary across industries in November. Employment fell in industries most directly affected by public health restrictions, notably in accommodation and food services. On the other hand, employment continued to approach or exceed pre-COVID levels in industries where working from home or physical distancing is more feasible, such as professional, scientific and technical services. By April, the initial widespread COVID-19 economic shutdown had directly affected 5.5 million Canadian workers, including 3.0 million who had lost employment and 2.5 million who remained employed but had experienced COVID-related absences from work. By November, the equivalent figure was 1.0 million, including a 574,000 (-3.0%) drop in employment since February and a 448,000 (+55.5%) increase since February in Canadians who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours. Chart 1 Pace of employment recovery slows Gains in full-time work Full-time employment rose by 99,000 (+0.7%) in November, while part-time work was little changed. Compared with pre-COVID February levels, full-time employment was down 2.9%, compared with a decrease of 3.3% for part-time work. Among those who worked part time in November, more than one-fifth (22.6%; 808,000) wanted full-time work (30 hours or more per week) but were unable to find it. This was up 5.2 percentage points from 12 months earlier, with above-average increases among men aged 25 to 54 (up 13.2 percentage points to 46.4%) (not seasonally adjusted). Number of Canadians working from home increases for the second consecutive month Among those who worked at least half of their usual hours, 4.6 million Canadians worked from home in November. This was an increase of approximately 250,000 from October and included 2.5 million who do not usually work from home. Among the same group, the number of people working at locations other than home fell by approximately 100,000 to 12.2 million. Hospitals and schools drive growth in public sector employment The number of public sector employees grew by 32,000 (+0.8%) in November and exceeded its pre-COVID February level by 1.5%. On a year-over-year basis, the number of public sector workers was up 61,000 (+1.6%), driven mostly by increases in hospitals and elementary and secondary schools (not seasonally adjusted). The number of private sector employees was little changed in November, but was down by 411,000 (-3.3%) compared with 12 months earlier. This decline was largest in accommodation and food services, while employment in professional, scientific and technical services increased. Growth in self-employment stalled in November and this group remained furthest from November 2019 (-4.5%; -131,000) and from the February pre-COVID level (-4.7%; -136,000). Chart 2 Increased employment in hospitals and schools drives public sector employment over pre-COVID level Total hours worked continue to grow Along with employment, total hours worked across all industries is a core indicator of the state of the labour market. In general, total hours worked can be influenced by a number of factors such as employment growth, compositional change in employment by industry and occupation, and changes in absences from work. From February to April, employment losses and COVID-related absences from work contributed to a drop of more than one-quarter (-27.7%) in the total number of hours worked across all industries. Since May, total hours worked has recovered steadily as the initial widespread COVID-19 economic shutdown has given way to more limited and targeted public health measures. From October to November, total hours worked rose by 1.2%, continuing the recent trend. Despite this increase in the month, total hours worked was 5.0% lower than in February, with about one-quarter (27.1%) of the net deficit being in accommodation and food services. Construction, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale and retail trade also contributed notably to the February-to-November decline. Unemployment rate continues to fall from May peak The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 8.5% in November, continuing the steady fall from the record high 13.7% in May. The unemployment rate in February was 5.6%, just prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown. The total number of unemployed fell 4.5% to 1.7 million November (-82,000), also continuing the downward trend from the May peak. Approximately 317,000 Canadians who were unemployed in October exited the labour force in November. A higher number (372,000) transitioned from unemployment to employment. Chart 3 Unemployment rate continues to drop from May's record high Unemployment rate among visible minorities falls in November Among Canadians aged 15 to 69, the unemployment rate of those designated as a visible minority decreased 1.5 percentage points to 10.2% in November (not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the unemployment rate among those who are not Indigenous and not a member of a group designated as a visible minority increased by 0.2 percentage points to 6.9% (not seasonally adjusted). About half of the decline in unemployment among those designated as visible minorities was accounted for by South Asian Canadians, whose unemployment rate fell by 3.3 percentage points to 10.5%. At the same time, there were employment gains among South Asian Canadians, with the vast majority (87%) of the increase in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, and more than half (57.9%) in sales and service occupations (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate also fell in November among Southeast Asian Canadians (-3.8 percentage points to 8.7%), while there was little change among the other five largest groups designated as visible minorities (not seasonally adjusted). Temporary layoffs remain high in some industries The spike in unemployment resulting from the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown was driven partly by an unprecedented increase in the number of people on temporary layoff. This number peaked at 1.2 million in April, before falling steadily over the summer and early fall as public health measures were eased. In November, the number of people who were on temporary layoff, or who had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future, stood at 253,000, a drop of 78.9% from April. About one-quarter (26.6%) of people on temporary layoff in November last worked in the accommodation and food services industry (not seasonally adjusted), reflecting the continuing challenges faced by this sector in adjusting to new and continuing public health measures. The wholesale and retail trade (11.8%) and manufacturing (11.6%) industries also accounted for a sizable share of those on temporary layoff. Across all industries, men in the core working age group of 25 to 54 accounted for almost 3 in 10 (28.0%; 71,000) of those on temporary layoff. Job search strategies shift as a large number of Canadians continue to look for work As the number of people on temporary layoff fell over the summer and early fall, the number of job searchers increased and made up an increasing share of the total unemployed. Despite a drop in the month (-39,000; -2.6%), there were 1.5 million job searchers in November, almost half a million more than in February (+448,000; +43.3%). Nearly one in three job searchers in November (432,000; 29.1%) were men in the core working age group of 25 to 54. The most common occupations of job searchers who had worked in the past 12 months included sales and services occupations (36.6%), and occupations related to trades, transport and equipment operators (19.5%) (not seasonally adjusted). Most of the increase in job searchers from February to November was among those in the core-age group of 25 to 54, with 135,000 (+45.3%) more men and 105,000 (+39.6%) more women looking for work. There were 154,000 (+56.3%) more youth searching for work in November than in February, with the increase split between male and female youth. The large increase in job searchers observed since the summer highlights the importance of the various strategies used by the unemployed to make their way back to employment. In November, close to 8 in 10 job searchers (77.5%) looked at job advertisements, up 11.4 percentage points from 12 months earlier (not seasonally adjusted). The share of those looking for work who used public or private employment agencies fell 2.3 percentage points year over year to 19.0%, while the share who relied on friends or family to find job opportunities increased 6.6 percentage points to 32.4%. Long-term unemployed face increased risk of financial difficulty Following increases of 79,000 (+36.2%) in September and 151,000 (+50.7%) in October, long-term unemployment held steady in November. A total of 443,000 Canadians, or one-quarter (25.6%) of all the unemployed, had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more. Workers who became unemployed as a result of previous economic downturns have experienced a range of long-term consequences, including long-term reduction in earnings. Those who entered into a prolonged period of joblessness in recent months are a direct reflection of the unprecedented job losses which resulted from the COVID-19 economic shutdown of March and April, and may face a unique set of short-term and long-term challenges. In November, more than half (53.3%) of the long-term unemployed lived in a household reporting difficulty meeting necessary expenses (not seasonally adjusted). This was higher than the proportion of those with a shorter jobless spell (41.4%) and noticeably higher than the proportion (19.3%) of those who were employed or not in the labour force (not seasonally adjusted). While core-aged people comprised the greatest share (53.9%) of long-term unemployment in November, their contribution was down 4.7 percentage points compared with 12 months earlier. People aged 55 and older, on the other hand, made up a larger share of the long-term unemployed than a year ago—26.2%, up 5.3 percentage points—suggesting that some older workers may be experiencing particular challenges in returning to employment. Youth accounted for one-fifth (20.0%) of the long-term unemployed, down 0.7 percentage points from 12 months earlier. Labour underutilization continues to fall but remains above pre-COVID level Since March, the labour underutilization rate—which reflects the proportion of people in the potential labour force who are either unemployed, want a job but have not looked for one, or are employed but working less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19—has served as an overall indicator of the impact of COVID-19 on labour market conditions. After surging in the wake of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, from 11.2% in February to 36.1% in April, the labour underutilization rate has fallen every month since May, including a 0.3 percentage point decline to 16.9% in November. In November, job searchers accounted for 42.0% of labour underutilization, while those who wanted a job but didn't look for one and those who were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to start a job in the near future made up 15.4% and 7.1% of the total, respectively. The remaining 35.5% of labour underutilization was the result of those who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours in November. Infographic 1 Labour underutilization remains high as more Canadians search for jobs or work reduced hours Varying labour market conditions across provinces As jurisdictions adjusted public health restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases, labour market conditions varied across Canada during the week of November 8 to 14. Employment increased in six provinces: Ontario, British Columbia and in all four Atlantic provinces. Manitoba experienced its first employment loss since April, while the number of people with a job or business held steady in Quebec, Saskatchewan and Alberta. By November, employment levels in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had returned to pre-COVID levels. Employment was nearest February levels in British Columbia (-1.5%) in November and farthest in Manitoba (-4.8%) and Alberta (-4.9%). For further information on key province-level and industry-level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" Infographic 2 Employment furthest from pre-COVID level in Alberta and Manitoba Employment growth continues to slow in Central Canada Following average monthly employment growth of 3.1% from June to September, Ontario saw a slowing of growth in October. This continued in November, as employment rose by 37,000 (+0.5%), mostly in full-time work. Employment in the Toronto CMA was at a standstill in November after increasing for five consecutive months. The Ontario unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 9.1%. The largest employment gain was in construction, an industry not affected by recent restrictions, while there were declines in accommodation and food services amid the tightening of public health measures in the City of Toronto and Region of Peel. Employment in Quebec was little changed for the second consecutive month. In the Montréal CMA, employment was flat for the second consecutive month following average monthly growth of 3.8% from May to September. The Quebec unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 7.2% as fewer people were on temporary layoff. Employment fell in accommodation and food services and information, culture and recreation, coinciding with the targeted public health measures in place since October. Employment increased in professional, scientific and technical services. Continued employment growth in British Columbia Just prior to the start of LFS reference week of November 8 to 14, the Vancouver Coastal Health Region and the Fraser Health Region introduced new restrictions on social gatherings, travel, and gyms and indoor sports facilities, as well as new COVID-related workplace safety requirements. Despite these new restrictions, employment in British Columbia grew by 24,000 (+1.0%) in November, adding to the gains over the previous six months (+335,000). Gains in full-time work were partly offset by losses in part-time employment. Several industries saw increases, including accommodation and food services, transportation and warehousing, wholesale and retail trade, and construction. The unemployment rate fell 0.9 percentage points to 7.1%. Employment grew (+1.2%) in the Vancouver CMA, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous two months. More people working in Atlantic Canada Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick all had employment gains in November. Nova Scotia posted the largest employment increase among the Atlantic provinces, up 10,000 (+2.2%), continuing the upward trend since April. The increase in November was mostly in full-time work. The unemployment rate fell 2.3 percentage points to 6.4%, the lowest since March 2019 and the lowest among the provinces. New Brunswick posted its first significant employment gain (+4,200; +1.2%) since the substantial increases in May and June. The increase in November was nearly all in full-time work and the unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 9.6%. Employment in Newfoundland and Labrador rose for the seventh consecutive month, up 2,300 (+1.0%) in November, and regained all of the losses sustained since February. The unemployment rate in November was little changed at 12.2%. Industries with employment losses at the start of the pandemic such as natural resources, construction and manufacturing saw small increases in subsequent months and offset the declines in March and April. Others, such as healthcare and social assistance and public administration continued to gain employment in recent months, pushing their employment above February levels. Prince Edward Island also had more people working in November (+1,000; +1.3%) and the unemployment rate was 10.2%. Employment losses in Manitoba Employment in Manitoba decreased by 18,000 in November, nearly all in part-time work. This was the first notable decline since April and coincided with tighter public health measures introduced in early November for the Winnipeg metropolitan region and for the rest of the province by the time of the LFS reference week. The largest employment decrease was in accommodation and food services. The unemployment rate was little changed in November at 7.4% as fewer Manitobans participated in the labour market. In both Saskatchewan and Alberta, there was little employment change in November. As of the LFS reference week of November 8 to November 14, both provinces had largely avoided introducing tighter public health measures. The unemployment rate in Saskatchewan increased 0.5 percentage points to 6.9%, with more people looking for work, while the Alberta unemployment rate was little changed at 11.1%. Employment growth continues to vary across industries Following little change in October, employment growth resumed in the goods-producing sector (+44,000; +1.2%) in November, with most of the increase in construction. For the first time since the recovery began in May, employment in the services-producing sector was little changed in November. Employment fell in two industries—information, culture and recreation; and accommodation and food services—as these industries continued to face the headwinds of new and continuing public health measures. These losses were offset by gains in industries less directly affected by the restrictions in place as of the LFS reference week, including retail trade; transportation and warehousing; and finance, insurance, real estate and rental and leasing. Employment declines in information, culture and recreation and accommodation and food services In November, employment in information, culture and recreation declined by 26,000 (-3.5%), the first notable decline for this industry since April. Employment fell for a second consecutive month in Quebec, where restrictions on public gatherings had been notably tightened as of the LFS reference week. At the national level, employment in information, culture and recreation was 10.5% lower in November than in February. Chart 4 Declines in information, culture and recreation and in accommodation and food services dampen overall employment increase Employment in accommodation and food services declined for the second consecutive month, falling by 24,000 (-2.4%) in November, with the drop being shared between Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec. Nearly 1 in 10 (8.9%) employees in accommodation and food services worked less than half their usual hours in November—the third highest share among all industries, following business, building and other support services (10.3%), and transportation and warehousing (9.2%) (not seasonally adjusted). Infographic 3 Employment furthest from recovery in accommodation and food services In the face of new and continuing public health measures to control the spread of COVID-19, employers in accommodation and food services are likely to continue to face a number of challenges. From mid-September to late October, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions to collect information on businesses' expectations moving forward. Almost one-quarter of businesses in accommodation and food services (22.5%) expected to reduce their number of employees over the next three months, more than double the average across all businesses (10.4%). Second consecutive employment increase in retail trade In retail trade, employment grew for the second consecutive month, rising 1.5% in November (+32,000), with most of the month-over-month increase in Ontario. Shutdowns of in-person shopping at non-essential retailers were introduced in Toronto and Peel on November 23, after the LFS reference week, and may be reflected in the December LFS results. December results may also shed light on the effect of tighter restrictions in other provinces such as Manitoba and Alberta. At the national level, the employment increase in November brought retail trade to within 3.7% of its pre-COVID employment level. Employment growth resumes for construction and transportation and warehousing Employment in construction rose by 26,000 (+1.9%) in November, the first increase since July, largely due to a 5.5% (+28,000) increase in Ontario. Nationally, employment in construction was 5.7% below its February level. After pausing in October, employment growth resumed in transportation and warehousing in November (+20,000; +2.1%). The increase was largely the result of gains in Ontario and British Columbia, bringing employment in this industry to within 6.4% of its pre-COVID level. Finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing now exceeding pre-COVID employment levels Employment rose for the third consecutive month in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing, up by 15,000 (+1.2%). The recent employment growth in this industry pushed it fully into recovery territory, surpassing its February level by 2.3%. Employment up in natural resources for the second consecutive month In natural resources, employment rose for the second consecutive month, rising 3.1% in November (+10,000) and returning to its pre-COVID level. The month-over-month gain was nearly equally split between Alberta and British Columbia. Data for this industry over the next few months may shed light on the impact of Alberta ending its limits on oil production in December, allowing producers to utilize available pipeline capacity and increase employment. Employment growth stalls for core-aged women Total employment among core-aged women (25 to 54 years old) was unchanged in November after six consecutive months of growth. Gains in full-time work (+49,000; +1.0%) were offset by losses in part-time employment (-52,000; -5.0%).Despite this lack of growth in the month, employment was closer to its pre-COVID February level among core-aged women (-1.5%) than among all other major demographic groups. Year-over-year declines in employment by industry—which account for typical seasonal variations—were greatest in accommodation and food services; business, building and other support services; and other services. These declines were partially offset by year-over-year gains in the finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing industry, and in educational services (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate for core-aged women was little changed in November at 6.8%, up 2.2 percentage points compared with February. After returning to its pre-COVID level in September, the participation rate for women in the core age group remained stable at 83.8% in November, well above the recent low of 77.8% in April. Core-aged men see gains in part-time work Employment among core-aged men (aged 25 to 54) rose by 23,000 (+0.4%) in November, driven entirely by an increase in part-time employment and bringing employment for this demographic group to within 1.7% of its pre-COVID level. On a year-over-year basis, the majority of the employment declines among core-aged men occurred in construction, accommodation and food services, and transportation and warehousing. The unemployment rate for core-aged men was 7.3% in November, down 0.3 percentage points from October but still higher than the pre-pandemic rate of 4.8% in February. After returning to pre-COVID levels in September, the labour force participation rate for core-aged men was unchanged from October at 91.6%. Mothers continue to experience COVID-related losses in hours, despite employment returning to pre-shutdown levels As children returned to school in August and September, attention focused on how parents were adapting to balancing work and childcare responsibilities with new school routines, whether online learning at home or returning to the classroom. Fully understanding these impacts requires a range of labour indicators available from the LFS—particularly employment and absences from work—as well as non-labour indicators from other sources. In September, employment returned to pre-pandemic levels among both core-aged mothers and core-aged fathers of children less than 18 years old. This situation continued in November, with little year-over-year employment change in either group. Patterns in absences from work, however, indicate that mothers may be experiencing different challenges than fathers, particularly among parents whose youngest child was under 13 years of age. On a year-over-year basis, there were 54.9% more mothers in this group working less than half their usual hours in November, compared with 41.3% more fathers (not seasonally adjusted). These absences include those related to personal circumstances, such as caring for children, as well as those related to job situation, such as reduced shifts. In the November LFS, respondents were asked whether they had any concerns related to caring for children or other family members in the context of the ongoing pandemic. The specific nature and impact of these concerns may vary based on each family's particular childcare, schooling, and employment situation. Among core-aged parents whose youngest child was under 13 years of age, the share citing caregiving concerns was higher among job searchers (41.7%) than among those who were employed (32.9%). Mothers (35.3%) were somewhat more likely than fathers (30.0%) to cite concerns related to caregiving. Employment farther from pre-COVID level for female youth than male counterparts Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 rose 0.9% (+20,000) in November, while the youth unemployment rate fell 1.4 percentage points to 17.4%. Fewer youth aged 15 to 24 were in the labour force in November, as the participation rate fell 0.6 percentage points to 63.6%, with the decrease entirely among young women (-1.2 percentage points). The share of youth attending school was up 1.8 percentage points (from 62.1% to 63.9%) compared with 12 months earlier (not seasonally adjusted). Employment increased among young men (+14,000; +1.2%) in November, with gains in full-time employment (+34,000; +5.1%) only partly offset by losses in part-time work (-19,000; -3.8%). Among female youth, in contrast, employment was little changed in the month. The labour market impact of COVID-19 has been particularly challenging for young women, who experienced greater initial COVID-related employment losses in March and April. As of November, employment for this group remained farther (-11.0%) from pre-pandemic February levels than that of all other major demographic groups. Similarly, while the unemployment rate of young men (18.2%) remained higher than for all the major demographic groups in November, the year-over-year increase in the unemployment rate was higher for young women (+6.6 percentage points) than young men (+5.1 percentage points). Chart 5 Employment farther from pre-COVID level for female youth than male counterparts On a year-over-year basis, youth employment was down by one-third (-33.0%) in information, culture and recreation, and by one-quarter (-25.8%) in accommodation and food services in November (not seasonally adjusted). Year-over-year losses in these two industries, which typically account for about one-quarter of youth employment (25.4% in 2019), were partially offset by a gain in the construction industry, where employment was up on a year-over-year basis. Chart 6 Youth unemployment rates remain high in November Employment increases for Canadians aged 55 and older Employment among workers aged 55 and older increased by 23,000 (+0.6%) in November after holding steady in October. Gains were primarily among older women, with employment little changed for men in this age group. Nevertheless, employment for older workers remained 3.2% below February levels, with employment for older men (-2.5%) closer to pre-pandemic levels than for older women (-4.1%). By industry, the largest year-over-year employment declines for older men were among those who worked in retail trade and construction. For women, losses were most notable in healthcare and social assistance, and the other services industry (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate for workers aged 55 and older decreased by 0.8 percentage points to 7.1% in November. Employment rate among very recent immigrants remains closest to February levels In November, the employment rate of immigrants who landed in Canada more than five years ago (58.1%) was 1.2 percentage points below its pre-COVID February level, closer than the rate for those born in Canada (59.7%), which was down 1.7 percentage points (not seasonally adjusted). For more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant employment, see Transitions into and out of employment by immigrants during the COVID-19 lockdown and recovery. The employment rate of very recent immigrants—those who landed in Canada in the past five years—was 65.6% in November, little changed from its pre-COVID February level (not seasonally adjusted). The labour market situation of this group has been impacted by COVID-related restrictions on international travel, which have led to a sudden reduction in new immigrants to Canada. For more information on recent changes in international migration resulting from COVID-19 public health measures, see Canada's population estimates: Age and sex, July 1, 2020. Employment recovery stalls for Indigenous people Employment among Indigenous people living off-reserve was little changed from October. Employment for Indigenous people remained further from February levels (-5.5%) than non-Indigenous Canadians (-1.6%). For more information, see Labour market impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous people: March to August 2020. Looking ahead As the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic enters a new phase—with COVID-19 caseloads increasing and the holiday season approaching—Statistics Canada remains committed to informing Canadians on the wide range of labour market challenges, faced by employers, workers and families.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for November are for the week of November 8 to 14. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. Since March 2020, all face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both interviewers and respondents. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. As has been the case each month since June, approximately 40,000 interviews were completed in November. The distribution of LFS interviews in November 2020 compared with October 2020, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • October 2020: 67.8% • November 2020: 67.5% Online interviews • October 2020: 32.2% • November 2020: 32.5% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in November 2020 analysis To continue capturing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the supplementary indicators used in March and April were slightly adapted. Therefore, the May to November supplementary indicators are not directly comparable to the supplementary indicators published in April and March 2020. Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Time-related underemployment rate combines people who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours as a proportion of all employed people. Information on population groups Beginning in July, the LFS includes a question asking respondents to report the population groups to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2016 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other For LFS records interviewed before July, population group characteristics were assigned using an experimental sample matching data integration method, which involves LFS and the Census of Population This historical data complements population group data collected directly in LFS, through a comparison of year-over-year changes in the unemployment rate. According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, data for the population who identify as Aboriginals are analyzed separately. The remaining category is described as ""people not designated as visible minorities"" or ""people who are not a visible minority."" Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). To ensure that the LFS reflects current labour market conditions as accurately as possible, data are revised following each census to reflect the most recently available population estimates and to correspond with current Standard Geographic Classification boundaries. This standard revision process results in minor changes to recent and historical LFS data and has little impact on trends in key labour market indicators, such as employment, unemployment, and labour force participation rates. Changes to LFS Common Output Data Repository tables and information products resulting from this historical revision will be announced in The Daily on January 25, 2021. Next release The next release of the LFS will be on January 8, 2021.

Employment Insurance (EI) statistics are now available for the month of October. EI statistics complement information available from other sources—notably the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH)—and contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions in Canada. New indicators, such as the proportion of regular EI beneficiaries who qualified under new rules introduced on September 27, 2020, and the number of beneficiaries by industry, are particularly valuable in understanding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on Canadian workers and employers. October results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of October 11 to 17. By then, several provinces had tightened public health measures in response to increases in COVID-19 cases. Unlike the widespread economic shutdown implemented in March and April, these measures were targeted at businesses where the risk of COVID transmission is greatest, including indoor restaurants, bars and recreational facilities. The release of the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program was suspended from March to September. During this period, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was introduced and the number of EI recipients dropped significantly. EI statistics for this period are also now available. CERB data will be featured in future Statistics Canada analytical and research products. Record number of regular EI beneficiaries in October In October, on a seasonally adjusted basis, 1.4 million Canadians received regular EI benefits, more than triple the number in February (446,000). This was the highest number of EI recipients in Canada since comparable data became available in 1997. In comparison, immediately following the recession of 2008/2009, the number of EI beneficiaries peaked at 822,000 in June 2009. To support Canadians facing the labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, CERB was introduced in March 2020. The number of regular EI beneficiaries increased in March and April, as those with active claims remained in the EI program. It then declined sharply beginning in May, as all new claims were redirected to CERB, and reached a low of 160,000 in August. Results from the LFS indicate there were 1.8 million unemployed in October, including 1.5 million who were looking for work and 300,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Record number of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries in October Changes to the EI program lead to increases in the number of regular EI beneficiaries On September 27, 2020, the Government of Canada introduced temporary changes to the EI program to facilitate the transition of CERB recipients to EI and to increase EI eligibility. These new measures included a reduction in the number of insured hours required to qualify for regular EI benefits. In October, 11.2% of regular EI recipients qualified under these new EI rules and would not have qualified under the previous rules (not seasonally adjusted). The province of Quebec had the highest share of EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new EI rules, at 14.3%, driven by higher proportions in the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Trois-Rivières (20.1%), Saguenay (19.8%) and Québec (18.6%). The most recent results from the LFS indicate that, after five consecutive months of gains, employment in Quebec was little changed in October and November. New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan also had proportions of EI beneficiaries who qualified under new rules which exceeded the national average, while Alberta recorded the lowest proportion (8.1%) of all provinces. The proportion of recipients qualifying under the new EI rules was highest among youth aged 15 to 24 (19.1%). As youth are less likely to be employed full-time, they would previously have been less likely to have the amount of insurable hours required to qualify for EI. According to results from the LFS, employment remained furthest from pre-pandemic levels among youth in October. Chart 1 Percentage of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020, October 2020, not seasonally adjusted Largest increases in EI beneficiaries among census metropolitan areas The number of overall regular EI beneficiaries increased in all provinces from February to October, led by British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. While each of the four Atlantic provinces saw more modest increases in EI beneficiaries over this period, they led all provinces in October in the number of EI beneficiaries as a proportion of the total labour force. Outside of the Atlantic provinces, Alberta had the highest proportion of beneficiaries relative to their labour force, while Manitoba had the lowest. Compared with October 2019, the number of EI beneficiaries in all provinces increased proportionally more in the services-producing sector than in the goods-producing sector (not seasonally adjusted). New EI beneficiary data provide additional insight into differences in the impact of COVID-19 on regional labour markets across Canada. The increase in the number of EI beneficiaries from February to October was proportionally greater in CMAs and census agglomerations (CAs) (+269%; +804,000) than in areas outside of CMAs/CAs (+70.5%; +104,000). As a result, the geographic distribution of beneficiaries within provinces shifted over the same period. Within British Columbia, for example, the CMA of Vancouver accounted for more than one-half of recipients (55.2%) in October, compared with just over one-third (34.7%) in February. Chart 2 Atlantic provinces have highest proportion of regular EI beneficiaries relative to their labour force Women now account for half of all regular EI beneficiaries Prior to the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, women made up a lower proportion (37.3%) of regular EI recipients than men (62.7%) in February. Following cumulative February-to-October increases of 508,000 (+305%), women accounted for 49.8% of regular EI beneficiaries in October, the first time they have accounted for half of beneficiaries since comparable data became available in 1997. From February to October, the number of regular beneficiaries increased by 400,000 (+143%) among men. Results from the LFS indicate that women accounted for a disproportionate share of the job losses at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March. The number of youth aged 15 to 24 receiving regular EI benefits increased by 137,000 from February to October, including increases of 72,000 (+597%) among young women and 64,000 (+226%) among young men. LFS results indicate that, as of October, employment remained farther from pre-COVID February levels among young women (-11.5%) than among all other major demographic groups. The proportion of EI recipients who qualified under the new rules introduced in September 2020 was higher among women (11.8%) than men (10.6%). A similar pattern was observed among youth, with young women being more likely to qualify under the new rules than young men (20.0% versus 18.3%). Chart 3 Women now account for half of regular EI beneficiaries Looking ahead As both workers and industries continue to adapt to the new realities associated with COVID-19 over the coming months, EIS, in combination with the LFS, the SEPH and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, will be an important source of insights on sectoral and economy-wide labour market conditions in Canada. In October, 32.8% of all regular EI beneficiaries last worked in three industries hardest-hit by public health measures, including accommodation and food services (18.3%); retail trade (10.5%); and arts, entertainment and recreation (4.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). Future shifts in the distribution of beneficiaries by industry and occupation will be an indication of the extent to which labour demand has recovered in these industries, as well as the ability of workers from these industries to find their way back to employment. Similarly, in October almost 7 in 10 (67.2%) regular EI beneficiaries had not made a previous paid claim within the last 5 years, compared with just over 4 in 10 (42.2%) at the same period last year, reflecting the widespread labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown. Future changes in this indicator will contribute to an understanding of the ability of Canadian workers to recover from these impacts and avoid future spells of unemployment. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada Recovery Benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)). Concepts and methodology The analysis presented here focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. Claims data pertain to initial and renewal claims received for any type of EI benefits, including special benefits. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. Regular EI benefits are paid to eligible individuals who lose their jobs and who are available for and able to work, but cannot find a job. To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a claim. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits, and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March to October 2020 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Numbers in the Daily text are rounded to the nearest thousand. The number of regular EI beneficiaries and the number of claims received for the current month and the previous month are subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received EI benefits from October 11 to 17. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. However, claims data are for the entire month. New indicators for October 2020 1. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals that only qualified for EI in October 2020 as a result of these program changes. 2. Beneficiaries who have not made a previous paid claim within the last five years The indicator of whether a beneficiary has made a previous paid claim in the past five years is based only on claims for EI. Whether or not the beneficiary received CERB payments between March and September 2020 is not used in the calculation of this indicator. 3. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and Record of Employment (ROE) administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. Geographical definitions A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centered on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – definitions for more information. Data availability A number of CODR data tables published on the Statistics Canada website remain suspended with the release of the October 2020 data. 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337: remain suspended, as of the December 2019 reference period, due to occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is on-going to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007, and 14-10-0008: remain suspended, as of the March 2020 reference period, due to a source data file containing records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. 14-10-0009: for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed due to data quality. Next release Data on EI for November 2020 will be released on January 21, 2021.

Retail sales rose 1.1% to $53.9 billion in September—the fifth consecutive monthly increase since the record decline in April. Core retail sales—which excludes gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—also rose 1.1%, on higher sales at general merchandise stores and food and beverage stores. Retail sales were up in 9 of 11 subsectors, representing 93.2% of retail trade. In volume terms, sales were up 1.1% in September. Rounding out the third quarter, retail sales were up 22.6% compared with the second quarter. In volume terms, retail sales rose 21.5%. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales were relatively unchanged in October. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 50% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 88.5%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in September Core retail sales rise on higher sales at general merchandise and food and beverage stores Core retail sales rose at almost three times the pace (+1.1%) in September compared with August (+0.4%), led by the first increase at general merchandise stores (+1.8%) in three months. Sales at food and beverage stores (+0.9%) rose for the second consecutive month, partially due to higher prices for meat, fish and dairy products. Retail sales bounced back at furniture and home furnishings stores (+4.5%) following a 2.0% decrease in August. Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased for the fifth consecutive month, up 1.5% in September (seasonally adjusted) and 1.7% above February levels. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, new motor vehicle sales were up 2.5% year over year in dollar terms in September. Sales of trucks, an aggregate group which includes light trucks, heavy trucks and buses, increased 5.7% year over year, while passenger car sales declined 12.5%. New motor vehicle sales exceeded the pre-pandemic level (February 2020) by over one-third (+36.9%) in September. Sales at gasoline stations (+0.2%) rose for the fifth consecutive month in September. In volume terms, sales were up 0.6%. Chart 2 Sales up in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales up in eight provinces In Ontario, sales rose 1.0% with general merchandise stores leading the growth. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, sales increased 1.2%. In Alberta, retail sales were up 2.5% in September, led by higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers also drove the sales growth in British Columbia (+1.7%). In the CMA of Vancouver, sales rose 0.9%. Sales in Quebec rose for the fifth consecutive month, edging up 0.2% in September. In the CMA of Montréal, sales were up 0.4%. Retail e-commerce sales in Canada up by three-quarters year over year On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached $3.2 billion in September, accounting for 5.6% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales rose 0.5 percentage points from August—despite more retailers expanding in-person shopping in accordance with public health measures—and was up 2.1 percentage points year over year. Retail e-commerce sales were up 74.3% year over year in September, while total unadjusted retail sales increased 9.3%. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce rose 8.1%. Chart 3 Retail e-commerce increases in September Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advanced estimate for retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are the exact same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruptions. For information regarding cannabis statistics, consult the Cannabis Stats Hub. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type do not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 45411—Electronic Shopping and Mail Order Houses. The second type have a storefront and are commonly referred to as brick-and-mortar retailers. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they too are classified to NAICS 45411. Some common electronic commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current dollar values using consumer price indexes. Real-time tables Real-time tables 20-10-0054-01 and 20-10-0079-01 will be updated soon. Next release Data on retail trade for October will be released on December 18.

Year over year, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose at a faster pace in November (+1.0%) than in October (+0.7%), with shelter prices (+1.9%) contributing the most to the all-items increase. Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 1.3% in November, up from a 1.0% increase in October. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.3% in November.

This interactive calculator allows you to enter dollar amounts in the common expense categories to produce a personalized inflation rate, which you can compare to the official measure of inflation that represents the average Canadian household—the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Visit the Consumer Price Index portal to find all CPI data, publications, interactive tools, and announcements highlighting new products and upcoming changes to the CPI in one convenient location. Check out the Consumer Price Index Data Visualization Tool to access current and historical CPI data in a customizable visual format. Chart 1 The 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding gasoline Highlights Prices rose in six of the eight major components on a year-over-year basis in November. Chart 2 Prices rise in six of eight major components Although consumer confidence remains below pre-pandemic levels, increased consumer spending on household durable goods supported higher prices for furniture (+2.8%) and household appliances (+2.9%), which remain above pre-pandemic levels. As the household savings rate declined compared with the early months of the pandemic, physical distancing rules encouraging Canadians to stay home may have prompted increased spending on big-ticket items for the home. Rent prices rise year over year Rent prices rose 1.5% in the 12 months to November, up from a 1.0% increase in October. While year-over-year growth in rent prices remained below pre-pandemic levels, November marked the fifth month-over-month increase in six months, with the lone decrease occurring in July. Homeowners' replacement cost rises, while mortgage interest cost falls The homeowners' replacement cost index, which is linked to the price of new homes, rose 1.1% month over month in November, the ninth consecutive monthly increase. Historically low interest rates coupled with a shift in home buyer preferences toward larger spaces continued to fuel demand for single-family homes. This higher demand and the combination of higher building material costs and low inventory of homes for sale in some markets contributed to rising prices for new housing. The mortgage interest cost index fell 0.9% on a month-over-month basis in November, following a 0.7% decline in October, which marked the seventh consecutive monthly decline and the largest decrease since February 1994. Lower interest rates following reductions to the Bank of Canada's policy interest rate in March continued to contribute to the decline in borrowing costs as more Canadians renewed mortgages at lower rates. Chart 3 Monthly changes in mortgage interest cost and homeowners' replacement cost diverge Gasoline prices remain low Gasoline prices fell 11.9% year over year in November, with domestic and international demand remaining low. The tightening of public health restrictions in response to the second wave of COVID-19 continued to weigh on low global demand for gasoline. Travel tours and COVID-19 As a result of international travel advisories, travel tours remained unavailable to consumers in November. A general imputation strategy for services not available to consumers resulted in prices for travel tours being replaced with an imputed movement from the all-items CPI. As a result of this treatment, the travel tours index, which is highly seasonal in nature, is up 18.0% compared with November 2019, when prices fell 11.0%. This seasonal decline, which typically follows a price increase related to travel during Thanksgiving and the fall reading week, was not observed in 2020 due to the unavailability of international travel tours, resulting in upward pressure on the index. As such, the interpretation of the 12-month price change indicator should be made with caution. Regional highlights Prices increased in eight provinces on a year-over-year basis in November. Gasoline prices in British Columbia fell less, on a year-over-year basis, in November (-12.3%) than in October (-18.0%). A price drop in November 2019, resulting from a surplus of fuel in the Pacific Northwest, no longer impacted the 12-month movement in November 2020. In contrast, consumer prices were down in New Brunswick (-0.4%) and Prince Edward Island (-0.5%), where furnace fuel oil is more commonly used. At the national level, prices for fuel oil and other fuels (-23.3%) were almost one-quarter lower this November than in November 2019. Chart 4 The Consumer Price Index increases in eight provinces Higher natural gas prices in Manitoba Manitobans paid just over one-quarter more for natural gas (+26.7%) in November compared with the same month a year earlier. The increase primarily reflected the removal of temporary rate adjustments introduced in the province in November 2019. On a month-over-month basis, natural gas prices rose 17.5% in November compared with a decline of 20.7% in November 2019 when this subsidy was introduced.

Goods and services in the CPI which were not available to consumers in November due to COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, effectively removing their impact on the monthly CPI. The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the All-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. Due to new restrictions, the price indexes for beer served in licensed establishments, wine served in licensed establishments and liquor served in licensed establishments were imputed in Quebec, using the indexes to which consumers likely redirected their expenditures: beer purchased from stores, wine purchased from stores and liquor purchased from stores. Consistent with previous months affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for suspended flights are excluded from the November CPI calculation because passengers were ultimately unable to consume them. As a result, select sub-components of the air transportation index were imputed from the parent index (air transportation). A document entitled Technical Supplement for the November 2020 Consumer Price Index is available in the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M) publication, with further details on the imputations used to compile the November 2020 CPI. Inter-city data tables With this release, data on inter-city indexes of price differentials of consumer goods and services, appearing in data table 18-10-0003-01, have been updated to October 2019. This table includes spatial indexes that measure the price differentials across geographical locations (15 Canadian cities) at a given period of time known as the reference period. A document entitled Inter-city indexes of price differentials, of consumer goods and services provides further information on methodology. This program is currently under review, which may impact the timing of the next release.

Household saving rate 14.6% Third quarter 2020 Source(s): Table 36-10-0112-01. Household disposable income Third quarter 2020 -3.1% (quarterly change) Source(s): Table 36-10-0112-01. Terms of trade 94.0 (2012=100) Third quarter 2020 Source(s): Table 36-10-0105-01. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 8.9% in the third quarter, following an 11.3% drop in the second quarter and a 1.9% decline in the first. Despite strong growth in the third quarter—the steepest since quarterly data were first recorded in 1961—real GDP was down 5.3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Final domestic demand rose 10.8%, after an 11.4% decline in the second quarter and a 1.6% drop in the first quarter. Chart 1 Gross domestic product and final domestic demand The increase in GDP in the third quarter reflected reopening of the economy, with substantial upturns in housing investment, household spending on durable goods, and exports. These upturns were influenced by favourable mortgage rates, governments' continued support to households and businesses affected by the pandemic, and growth in major trading partners' economies in the third quarter. Chart 2 Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product, third quarter of 2020 Businesses drew down $33.1 billion of inventories; consequently, the economy-wide stock-to-sales ratio fell from 0.987 in the second quarter to 0.845 in the third quarter—the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2018. Household spending rebounds Household spending rebounded 13.0%, after a 13.6% drop in the second quarter and a 2.6% decline in the first. Nevertheless, household spending was down 5.0% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Chart 3 Household final consumption of durable goods and non-durable goods Outlays for durable goods rose 38.0%, the steepest on record. Increases in spending on durable goods were driven by purchases of new trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles (+73.8%), used motor vehicles (+50.5%), and new passenger cars (+59.8%), reflecting pent-up demand. Spending on durable goods was up 7.7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Outlays for non-durable goods rose 4.4%, after falling 3.9% in the second quarter. The rise in outlays for services (+9.6%) was led by food and beverage services (+52.4%), aided by the popularity of outdoor patios. Despite growth in the quarter, household spending on services was 12.4% lower, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Record rise in housing investment Housing investment rose 30.2%, after declining 15.0% in the second quarter. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, housing investment was up 10.3%. Chart 4 Housing investment The upturn was led by ownership transfer costs (+109.5%) and, to a lesser extent, renovations (+17.7%). The increase in ownership transfer costs was widespread, as home resale activities resumed across the country, with sharp increases in resale units and prices. New construction increased 9.7%, after a 7.6% decline in the second quarter. The increases coincided with low mortgage rates, improved job market conditions, and higher compensation of employees in the third quarter. Business investment grows Business investments in non-residential buildings, machinery and equipment and intellectual property products all rebounded, but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Investments in engineering structures (-4.8%) continued to decline. Export and import volumes rebound Export volumes rose 14.5%, after falling 18.9% in the second quarter; however, export volumes were down 8.7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The rise in exports reflected higher domestic production and increased international demand as the economies of major trading partners—notably, the United States (+7.4%), the United Kingdom (+15.5%), Germany (+8.2%), Italy (+16.1%) and France (+18.2%)—grew. Exports of motor vehicles and parts rose sharply (+162.3%), reflecting a resurgence in demand. Chart 5 Exports and imports A substantial increase in import volumes (+20.9%) was led by motor vehicles and parts (+192.1%), communication, and audio and video equipment (+58.5%), industrial machinery and equipment (+18.7%) and cleaning products, appliances, and miscellaneous goods and supplies (+33.1%). Despite these increases, import volumes were down 9.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The ratio of the price of exports to the price of imports—the terms-of-trade—rose 6.2% in the third quarter of 2020, primarily because of a 99.6% increase in prices of exported crude oil and crude bitumen. Nominal GDP rises The GDP implicit price index, which reflects the overall price of domestically produced goods and services, rose 2.6% in the third quarter. Consequently, growth in nominal GDP (+11.6%) was higher than that of real GDP. However, nominal GDP was down 4.6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Compensation of employees increased 7.9%, after declining 8.7% in the second quarter. Government wage support programs represented 5.5% of compensation of employees in the third quarter, compared with 10.4% in the second quarter. These programs include the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Temporary Wage Subsidy; the latter ended in June 2020, but the former continues. The gross operating surplus for non-financial (+15.7%) and financial (+3.0%) corporations rose. These gains stemmed largely from reopening of businesses such as malls, restaurants, and hair salons. Household savings rate remains elevated Household disposable income dropped 3.1%, mainly owing to a 24.3% decline in other benefits in the third quarter. Canadians relied less on income support programs, as many resumed employment. Government transfers in the form of employment insurance benefits fell by nearly 50%, reflecting the decline in the unemployment rate over the quarter. The increase in compensation, coupled with still-elevated government transfers, helped offset a rebound in consumption as Canadians recorded another quarter of strong saving. The savings rate stood at 14.6%, down from a record 27.5% in the second quarter, but significantly higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, at 2.0%. Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic With the relaxation of constraints that had been imposed on economic activities to curtail the pandemic early in the year, the Canadian economy rose sharply in the third quarter. Despite strong growth in the quarter, real GDP was well below that in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the recent imposition of new lockdowns, full recovery may take longer than the trend in the third quarter suggests.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Data on gross domestic product, income and expenditure are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Revisions to gross domestic product This release incorporates the 2017 benchmark supply and use tables and reflects the integration of updates to exports, imports and final household spending on travel services. As a result, Canada's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was revised down from 3.17% to 3.04% for 2017, and revised up from 2.01% to 2.43% for 2018, and from 1.66% to 1.86% for 2019. Percentage changes for expenditure-based statistics (such as household spending, investment, and exports) are calculated from volume measures that are adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-based statistics (such as compensation of employees and operating surplus) are calculated from nominal values; that is, they are not adjusted for price variations. Unless otherwise stated, growth rates represent the percentage change in the series from one quarter to the next; for instance, from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020. Support measures by governments To alleviate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented a number of programs, including Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and Canada Emergency Response Benefit. For a comprehensive explanation of how government support measures were treated in compilation of the estimates, see the report ""Recording COVID-19 measures in the national accounts."" Details of some of the more significant government measures can be found in the footnotes of tables: 36-10-0103-01, 36-10-0112-01, 36-10-0115-01, 36-10-0118-01, and 36-10-0477-01.

Unfilled orders $90.0 billion October 2020 -2.3% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 16-10-0047-01. Manufacturing sales rose 0.3% to $54.1 billion in October, following a 2.2% increase in September. The increase in October was almost entirely attributable to non-durable industries, led by the paper, and petroleum and coal industries. Year over year, sales were down 5.2%. Manufacturing sales in constant dollars were unchanged, indicating that the increase in October was driven entirely by higher prices. Chart 1 Manufacturing sales Non-durable goods industries lead the growth Paper manufacturing sales rose 5.4% to $2.4 billion in October, the second consecutive monthly increase, on higher sales in the pulp, paper and paperboard mills industries. The increase was attributable to higher prices and demand, and led to a 2.8 percentage point gain in the capacity utilization rate for the industry. Sales in constant dollars were up 5.3%. Sales in current dollars of paper products in October stood 5.1% above February and were up 5.6% year over year. In the petroleum and coal product industry, sales increased 3.1% to $3.9 billion in October, following a 0.2% decrease in September. Higher prices were responsible for the increase in October as sales in constant dollars fell 0.9%. Excluding September, sales in the industry have been trending upward since April, when sales fell by nearly half (-46.8%) on sharply lower prices and demand due to the pandemic-related shutdown. Petroleum and coal manufacturing sales in October were almost one-third (-29.4%) below pre-pandemic levels in February and were down 39.0% year over year. Motor vehicle sales rose 1.9% to $4.6 billion in October, following a 2.8% decline in September. Despite the increase, sales were 3.8% below the pre-pandemic level in February and were down 11.7% year over year. In October, motor vehicle inventories were at their lowest level since January 2018 and contributed to the slow recovery in motor vehicle sales. Sales also rose at primary metal (+2.0%), other transportation equipment (+24.4%) and plastic and rubber product (+2.2%) manufacturers in October. Following two consecutive gains, sales of chemical products fell 2.5% to $4.3 billion in October. The decline was mostly attributable to lower sales of resin, synthetic rubber and artificial and synthetic fibres, and pharmaceuticals and medicine. Production in the aerospace product and parts industry were down 5.9% to $1.6 billion in October, following a 15.3% increase in September. Aerospace manufacturers ramped down production due to the collapse in demand and uncertainty surrounding the length of global travel restrictions during the second wave of COVID-19. Production in the industry was one-quarter (-25.1%) below pre-pandemic levels in February. Exports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts (-9.3%) also declined in October. Sales were also down in the motor vehicle parts (-2.3%) and fabricated metal product (-1.7%) industries in October. Sales up in seven provinces, led by New Brunswick Manufacturing sales rose in seven provinces in October, led by New Brunswick and British Columbia. Quebec posted the largest decline, followed by Newfoundland and Labrador. Following a 10.9% increase in September, sales in New Brunswick rose 7.2% to $1.4 billion in October, on higher sales of non-durable goods. However, year-over-year sales were down by almost one-third (-30.4%). Sales in British Columbia increased 1.5% to $4.7 billion in October, the sixth consecutive monthly gain. Higher sales of paper (+22.0%) and wood (+3.8%) products were primarily responsible for the monthly increase. Sales were up 8.8% in October compared with February and up 8.8% year over year. Sales in Quebec were down 0.7% to $13.2 billion, following five consecutive monthly gains, mostly attributable to lower production in the aerospace industry. Sales in Newfoundland and Labrador declined 21.2% to $242.0 million in October, mostly reflecting lower sales of durable goods. Regina leads the sales growth among selected census metropolitan areas Manufacturing sales on an unadjusted basis were up in 5 of the 12 selected census metropolitan areas in October, led by Regina. Montréal and Toronto posted the largest declines. In Regina, sales rose by almost one-third (+30.8%) to $404.8 million on higher sales of petroleum and coal, transportation equipment and paper products. This followed a 20.3% decline in September. Sales declined 1.0% in Montréal on lower production of aerospace product and parts. In Toronto, sales were down 0.6% on lower production in the aerospace product and parts industry, as well as lower sales in the machinery industry. Inventory levels decrease Following two consecutive monthly gains, total inventories declined 0.4% to $86.5 billion in October. Higher inventories of wood (+3.1%) and plastic and rubber products (+4.1%) were offset by lower inventories in the transportation equipment industry (-2.1%). Total inventory levels in October were 1.3% below their pre-pandemic level in February and were down 1.1% year over year. Chart 2 Inventory levels decline The inventory-to-sales ratio edged down from 1.61 in September to 1.60 in October. This ratio measures the time, in months, that would be required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain at their current level. Chart 3 The inventory-to-sales ratio edges down Unfilled orders decline Unfilled orders were down 2.3% to $90.0 billion in October primarily on lower unfilled orders of aerospace product and parts (-3.2%), due to the cancellation or slowdown in orders. This drop brought total unfilled orders of aerospace product and parts to their lowest level since October 2018. Chart 4 Unfilled orders decrease Following a 4.3% increase in September, total new orders declined 3.9% to $52.0 billion in October. New orders decreased in 12 of 21 industries, mainly attributable to the transportation equipment industry (-19.2%). Capacity utilization rate decreases The capacity utilization rate (not seasonally adjusted) for the total manufacturing sector decreased from 78.4% in September to 77.8% in October. Chart 5 The capacity utilization rate decreases Capacity utilization rates increased in the paper (+2.8 percentage points), primary metal (+1.1 percentage points) and petroleum and coal product (+0.8 percentage points) industries. The capacity utilization rate in the transportation equipment industry was down 4.4 percentage points, mainly on lower production in the aerospace industry. Manufacturing employment edged down 0.2% in October. Advanced preliminary 2019 estimates of the Annual Survey of Manufacturing Industries Delays in collection, adversely affected by shutdowns ordered due to the pandemic, have required the rescheduling of the release of the Annual Survey of Manufacturing Industries 2019 preliminary estimates and 2018 revised estimates to March 15, 2021. To help reduce the impact on our users, we are providing advanced 2019 preliminary estimates for 3 of the 20 published variables: total revenue is estimated at $784.4 billion; revenue from goods manufactured is estimated at $700.9 billion; and total expenses are estimated at $686.0 billion. These advanced preliminary estimates will be revised with the official release of the Annual Survey of Manufacturing Industries. For information on why the Annual Survey of Manufacturing Industries estimates differ from the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing, please consult the following document. Table 1 Manufacturing: Principal statistics – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Manufacturing sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Manufacturing sales: Provinces and territories – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Manufacturing sales by selected census metropolitan area – Unadjusted Table 5 Manufacturing capacity utilization rates by industry – Unadjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Monthly Survey of Manufacturing is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goal: Note to readers While the quality of this month's data remains high, response rates from manufacturers have fallen from the usual 95% to a rate of 88.1% in October. Every effort has been made to supplement this month's data with information from other sources. Monthly data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruptions. Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing, leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics and rubber products. Durable goods industries include wood products, non-metallic mineral products, primary metals, fabricated metal products, machinery, computer and electronic products, electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation equipment, furniture and related products, and miscellaneous manufacturing. Production-based industries For the aerospace and shipbuilding industries, the value of production is used instead of the value of sales of goods manufactured. The value of production is calculated by adjusting monthly sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories of goods in process and finished products manufactured. The value of production is used because of the extended period of time that it normally takes to manufacture products in these industries. Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled. New orders are those received, whether sold in the current month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the previous month to the current month. Manufacturers reporting sales, inventories and unfilled orders in US dollars Some Canadian manufacturers report sales, inventories and unfilled orders in US dollars. These data are then converted to Canadian dollars as part of the data production cycle. For sales, based on the assumption that they occur throughout the month, the average monthly exchange rate for the reference month established by the Bank of Canada is used for the conversion. The monthly average exchange rate is available in table 33-10-0163-01. Inventories and unfilled orders are reported at the end of the reference period. For most respondents, the daily average exchange rate on the last working day of the month is used for the conversion of these variables. However, some manufacturers choose to report their data as of a day other than the last day of the month. In these instances, the daily average exchange rate on the day selected by the respondent is used. Note that because of exchange rate fluctuations, the daily average exchange rate on the day selected by the respondent can differ from both the exchange rate on the last working day of the month and the monthly average exchange rate. Daily average exchange rate data are available in table 33-10-0036-01. Revision policy Each month, the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing releases preliminary data for the reference month and revised data for the three previous months. Revisions are made to reflect new information provided by respondents and updates to administrative data. Once a year, a revision project is undertaken to revise multiple years of data. Real-time data tables Real-time data tables 16-10-0118-01, 16-10-0119-01, 16-10-0014-01 and 16-10-0015-01 will be updated on December 22. Next release Data from the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing for November 2020 will be released on January 19, 2021.

For many children, the closures of childcare facilities and schools has significantly disrupted their daily routines and, for parents, this has resulted in increased caregiving responsibilities. Using data from the third web panel survey, the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 3: Resuming Economic and Social Activities during COVID-19, conducted from June 15 to 21, 2020, a new study released today examines gender differences in the self-reported division of parental tasks during the pandemic. Women reported that they were the ones who mostly performed the parental tasks in their household during the pandemic, including homeschooling. Further, employment status and work location affected the division of parental tasks within couples. For example, men who worked from home reported a more equal division of parenting tasks, but it was the opposite for women who worked from home as they were less likely to report sharing tasks equally and more likely to take on the bulk of the parenting responsibilities. Note to readers Statistics Canada's new Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) is a probabilistic panel survey based on a subsample of respondents selected from the Labour Force Survey. The CPSS is representative of the general population. There have been five waves of the CPSS so far. This analysis is based on data from Series 3, which was conducted from June 15 to 21.

National net worth grows as non-financial assets increase National net worth, the sum of national wealth and Canada's net foreign asset position, increased $572.6 billion from the previous quarter to $13,236.9 billion in the third quarter. This was largely fuelled by gains in the value of non-financial assets and an improvement in Canada's net foreign asset position, which represents the difference between the value of Canada's assets and liabilities with the rest of the world. On a per capita basis, national net worth increased from $331,732 to $344,816. Canada's net foreign asset position increased by $94.4 billion to $1,170.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. For a second consecutive quarter, the increase was due to higher equity prices and was moderated by the revaluation effect from fluctuations in exchange rates as well as net borrowings from abroad. Canada's net foreign asset position has increased by $191.3 billion since the beginning of 2020. Because a greater share of Canada's international assets is in the form of equity instruments than in international liabilities, stock price fluctuations tend to have a greater impact on the value of assets. National wealth, the value of non-financial assets in the Canadian economy, rose 4.1% to $12,066.8 billion in the third quarter. The value of residential real estate increased 3.2%, the largest quarterly increase since 2017, as property prices rose and interest rates remained favorable. Natural resource wealth increased $237.0 billion, due to a rebound in energy prices and production following a weak first half of 2020. The value of consumer durables, including automobiles, was up $21.4 billion primarily due to strong consumer spending in the quarter. Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic In the third quarter, the Canadian economy showed signs of recovery following widespread production shutdowns and other restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in the year. Canadians relied less on government support measures as employee compensation partially rebounded and many Canadians returned to work. Government transfers dropped compared with the previous quarter, but still contributed to a second consecutive quarter of strong household savings. Funds to support these government programs were primarily financed through record bond sales and issuances of short-term paper. In the third quarter, governments once again sold a previously unprecedented volume of bonds while significantly reducing their overall debt in the form of shorter-term instruments. Consequently, government debt continued to grow, but at a substantially slower pace than in the previous quarter. After sharp declines in equity markets earlier in the year, stock markets gradually climbed toward their pre-pandemic valuations. Despite this market recovery, there remains uncertainty surrounding the Canadian economy as COVID-19 infection rates rise and some regions enter lockdowns. Households reversed course on consumption after the sharp decline in the previous quarter as their demand for non-mortgage loans similarly strengthened and mortgage borrowing remained robust in the face of elevated housing demand and low interest rates. Chart 1 Change in national net worth by component Household net lending positive again Household sector saving, the funds available to increase wealth, was $56.8 billion, remaining elevated for a second consecutive quarter, following a record $90.1 billion in the second quarter. On a seasonally adjusted basis, in the third quarter, Canadians relied less on income support programs, resulting in a nearly 50% reduction in employment insurance benefits, as employment climbed to within 3.7% of its pre-COVID February level. Increased compensation did not fully offset reduced government support, resulting in household disposable income falling 3.1%; however, household disposable income was still 9.2% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019. Rising wages, coupled with still-elevated government transfers, helped offset a strong rebound in household spending. The savings rate stood at 14.6%, down from a record 27.5% in the second quarter, but significantly higher than the long-run average. While a larger share of savings was directed toward investment in non-financial assets, such as housing, households were net lenders for a second consecutive quarter; this means their transactions in financial assets exceeded those in liabilities (i.e., borrowing) as households added financial wealth overall. Household sector net worth, the value of all assets less liabilities, increased 3.0% to $12,301.2 billion in the third quarter, following a record 5.3% rebound in the second quarter. The value of financial assets rose $188.6 billion, largely due to a $114.7 billion increase in the value of equity, including notable growth in the value of mutual fund shares. Similarly, the Toronto Stock Exchange was up 3.9%, following a 16.0% increase one quarter earlier. Meanwhile, financial liabilities grew 1.9%, primarily owing to a record increase in mortgage borrowing. The value of non-financial assets grew $214.6 billion, mostly due to an increase of $183.8 billion in residential real estate. After a precipitous decline in residential resale activity in the second quarter, the volume of sales in dollars rebounded 88.8% in the third quarter, while the number of units sold rose 67.0%, as resale activity resumed and pent-up demand spurred price increases. Year over year, sales volumes were 60.4% higher than in the third quarter of 2019, the strongest quarter since 2009. Despite slowed residential resale activity in the second quarter, 5.8% more units were sold in the first three quarters of 2020 than in the same period in 2019. The value of residential real estate increased 3.2%, as over one-quarter of Canadians who worked most of their usual hours worked from home at the end of the quarter. Housing investment, which includes new purchases, was also at its highest point on record. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the increase was led by ownership transfer costs (+137.4%) and, to a lesser extent, renovation activity (+20.3%). On the liability side, households financed home purchases with a record increase in mortgages in the third quarter as the cost of borrowing hovered at all-time lows. Chart 2 Household savings rate, seasonally adjusted Chart 3 Household credit market debt, seasonally adjusted flows Credit market borrowing rebounds On a seasonally adjusted basis, total credit market borrowing increased from $7.2 billion to $38.4 billion in the third quarter. After reducing non-mortgage debt by $19.2 billion in the second quarter, households returned to accruing this type of debt, with a net increase of $9.7 billion. Demand for mortgage loans rose to $28.7 billion, setting a new high after record mortgage borrowing in the second quarter. The interest portion of payment deferrals accruing to the existing mortgage balance of borrowers accounted for a portion of mortgage demand over the last three quarters, peaking in the second quarter and declining substantially since then. The stock of credit market debt (consumer credit, and mortgage and non-mortgage loans) totalled $2,417.4 billion at the end of the quarter. Mortgage debt was $1,627.8 billion. Non-mortgage loans stood at $789.5 billion. Overall, the amount of debt in deferral as a result of the various relief measures provided by lenders had dropped significantly by the end of the third quarter. On a per capita basis, credit market debt increased from $62,345 to $62,971. The household debt service ratio, measured as total obligated payments of principal and interest on credit market debt as a proportion of household disposable income, increased to 13.22% from 12.36%, following the largest decline on record. While payment deferrals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on obligated principal paid, deferrals with six-month durations began winding down late in the third quarter. Although interest payments continue to be recorded on an accrual basis, as a result of payment deferrals, the total obligated mortgage payments were nearly 20% lower in the second quarter than without these deferrals. However, by the third quarter this had dropped to under 10%. Household credit market debt as a proportion of household disposable income rose from 162.8% to 170.7%, as the stock of credit market debt increased 1.6% and household disposable income decreased 3.1%. In other words, there was $1.71 in credit market debt for every dollar of household disposable income, compared with $1.81 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Household debt is aggregated across all income brackets; however, in general, credit market debt to disposable income tends to be higher for lower income quintiles. Chart 4 Household credit market debt to household disposable income, seasonally adjusted Federal government borrowing slows The federal government demand for credit market debt was $0.6 billion in the third quarter, a marked decrease from the $302.1 billion in funds raised in the second quarter. Sizeable borrowing in the form of federal bonds continued in the third quarter with net issuances of $77.4 billion, but these were largely offset by net retirements of short-term paper (-$76.2 billion), marking a shift from short- to longer-term borrowing. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank of Canada has been a key counterparty for federal government borrowing. Additionally, the federal government recorded a substantial draw down in currency and deposits as support programs continued in the third quarter; this followed a record increase in the second quarter fuelled by proceeds from the sales of bonds and treasury bills. Other levels of government (excluding social security funds) decreased their borrowing from $65.4 billion in the second quarter to $24.6 billion in the third quarter, of which provincial bond issuances made up the largest share. Other levels of government also reduced their liability position in short-term paper through net retirements of $4.6 billion. The ratio of federal government net debt (the book value of total financial liabilities less total financial assets) to gross domestic product (GDP) increased to 34.0%. The ratio of other government net debt to GDP edged down from 27.1% to 26.9%. Chart 5 Net debt (book value) as a percentage of gross domestic product Non-financial private corporations shift sources of financing The demand for funds by non-financial private corporations was $24.0 billion in the third quarter, up from $10.5 billion in the previous quarter. The funds were raised primarily through the issuance of equity, a marked shift from the reliance on bond issuances in the previous quarter. Borrowing in the form of non-mortgage loans continued to decline from the record level reached during the first quarter of 2020. This retrenching was mainly due to reduced loans with chartered banks (-$22.4 billion), with a return to pre-pandemic levels of debt with this lending sector. On the other hand, non-residents (+$8.9 billion) and the federal government (+$3.9 billion) continued to provide funds to non-financial private corporations, including through government programs, such as the Canadian Emergency Business Account, which extends loans to businesses. The program is ongoing until the first quarter of 2021. The debt-to-equity ratio (at market value) of non-financial private corporations fell from 206.1% to 200.5%. Non-financial private corporations' equity rose more than debt, as stock prices continued to make up for market losses experienced in the first quarter of 2020. Chart 6 Demand for funds by private non-financial corporations Financial sector supply of funds declines The financial sector provided $23.3 billion in funds to the economy through financial market instruments, down from $307.8 billion in the previous quarter. Third quarter financing was mainly in the form of bonds (+$89.5 billion), which were largely offset by retirements of short-term paper (-$83.7 billion). Increased mortgage lending outweighed lower demand for non-mortgage loans. Following a strong first quarter of lending, outstanding non-mortgage loan assets posted two consecutive quarterly declines, a trend that has not been seen since the financial crisis, when non-mortgage loans contracted for five straight quarters. The Bank of Canada, a subsector of the financial sector and a significant purchaser of government debt since the beginning of the pandemic, continued to add to its asset holdings, although the Bank's purchasing programs have begun to scale back. The expansion was primarily the result of increased holdings of long-term debt securities, which were partially offset by a large scale retirement of short-term paper, predominantly with a three-month term, issued earlier in the pandemic. The market value of financial assets was up 2.1% to $17,471.3 billion. Holdings of equity and investment fund shares (+$322.6 billion) increased in the quarter, while currency and deposit assets, mainly held by chartered banks, grew $71.2 billion and loan assets fell $5.9 billion. Mutual funds, whose wealth is held predominantly by households, experienced upward revaluations and positive flows in foreign equity and listed shares as markets started to return to pre-pandemic levels. Chart 7 Lending by the financial sector Table 1 National balance sheet accounts – Market value, not seasonally adjusted Table 2 Households and non-profit institutions serving household sector indicators – Market value Table 3 Corporations sector indicators – Not seasonally adjusted Table 4 General government sector indicators – Not seasonally adjusted Note to readers Revisions This third quarter release of the national balance sheet and financial flow accounts includes revised estimates from the first quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 2020. These data incorporate new and revised data, as well as updated data on seasonal trends. An overview of these conceptual, methodological, and statistics revisions is available in ""An overview of revisions to the Financial and Wealth Accounts, 1990 to 2020."" In the near future, data enhancements to the national balance sheet and financial flow accounts, such as the development of detailed counterparty information by sector, will be incorporated. To facilitate this initiative and others, it is necessary to extend the annual revision period (normally the previous three years) at the time of the third quarter release. Consequently, for the next two years, with the third quarter release of the financial and wealth accounts, data will be revised back to 1990 to ensure a continuous time series. Financial and wealth accounts on a from-whom-to-whom basis: Selected financial instruments The data visualization product ""Financial accounts on a from-whom-to-whom basis, selected financial instruments"" has been updated with data from the first quarter of 1990 to the third quarter of 2020. Next release Data on the national balance sheet and financial flow accounts for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be released on March 12, 2021. Overview of the Financial and Wealth Accounts This release of the Financial and Wealth Accounts comprises the National Balance Sheet Accounts (NBSA), the Financial Flow Accounts (FFA), and the other changes in assets account. The NBSA are composed of the balance sheets of all sectors and subsectors of the economy. The main sectors are households, non-profit institutions serving households, financial corporations, non-financial corporations, government and non-residents. The NBSA cover all national non-financial assets and all financial asset-liability claims outstanding in all sectors. To improve the interpretability of financial flows data, selected household borrowing series are available on a seasonally adjusted basis (table 38-10-0238-01). All other data are unadjusted for seasonal variation. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The FFA articulate net lending or borrowing activity by sector by measuring financial transactions in the economy. The FFA arrive at a measure of net financial investment, which is the difference between transactions in financial assets and liabilities (for example, net purchases of securities less net issuances of securities). The FFA also provide the link between financial and non-financial activity in the economy, which ties estimates of saving and non-financial capital acquisition (for example, investment in new housing) to the underlying financial transactions. While the FFA record changes in financial assets and liabilities between opening and closing balance sheets that are associated with transactions during the accounting period, the value of assets and liabilities held by an institution can also change for other reasons. These other types of changes, referred to as other economic flows, are recorded in the other changes in assets account. There are two main components to this account. One is the other changes in the volume of assets account. This account includes changes in non-financial and financial assets and liabilities relating to the economic appearance and disappearance of assets, the effects of external events such as wars or catastrophes on the value of assets, and changes in the classification and structure of assets. The other main component is the revaluation account, showing holding gains or losses accruing to the owners of non-financial and financial assets and liabilities during the accounting period as a result of changes in market price valuations. At present, only the aggregate other change in assets is available within the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts; no details are available on the different components. Definitions concerning financial indicators can be found in Financial indicators from the National Balance Sheet Accounts and in the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts glossary. Distributions of Household Economic Accounts The NBSA for the household sector is allocated across a number of socioeconomic dimensions as part of the Distributions of Household Economic Accounts (DHEA). Data tables containing wealth and its components by income quintile, age, generation and region are available in tables 36-10-0585-01, 36-10-0586-01, 36-10-0589-01, and 36-10-0590-01. Methodology for DHEA wealth estimates can be found in the article ""Distributions of Household Economic Accounts, estimates of asset, liability and net worth distributions, 2010 to 2019: Technical methodology and quality report.""

Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew for the sixth consecutive month, up 0.4% in October following a 0.8% increase in September. The upward movement of real GDP continued to offset the steepest drops on record in Canadian economic activity observed in March and April. Total economic activity was about 4% below February's pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product grows in October Both goods-producing (+0.1%) and services-producing (+0.5%) industries were up as 16 of 20 industrial sectors posted increases in October. Preliminary information indicates an approximate 0.4% increase in real GDP for November. Manufacturing, wholesale trade and finance and insurance led the growth, while construction tempered the increase. Owing to its preliminary nature, the estimate will be revised on January 29, 2021, with the release of the official GDP data for November. Finance and insurance expands The finance and insurance sector increased 0.8% in October, on widespread growth across all subsectors. Chart 2 Finance and insurance sector grows in October The momentum, seen in the third quarter in the securities markets, continued into October as the highest level of trading activity of federal government bonds—along with increased activity in other securities such as the money market and the repo bond market—contributed to a 2.2% growth in financial investment services and a 0.7% gain in depository credit intermediation and monetary authorities. Insurance carriers and related activities were up for the sixth consecutive month, increasing 0.4% in October. Manufacturing declines Following five months of growth, the manufacturing sector contracted 0.8% in October, largely as result of lower inventory formation. Durable manufacturing declined 2.5% in October as 7 of 10 subsectors were down. Contributing the most to the decline were transportation equipment (-3.7%), machinery (-4.1%) and fabricated metal product manufacturing (-3.5%), while wood products (+2.8%) and miscellaneous manufacturing (+1.7%) were up. Non-durable manufacturing rose 1.2% as six of nine subsectors were up, led by petroleum and coal products (+6.5%) and plastics and rubber products (+4.3%). Professional services keep growing The professional services sector grew 1.0% in October, up for the sixth consecutive month, as all types of service grew. Computer systems design and related services led the growth with a 1.1% increase in October. With the exception of declines in March and April, the industry has been continuously growing since November 2016. Legal services (+1.8%), management, scientific and technical consulting services (+1.6%) and architectural, engineering and related services (+0.8%) were other notable contributors. Public sector continues to grow The public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) grew 0.7% in October, as all three components were up. Health care and social assistance rose 0.9% as all subsectors, except for hospitals (-0.5%), increased. Educational services were up for the sixth consecutive month, rising 0.9% in the month. October marked the first full month of the new school year, following a late start in September, as continued efforts by elementary and secondary school teachers, support staff and administrators across the country to guide students (in-person or virtually) through a schoolyear like no other led to a 1.8% increase in elementary and secondary schools. Public administration grew 0.4%. Accommodation and food services down Activity in the accommodation and food services sector declined for the second consecutive month, contracting 3.9% in October, as momentum from the spring-reopening and summer season continued to dissipate. As the mercury began to drop across the country—effectively bringing to a close ""al fresco"" dining season—and the number of COVID-19 cases and public health measures related to indoor dining increased, the output of food services and drinking places fell 4.5% in October. Aside from the contractions in March and April, this was the largest monthly decline in the subsector since January 1991. Accommodation services were down 2.1% as continued domestic and international travel restrictions, along with rising COVID-19 cases across the country, contributed to the pullback in the subsector. Construction grows across most types of activity Following a 0.6% decrease in September, the construction sector grew 0.7% in October, as the majority of subsectors increased. Residential construction grew 1.9% in October as single-unit and multi-unit dwelling construction, along with home alterations and improvements, all contributed to the sixth consecutive monthly growth. Repair construction increased 1.4%, while engineering and other construction edged up 0.3%. Non-residential construction was down for the fourth consecutive month, declining 2.1% in October, as all three types of non-residential construction (commercial, industrial and public) decreased. Wholesale resumes growth The wholesale trade sector was up 0.8% in October as six of nine subsectors contributed to the growth. With the fourth expansion in the last six months, the sector largely offset declines experienced in March and April and edged closer to the pre-pandemic level of activity. Machinery, equipment and supplies wholesaling (+1.9%) led the growth as higher imports and exports of all types of machinery commodities contributed to increases in the subsector. Building materials and supplies wholesaling was up 2.6%, benefiting from increased construction activity. Offsetting some of the growth were food, beverage and tobacco (-1.7%) and petroleum and petroleum products wholesaling (-2.3%). Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction essentially unchanged Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction was essentially unchanged in October as gains in oil and gas extraction and support activities offset mining and quarrying contractions. Oil and gas extraction (+1.2%) grew for the second month in a row, as a 3.3% increase in oil sands extraction more than offset a 1.0% decline in oil and gas extraction (except oil sands). Support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction grew 2.4% on account of higher rigging services and support activities for mining. Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) decreased 3.7%, as a decline in potash mining (-25.1%) and metal ore mining (-1.8%) more than offset a 13.0% uptick in coal mining. Other industries Following five months of growth to reach unprecedented record-setting levels, activity at the offices of real estate agents and brokers decreased 1.9% in October, as lower housing resale activity in the Greater Toronto, Hamilton-Burlington and the Greater Vancouver areas contributed most to the decline. Nevertheless, the level of activity was second only to the peak reached in September. Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting rose 1.6% in October, up for the third consecutive month, as three of five subsectors grew. Higher crop production (+2.3%), stemming from elevated grain and cannabis production, contributed the most to the growth. Utilities rose 0.9% in October, largely offsetting two previous monthly declines, as higher electric power generation, transmission and distribution (+0.7%) and natural gas distribution (+3.1%) contributed to the growth. Transportation and warehousing grew 0.8% in October, as 7 of 10 subsectors were up, led by pipeline transportation (+2.9%) of both oil and natural gas and support activities for transportation (+1.7%). Truck transportation (-0.8%) and postal service, couriers and messaging services (-1.1%) offset some of the growth. Retail trade edged up 0.3% in October as the 10 subsectors were evenly split between increases and decreases. Chart 3 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product Table 1 Monthly gross domestic product by industry at basic prices in chained (2012) dollars – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The release on gross domestic product by industry is an example of how Statistics Canada supports global sustainable development goal reporting. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Monthly data on gross domestic product (GDP) by industry at basic prices are chained volume estimates with 2012 as the reference year. This means that the data for each industry and each aggregate are obtained from a chained volume index multiplied by the industry's value added in 2012. The monthly data are benchmarked to annually chained Fisher volume indexes of GDP obtained from the constant-price supply and use tables (SUTs) up to the latest SUT year (2017). For the period starting in January 2018, data are derived by chaining a fixed-weight Laspeyres volume index to the prior period. The fixed weights are 2017 industry prices. This approach makes the monthly GDP by industry data more comparable with expenditure-based GDP data, which are chained quarterly. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Revisions With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions have been made back to January 2016. Each month, newly available administrative and survey data from various industries in the economy are integrated, resulting in statistical revisions. Updated and revised administrative data (including taxation statistics), new information provided by respondents to industry surveys, and standard changes to seasonal adjustment calculations are incorporated with each release. Real-time table Real-time table 36-10-0491-01 will be updated on January 11, 2021. Next release Data on GDP by industry for November 2020 will be released on January 29, 2021.

Retail sales edged up 0.4% to $54.6 billion in October, marking the sixth consecutive monthly increase since the record decline in April. The sales growth was led by motor vehicle and parts dealers. Core retail sales—which excludes gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—edged up 0.3%, on higher sales at sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+11.8%), furniture and home furnishings stores (+6.6%), as well as building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.9%). Retail sales increased in 6 of 11 subsectors, representing 50.9% of retail trade. In volume terms, sales edged up 0.2% in October. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales were relatively unchanged in November. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 55% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 87.9%. Chart 1 Retail sales edge up in October Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers Sales increased at all four store types within motor vehicle and parts dealers (+1.5%), led by new car dealers (+0.8%). Year over year, sales of new passenger cars declined 23.2%, while new trucks, an aggregate group which includes light trucks, heavy trucks and buses, increased 4.1% from October 2019. After a 2.5% year-over-year increase in September, the value of New Motor Vehicles declined 0.7% in October, compared with the same month last year. Sales at gasoline stations (-2.7%) declined for the first time in six months. In volume terms, sales were down 2.8%. Core retail sales continue to rise Core retail sales edged up 0.3% in October following a 2.1% increase in September. Sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+11.8%) reported higher sales following three consecutive months of declines. Sales at furniture and home furnishings stores rose for the second consecutive month, up 6.6% in October. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.9%) rose for the third consecutive month. Chart 2 Sales up in 6 of 11 subsectors Sales up in seven provinces In British Columbia, sales rose 2.1%, with health and personal care stores, as well as building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers both contributing the most to the increase. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Vancouver, sales rose 2.8%. Sales in Alberta rose 1.1% on higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Sales in Ontario (-0.4%) fell for the first time since April, coinciding with a record number of COVID-19 cases and stricter public health measures within the province. The decrease was led by clothing and clothing accessories stores. In the CMA of Toronto, sales were down 1.2%. New Brunswick (-4.3%) also reported a decline, on lower sales at general merchandise stores. Retail e-commerce sales in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached $3.1 billion in October, accounting for 5.2% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales fell 0.3 percentage points from September, but was up 1.8 percentage points year over year. Retail e-commerce sales were up by two-thirds (+67.7%) year over year in October, while total unadjusted retail sales increased 9.1%. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce declined 5.0%.

Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advanced estimate for retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are the exact same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruptions. For information regarding cannabis statistics, consult the Cannabis Stats Hub. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type do not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 45411—Electronic Shopping and Mail Order Houses. The second type have a storefront and are commonly referred to as brick-and-mortar retailers. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they too are classified to NAICS 45411. Some common electronic commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current dollar values using consumer price indexes.

Employment Insurance (EI) statistics are now available for the month of October. EI statistics complement information available from other sources—notably the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH)—and contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions in Canada. New indicators, such as the proportion of regular EI beneficiaries who qualified under new rules introduced on September 27, 2020, and the number of beneficiaries by industry, are particularly valuable in understanding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on Canadian workers and employers. October results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of October 11 to 17. By then, several provinces had tightened public health measures in response to increases in COVID-19 cases. Unlike the widespread economic shutdown implemented in March and April, these measures were targeted at businesses where the risk of COVID transmission is greatest, including indoor restaurants, bars and recreational facilities. The release of the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program was suspended from March to September. During this period, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was introduced and the number of EI recipients dropped significantly. EI statistics for this period are also now available. CERB data will be featured in future Statistics Canada analytical and research products. Record number of regular EI beneficiaries in October In October, on a seasonally adjusted basis, 1.4 million Canadians received regular EI benefits, more than triple the number in February (446,000). This was the highest number of EI recipients in Canada since comparable data became available in 1997. In comparison, immediately following the recession of 2008/2009, the number of EI beneficiaries peaked at 822,000 in June 2009. To support Canadians facing the labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, CERB was introduced in March 2020. The number of regular EI beneficiaries increased in March and April, as those with active claims remained in the EI program. It then declined sharply beginning in May, as all new claims were redirected to CERB, and reached a low of 160,000 in August. Results from the LFS indicate there were 1.8 million unemployed in October, including 1.5 million who were looking for work and 300,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Record number of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries in October Changes to the EI program lead to increases in the number of regular EI beneficiaries On September 27, 2020, the Government of Canada introduced temporary changes to the EI program to facilitate the transition of CERB recipients to EI and to increase EI eligibility. These new measures included a reduction in the number of insured hours required to qualify for regular EI benefits. In October, 11.2% of regular EI recipients qualified under these new EI rules and would not have qualified under the previous rules (not seasonally adjusted). The province of Quebec had the highest share of EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new EI rules, at 14.3%, driven by higher proportions in the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Trois-Rivières (20.1%), Saguenay (19.8%) and Québec (18.6%). The most recent results from the LFS indicate that, after five consecutive months of gains, employment in Quebec was little changed in October and November. New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan also had proportions of EI beneficiaries who qualified under new rules which exceeded the national average, while Alberta recorded the lowest proportion (8.1%) of all provinces. The proportion of recipients qualifying under the new EI rules was highest among youth aged 15 to 24 (19.1%). As youth are less likely to be employed full-time, they would previously have been less likely to have the amount of insurable hours required to qualify for EI. According to results from the LFS, employment remained furthest from pre-pandemic levels among youth in October. Chart 1 Percentage of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020, October 2020, not seasonally adjusted Largest increases in EI beneficiaries among census metropolitan areas The number of overall regular EI beneficiaries increased in all provinces from February to October, led by British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. While each of the four Atlantic provinces saw more modest increases in EI beneficiaries over this period, they led all provinces in October in the number of EI beneficiaries as a proportion of the total labour force. Outside of the Atlantic provinces, Alberta had the highest proportion of beneficiaries relative to their labour force, while Manitoba had the lowest. Compared with October 2019, the number of EI beneficiaries in all provinces increased proportionally more in the services-producing sector than in the goods-producing sector (not seasonally adjusted). New EI beneficiary data provide additional insight into differences in the impact of COVID-19 on regional labour markets across Canada. The increase in the number of EI beneficiaries from February to October was proportionally greater in CMAs and census agglomerations (CAs) (+269%; +804,000) than in areas outside of CMAs/CAs (+70.5%; +104,000). As a result, the geographic distribution of beneficiaries within provinces shifted over the same period. Within British Columbia, for example, the CMA of Vancouver accounted for more than one-half of recipients (55.2%) in October, compared with just over one-third (34.7%) in February. Chart 2 Atlantic provinces have highest proportion of regular EI beneficiaries relative to their labour force Women now account for half of all regular EI beneficiaries Prior to the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, women made up a lower proportion (37.3%) of regular EI recipients than men (62.7%) in February. Following cumulative February-to-October increases of 508,000 (+305%), women accounted for 49.8% of regular EI beneficiaries in October, the first time they have accounted for half of beneficiaries since comparable data became available in 1997. From February to October, the number of regular beneficiaries increased by 400,000 (+143%) among men. Results from the LFS indicate that women accounted for a disproportionate share of the job losses at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March. The number of youth aged 15 to 24 receiving regular EI benefits increased by 137,000 from February to October, including increases of 72,000 (+597%) among young women and 64,000 (+226%) among young men. LFS results indicate that, as of October, employment remained farther from pre-COVID February levels among young women (-11.5%) than among all other major demographic groups. The proportion of EI recipients who qualified under the new rules introduced in September 2020 was higher among women (11.8%) than men (10.6%). A similar pattern was observed among youth, with young women being more likely to qualify under the new rules than young men (20.0% versus 18.3%). Chart 3 Women now account for half of regular EI beneficiaries Looking ahead As both workers and industries continue to adapt to the new realities associated with COVID-19 over the coming months, EIS, in combination with the LFS, the SEPH and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, will be an important source of insights on sectoral and economy-wide labour market conditions in Canada. In October, 32.8% of all regular EI beneficiaries last worked in three industries hardest-hit by public health measures, including accommodation and food services (18.3%); retail trade (10.5%); and arts, entertainment and recreation (4.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). Future shifts in the distribution of beneficiaries by industry and occupation will be an indication of the extent to which labour demand has recovered in these industries, as well as the ability of workers from these industries to find their way back to employment. Similarly, in October almost 7 in 10 (67.2%) regular EI beneficiaries had not made a previous paid claim within the last 5 years, compared with just over 4 in 10 (42.2%) at the same period last year, reflecting the widespread labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown. Future changes in this indicator will contribute to an understanding of the ability of Canadian workers to recover from these impacts and avoid future spells of unemployment. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada Recovery Benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)). Concepts and methodology The analysis presented here focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. Claims data pertain to initial and renewal claims received for any type of EI benefits, including special benefits. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. Regular EI benefits are paid to eligible individuals who lose their jobs and who are available for and able to work, but cannot find a job. To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a claim. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits, and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March to October 2020 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Numbers in the Daily text are rounded to the nearest thousand. The number of regular EI beneficiaries and the number of claims received for the current month and the previous month are subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received EI benefits from October 11 to 17. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. However, claims data are for the entire month. New indicators for October 2020 1. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals that only qualified for EI in October 2020 as a result of these program changes. 2. Beneficiaries who have not made a previous paid claim within the last five years The indicator of whether a beneficiary has made a previous paid claim in the past five years is based only on claims for EI. Whether or not the beneficiary received CERB payments between March and September 2020 is not used in the calculation of this indicator. 3. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and Record of Employment (ROE) administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. Geographical definitions A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centered on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – definitions for more information. Data availability A number of CODR data tables published on the Statistics Canada website remain suspended with the release of the October 2020 data. 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337: remain suspended, as of the December 2019 reference period, due to occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is on-going to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007, and 14-10-0008: remain suspended, as of the March 2020 reference period, due to a source data file containing records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. 14-10-0009: for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed due to data quality. Next release Data on EI for November 2020 will be released on January 21, 2021.

Retail sales rose 1.1% to $53.9 billion in September—the fifth consecutive monthly increase since the record decline in April. Core retail sales—which excludes gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—also rose 1.1%, on higher sales at general merchandise stores and food and beverage stores. Retail sales were up in 9 of 11 subsectors, representing 93.2% of retail trade. In volume terms, sales were up 1.1% in September. Rounding out the third quarter, retail sales were up 22.6% compared with the second quarter. In volume terms, retail sales rose 21.5%. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales were relatively unchanged in October. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 50% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 88.5%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in September Core retail sales rise on higher sales at general merchandise and food and beverage stores Core retail sales rose at almost three times the pace (+1.1%) in September compared with August (+0.4%), led by the first increase at general merchandise stores (+1.8%) in three months. Sales at food and beverage stores (+0.9%) rose for the second consecutive month, partially due to higher prices for meat, fish and dairy products. Retail sales bounced back at furniture and home furnishings stores (+4.5%) following a 2.0% decrease in August. Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased for the fifth consecutive month, up 1.5% in September (seasonally adjusted) and 1.7% above February levels. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, new motor vehicle sales were up 2.5% year over year in dollar terms in September. Sales of trucks, an aggregate group which includes light trucks, heavy trucks and buses, increased 5.7% year over year, while passenger car sales declined 12.5%. New motor vehicle sales exceeded the pre-pandemic level (February 2020) by over one-third (+36.9%) in September. Sales at gasoline stations (+0.2%) rose for the fifth consecutive month in September. In volume terms, sales were up 0.6%. Chart 2 Sales up in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales up in eight provinces In Ontario, sales rose 1.0% with general merchandise stores leading the growth. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, sales increased 1.2%. In Alberta, retail sales were up 2.5% in September, led by higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers also drove the sales growth in British Columbia (+1.7%). In the CMA of Vancouver, sales rose 0.9%. Sales in Quebec rose for the fifth consecutive month, edging up 0.2% in September. In the CMA of Montréal, sales were up 0.4%. Retail e-commerce sales in Canada up by three-quarters year over year On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached $3.2 billion in September, accounting for 5.6% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales rose 0.5 percentage points from August—despite more retailers expanding in-person shopping in accordance with public health measures—and was up 2.1 percentage points year over year. Retail e-commerce sales were up 74.3% year over year in September, while total unadjusted retail sales increased 9.3%. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce rose 8.1%.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew for the sixth consecutive month, up 0.4% in October following a 0.8% increase in September. The upward movement of real GDP continued to offset the steepest drops on record in Canadian economic activity observed in March and April. Total economic activity was about 4% below February's pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product grows in October Both goods-producing (+0.1%) and services-producing (+0.5%) industries were up as 16 of 20 industrial sectors posted increases in October. Preliminary information indicates an approximate 0.4% increase in real GDP for November. Manufacturing, wholesale trade and finance and insurance led the growth, while construction tempered the increase. Owing to its preliminary nature, the estimate will be revised on January 29, 2021, with the release of the official GDP data for November. Finance and insurance expands The finance and insurance sector increased 0.8% in October, on widespread growth across all subsectors. Chart 2 Finance and insurance sector grows in October The momentum, seen in the third quarter in the securities markets, continued into October as the highest level of trading activity of federal government bonds—along with increased activity in other securities such as the money market and the repo bond market—contributed to a 2.2% growth in financial investment services and a 0.7% gain in depository credit intermediation and monetary authorities. Insurance carriers and related activities were up for the sixth consecutive month, increasing 0.4% in October. Manufacturing declines Following five months of growth, the manufacturing sector contracted 0.8% in October, largely as result of lower inventory formation. Durable manufacturing declined 2.5% in October as 7 of 10 subsectors were down. Contributing the most to the decline were transportation equipment (-3.7%), machinery (-4.1%) and fabricated metal product manufacturing (-3.5%), while wood products (+2.8%) and miscellaneous manufacturing (+1.7%) were up. Non-durable manufacturing rose 1.2% as six of nine subsectors were up, led by petroleum and coal products (+6.5%) and plastics and rubber products (+4.3%). Professional services keep growing The professional services sector grew 1.0% in October, up for the sixth consecutive month, as all types of service grew. Computer systems design and related services led the growth with a 1.1% increase in October. With the exception of declines in March and April, the industry has been continuously growing since November 2016. Legal services (+1.8%), management, scientific and technical consulting services (+1.6%) and architectural, engineering and related services (+0.8%) were other notable contributors. Public sector continues to grow The public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) grew 0.7% in October, as all three components were up. Health care and social assistance rose 0.9% as all subsectors, except for hospitals (-0.5%), increased. Educational services were up for the sixth consecutive month, rising 0.9% in the month. October marked the first full month of the new school year, following a late start in September, as continued efforts by elementary and secondary school teachers, support staff and administrators across the country to guide students (in-person or virtually) through a schoolyear like no other led to a 1.8% increase in elementary and secondary schools. Public administration grew 0.4%. Accommodation and food services down Activity in the accommodation and food services sector declined for the second consecutive month, contracting 3.9% in October, as momentum from the spring-reopening and summer season continued to dissipate. As the mercury began to drop across the country—effectively bringing to a close ""al fresco"" dining season—and the number of COVID-19 cases and public health measures related to indoor dining increased, the output of food services and drinking places fell 4.5% in October. Aside from the contractions in March and April, this was the largest monthly decline in the subsector since January 1991. Accommodation services were down 2.1% as continued domestic and international travel restrictions, along with rising COVID-19 cases across the country, contributed to the pullback in the subsector. Construction grows across most types of activity Following a 0.6% decrease in September, the construction sector grew 0.7% in October, as the majority of subsectors increased. Residential construction grew 1.9% in October as single-unit and multi-unit dwelling construction, along with home alterations and improvements, all contributed to the sixth consecutive monthly growth. Repair construction increased 1.4%, while engineering and other construction edged up 0.3%. Non-residential construction was down for the fourth consecutive month, declining 2.1% in October, as all three types of non-residential construction (commercial, industrial and public) decreased. Wholesale resumes growth The wholesale trade sector was up 0.8% in October as six of nine subsectors contributed to the growth. With the fourth expansion in the last six months, the sector largely offset declines experienced in March and April and edged closer to the pre-pandemic level of activity. Machinery, equipment and supplies wholesaling (+1.9%) led the growth as higher imports and exports of all types of machinery commodities contributed to increases in the subsector. Building materials and supplies wholesaling was up 2.6%, benefiting from increased construction activity. Offsetting some of the growth were food, beverage and tobacco (-1.7%) and petroleum and petroleum products wholesaling (-2.3%). Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction essentially unchanged Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction was essentially unchanged in October as gains in oil and gas extraction and support activities offset mining and quarrying contractions. Oil and gas extraction (+1.2%) grew for the second month in a row, as a 3.3% increase in oil sands extraction more than offset a 1.0% decline in oil and gas extraction (except oil sands). Support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction grew 2.4% on account of higher rigging services and support activities for mining. Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) decreased 3.7%, as a decline in potash mining (-25.1%) and metal ore mining (-1.8%) more than offset a 13.0% uptick in coal mining. Other industries Following five months of growth to reach unprecedented record-setting levels, activity at the offices of real estate agents and brokers decreased 1.9% in October, as lower housing resale activity in the Greater Toronto, Hamilton-Burlington and the Greater Vancouver areas contributed most to the decline. Nevertheless, the level of activity was second only to the peak reached in September. Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting rose 1.6% in October, up for the third consecutive month, as three of five subsectors grew. Higher crop production (+2.3%), stemming from elevated grain and cannabis production, contributed the most to the growth. Utilities rose 0.9% in October, largely offsetting two previous monthly declines, as higher electric power generation, transmission and distribution (+0.7%) and natural gas distribution (+3.1%) contributed to the growth. Transportation and warehousing grew 0.8% in October, as 7 of 10 subsectors were up, led by pipeline transportation (+2.9%) of both oil and natural gas and support activities for transportation (+1.7%). Truck transportation (-0.8%) and postal service, couriers and messaging services (-1.1%) offset some of the growth. Retail trade edged up 0.3% in October as the 10 subsectors were evenly split between increases and decreases. Chart 3 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product Table 1 Monthly gross domestic product by industry at basic prices in chained (2012) dollars – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The release on gross domestic product by industry is an example of how Statistics Canada supports global sustainable development goal reporting. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Monthly data on gross domestic product (GDP) by industry at basic prices are chained volume estimates with 2012 as the reference year. This means that the data for each industry and each aggregate are obtained from a chained volume index multiplied by the industry's value added in 2012. The monthly data are benchmarked to annually chained Fisher volume indexes of GDP obtained from the constant-price supply and use tables (SUTs) up to the latest SUT year (2017). For the period starting in January 2018, data are derived by chaining a fixed-weight Laspeyres volume index to the prior period. The fixed weights are 2017 industry prices. This approach makes the monthly GDP by industry data more comparable with expenditure-based GDP data, which are chained quarterly. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Revisions With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions have been made back to January 2016. Each month, newly available administrative and survey data from various industries in the economy are integrated, resulting in statistical revisions. Updated and revised administrative data (including taxation statistics), new information provided by respondents to industry surveys, and standard changes to seasonal adjustment calculations are incorporated with each release. Real-time table Real-time table 36-10-0491-01 will be updated on January 11, 2021. Next release Data on GDP by industry for November 2020 will be released on January 29, 2021.

Retail sales edged up 0.4% to $54.6 billion in October, marking the sixth consecutive monthly increase since the record decline in April. The sales growth was led by motor vehicle and parts dealers. Core retail sales—which excludes gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—edged up 0.3%, on higher sales at sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+11.8%), furniture and home furnishings stores (+6.6%), as well as building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.9%). Retail sales increased in 6 of 11 subsectors, representing 50.9% of retail trade. In volume terms, sales edged up 0.2% in October. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales were relatively unchanged in November. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 55% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 87.9%. Chart 1 Retail sales edge up in October Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers Sales increased at all four store types within motor vehicle and parts dealers (+1.5%), led by new car dealers (+0.8%). Year over year, sales of new passenger cars declined 23.2%, while new trucks, an aggregate group which includes light trucks, heavy trucks and buses, increased 4.1% from October 2019. After a 2.5% year-over-year increase in September, the value of New Motor Vehicles declined 0.7% in October, compared with the same month last year. Sales at gasoline stations (-2.7%) declined for the first time in six months. In volume terms, sales were down 2.8%. Core retail sales continue to rise Core retail sales edged up 0.3% in October following a 2.1% increase in September.

Sales at furniture and home furnishings stores rose for the second consecutive month, up 6.6% in October. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.9%) rose for the third consecutive month. Chart 2 Sales up in 6 of 11 subsectors Sales up in seven provinces In British Columbia, sales rose 2.1%, with health and personal care stores, as well as building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers both contributing the most to the increase. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Vancouver, sales rose 2.8%. Sales in Alberta rose 1.1% on higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Sales in Ontario (-0.4%) fell for the first time since April, coinciding with a record number of COVID-19 cases and stricter public health measures within the province. The decrease was led by clothing and clothing accessories stores. In the CMA of Toronto, sales were down 1.2%. New Brunswick (-4.3%) also reported a decline, on lower sales at general merchandise stores. Retail e-commerce sales in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached $3.1 billion in October, accounting for 5.2% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales fell 0.3 percentage points from September, but was up 1.8 percentage points year over year. Retail e-commerce sales were up by two-thirds (+67.7%) year over year in October, while total unadjusted retail sales increased 9.1%. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce declined 5.0%.

Employment Insurance (EI) statistics are now available for the month of October. EI statistics complement information available from other sources—notably the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH)—and contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions in Canada. New indicators, such as the proportion of regular EI beneficiaries who qualified under new rules introduced on September 27, 2020, and the number of beneficiaries by industry, are particularly valuable in understanding the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on Canadian workers and employers. October results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of October 11 to 17. By then, several provinces had tightened public health measures in response to increases in COVID-19 cases. Unlike the widespread economic shutdown implemented in March and April, these measures were targeted at businesses where the risk of COVID transmission is greatest, including indoor restaurants, bars and recreational facilities. The release of the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program was suspended from March to September. During this period, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was introduced and the number of EI recipients dropped significantly. EI statistics for this period are also now available. CERB data will be featured in future Statistics Canada analytical and research products. Record number of regular EI beneficiaries in October In October, on a seasonally adjusted basis, 1.4 million Canadians received regular EI benefits, more than triple the number in February (446,000). This was the highest number of EI recipients in Canada since comparable data became available in 1997. In comparison, immediately following the recession of 2008/2009, the number of EI beneficiaries peaked at 822,000 in June 2009. To support Canadians facing the labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, CERB was introduced in March 2020. The number of regular EI beneficiaries increased in March and April, as those with active claims remained in the EI program. It then declined sharply beginning in May, as all new claims were redirected to CERB, and reached a low of 160,000 in August. Results from the LFS indicate there were 1.8 million unemployed in October, including 1.5 million who were looking for work and 300,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Record number of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries in October Changes to the EI program lead to increases in the number of regular EI beneficiaries On September 27, 2020, the Government of Canada introduced temporary changes to the EI program to facilitate the transition of CERB recipients to EI and to increase EI eligibility. These new measures included a reduction in the number of insured hours required to qualify for regular EI benefits. In October, 11.2% of regular EI recipients qualified under these new EI rules and would not have qualified under the previous rules (not seasonally adjusted). The province of Quebec had the highest share of EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new EI rules, at 14.3%, driven by higher proportions in the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Trois-Rivières (20.1%), Saguenay (19.8%) and Québec (18.6%). The most recent results from the LFS indicate that, after five consecutive months of gains, employment in Quebec was little changed in October and November. New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan also had proportions of EI beneficiaries who qualified under new rules which exceeded the national average, while Alberta recorded the lowest proportion (8.1%) of all provinces. The proportion of recipients qualifying under the new EI rules was highest among youth aged 15 to 24 (19.1%). As youth are less likely to be employed full-time, they would previously have been less likely to have the amount of insurable hours required to qualify for EI. According to results from the LFS, employment remained furthest from pre-pandemic levels among youth in October. Chart 1 Percentage of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020, October 2020, not seasonally adjusted Largest increases in EI beneficiaries among census metropolitan areas The number of overall regular EI beneficiaries increased in all provinces from February to October, led by British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. While each of the four Atlantic provinces saw more modest increases in EI beneficiaries over this period, they led all provinces in October in the number of EI beneficiaries as a proportion of the total labour force. Outside of the Atlantic provinces, Alberta had the highest proportion of beneficiaries relative to their labour force, while Manitoba had the lowest. Compared with October 2019, the number of EI beneficiaries in all provinces increased proportionally more in the services-producing sector than in the goods-producing sector (not seasonally adjusted). New EI beneficiary data provide additional insight into differences in the impact of COVID-19 on regional labour markets across Canada. The increase in the number of EI beneficiaries from February to October was proportionally greater in CMAs and census agglomerations (CAs) (+269%; +804,000) than in areas outside of CMAs/CAs (+70.5%; +104,000). As a result, the geographic distribution of beneficiaries within provinces shifted over the same period. Within British Columbia, for example, the CMA of Vancouver accounted for more than one-half of recipients (55.2%) in October, compared with just over one-third (34.7%) in February. Chart 2 Atlantic provinces have highest proportion of regular EI beneficiaries relative to their labour force Women now account for half of all regular EI beneficiaries Prior to the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, women made up a lower proportion (37.3%) of regular EI recipients than men (62.7%) in February. Following cumulative February-to-October increases of 508,000 (+305%), women accounted for 49.8% of regular EI beneficiaries in October, the first time they have accounted for half of beneficiaries since comparable data became available in 1997. From February to October, the number of regular beneficiaries increased by 400,000 (+143%) among men. Results from the LFS indicate that women accounted for a disproportionate share of the job losses at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March. The number of youth aged 15 to 24 receiving regular EI benefits increased by 137,000 from February to October, including increases of 72,000 (+597%) among young women and 64,000 (+226%) among young men. LFS results indicate that, as of October, employment remained farther from pre-COVID February levels among young women (-11.5%) than among all other major demographic groups. The proportion of EI recipients who qualified under the new rules introduced in September 2020 was higher among women (11.8%) than men (10.6%). A similar pattern was observed among youth, with young women being more likely to qualify under the new rules than young men (20.0% versus 18.3%). Chart 3 Women now account for half of regular EI beneficiaries Looking ahead As both workers and industries continue to adapt to the new realities associated with COVID-19 over the coming months, EIS, in combination with the LFS, the SEPH and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, will be an important source of insights on sectoral and economy-wide labour market conditions in Canada. In October, 32.8% of all regular EI beneficiaries last worked in three industries hardest-hit by public health measures, including accommodation and food services (18.3%); retail trade (10.5%); and arts, entertainment and recreation (4.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). Future shifts in the distribution of beneficiaries by industry and occupation will be an indication of the extent to which labour demand has recovered in these industries, as well as the ability of workers from these industries to find their way back to employment. Similarly, in October almost 7 in 10 (67.2%) regular EI beneficiaries had not made a previous paid claim within the last 5 years, compared with just over 4 in 10 (42.2%) at the same period last year, reflecting the widespread labour market impact of the COVID-19 economic shutdown. Future changes in this indicator will contribute to an understanding of the ability of Canadian workers to recover from these impacts and avoid future spells of unemployment. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada Recovery Benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)). Concepts and methodology The analysis presented here focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. Claims data pertain to initial and renewal claims received for any type of EI benefits, including special benefits. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. Regular EI benefits are paid to eligible individuals who lose their jobs and who are available for and able to work, but cannot find a job. To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a claim. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits, and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March to October 2020 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Numbers in the Daily text are rounded to the nearest thousand. The number of regular EI beneficiaries and the number of claims received for the current month and the previous month are subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received EI benefits from October 11 to 17. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. However, claims data are for the entire month. New indicators for October 2020 1. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals that only qualified for EI in October 2020 as a result of these program changes. 2. Beneficiaries who have not made a previous paid claim within the last five years The indicator of whether a beneficiary has made a previous paid claim in the past five years is based only on claims for EI. Whether or not the beneficiary received CERB payments between March and September 2020 is not used in the calculation of this indicator. 3. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and Record of Employment (ROE) administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. Geographical definitions A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centered on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – definitions for more information. Data availability A number of CODR data tables published on the Statistics Canada website remain suspended with the release of the October 2020 data. 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337: remain suspended, as of the December 2019 reference period, due to occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is on-going to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007, and 14-10-0008: remain suspended, as of the March 2020 reference period, due to a source data file containing records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. 14-10-0009: for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed due to data quality. Next release Data on EI for November 2020 will be released on January 21, 2021.

Retail sales rose 1.1% to $53.9 billion in September—the fifth consecutive monthly increase since the record decline in April. Core retail sales—which excludes gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—also rose 1.1%, on higher sales at general merchandise stores and food and beverage stores. Retail sales were up in 9 of 11 subsectors, representing 93.2% of retail trade. In volume terms, sales were up 1.1% in September. Rounding out the third quarter, retail sales were up 22.6% compared with the second quarter. In volume terms, retail sales rose 21.5%. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales were relatively unchanged in October. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 50% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 88.5%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in September Core retail sales rise on higher sales at general merchandise and food and beverage stores Core retail sales rose at almost three times the pace (+1.1%) in September compared with August (+0.4%), led by the first increase at general merchandise stores (+1.8%) in three months. Sales at food and beverage stores (+0.9%) rose for the second consecutive month, partially due to higher prices for meat, fish and dairy products. Retail sales bounced back at furniture and home furnishings stores (+4.5%) following a 2.0% decrease in August. Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased for the fifth consecutive month, up 1.5% in September (seasonally adjusted) and 1.7% above February levels. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, new motor vehicle sales were up 2.5% year over year in dollar terms in September. Sales of trucks, an aggregate group which includes light trucks, heavy trucks and buses, increased 5.7% year over year, while passenger car sales declined 12.5%. New motor vehicle sales exceeded the pre-pandemic level (February 2020) by over one-third (+36.9%) in September. Sales at gasoline stations (+0.2%) rose for the fifth consecutive month in September. In volume terms, sales were up 0.6%. Chart 2 Sales up in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales up in eight provinces In Ontario, sales rose 1.0% with general merchandise stores leading the growth. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, sales increased 1.2%. In Alberta, retail sales were up 2.5% in September, led by higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers also drove the sales growth in British Columbia (+1.7%). In the CMA of Vancouver, sales rose 0.9%. Sales in Quebec rose for the fifth consecutive month, edging up 0.2% in September. In the CMA of Montréal, sales were up 0.4%. Retail e-commerce sales in Canada up by three-quarters year over year On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached $3.2 billion in September, accounting for 5.6% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales rose 0.5 percentage points from August—despite more retailers expanding in-person shopping in accordance with public health measures—and was up 2.1 percentage points year over year. Retail e-commerce sales were up 74.3% year over year in September, while total unadjusted retail sales increased 9.3%. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce rose 8.1%. Chart 3 Retail e-commerce increases in September Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advanced estimate for retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are the exact same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruptions. For information regarding cannabis statistics, consult the Cannabis Stats Hub. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type do not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 45411—Electronic Shopping and Mail Order Houses. The second type have a storefront and are commonly referred to as brick-and-mortar retailers. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they too are classified to NAICS 45411. Some common electronic commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current dollar values using consumer price indexes. Real-time tables Real-time tables 20-10-0054-01 and 20-10-0079-01 will be updated soon. Next release Data on retail trade for October will be released on December 18.

Exports of goods $46.8 billion November 2020 0.5% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. Goods trade balance -$3.3 billion November 2020 Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. In November, Canada's merchandise exports increased 0.5%, with gold exports posting the largest increase. Imports edged down 0.3%, on lower imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts. As a result, Canada's merchandise trade deficit with the world narrowed from $3.7 billion in October, to $3.3 billion in November. Chart 1 Merchandise exports and imports Following a number of significant increases and decreases earlier in the year, the rate of change in Canada's trade activity slowed in November, with total trade edging up 0.1%. This represented the smallest monthly percentage change in 2020. To explore the most recent results from Canada's international merchandise trade in an interactive format, see the ""International merchandise trade monthly interactive dashboard."" Exports of gold to the United Kingdom surge Total exports were up 0.5% in November to $46.8 billion—$1.5 billion below the pre-COVID-19-pandemic mark set in February. Despite this growth, 7 out of 11 product sections posted declines. Non-energy exports increased 0.2% to $39.9 billion, $129 million shy of their February levels. In real (or volume) terms, total exports rose 0.9%. Chart 2 Contribution to the monthly change in exports, by product, November 2020 Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products increased 11.6% in November, mainly on higher exports of unwrought gold, silver and platinum group metals, and their alloys (+25.8%). Increased exports of refined gold to the United Kingdom were behind this surge, resulting from a rise in sales of cast gold bullion bars, as well as higher transfers of gold within the banking system. Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals (+26.0%) also rose significantly in November. Increases in exports of copper ores (+84.6%) and iron ores (+26.0%) both contributed strongly to the growth in this product section. Despite the pandemic, market conditions (rising prices, strong foreign demand, and supply issues in other countries) have been advantageous for Canadian producers of copper and iron ores in 2020. These factors contributed to an atypical increase in exports of these commodities in November. So far in 2020, exports of both copper and iron ores have already surpassed their 2019 totals. Chart 3 Canadian exports of iron and copper ores These increases were offset in part by lower exports of motor vehicles and parts (-4.1%). After a 7.2% decrease in October, exports of passenger cars and light trucks (-4.0%) fell again in November. Exports of engines and parts (-4.4%) were also down, coinciding with lower motor vehicle production in the United States. Exports of forestry products and building and packaging materials (-6.2%) also declined in November. This was primarily the result of lower exports of lumber (-11.6%), which were down mainly on lower prices. After months of rising prices that peaked in September, lumber prices stabilized in October and then decreased in November. However, these prices remained significantly higher in November compared with May, when the increase began. Following two months of growth, imports of industrial machinery fall Total imports decreased 0.3% in November to $50.1 billion, which was still above pre-pandemic levels. This was the first decline after five consecutive months of growth. In real (or volume) terms, imports were down 0.7%. Chart 4 Contribution to the monthly change in imports, by product, November 2020 Imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts decreased 3.9% in November to $5.3 billion—the second decline in seven months. Since the 21.3% decrease in April, imports of industrial machinery and equipment have increased 28.0%. The decrease in imports of other general-purpose machinery and equipment (-6.8%) contributed the most to the decline this month. In October, high-value shipments of wind turbines from China related to a new wind farm project were observed. These shipments were not repeated in November. Chart 5 Canadian imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts Imports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals decreased 11.0% in November. Despite the monthly decline, imports of this product section were already up by 5.9% in 2020 compared with the full year of 2019. Both the monthly decrease and annual growth were attributable primarily to imports of other metal ores and concentrates—a category composed largely of gold for refining purposes. This month's decrease in imports of other metal ores and concentrates (-23.2%) was mainly the result of lower imports of gold from Peru. These decreases were partially offset by higher imports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts (+16.2%). Imports of aircraft led the increase, in part because of two new airliners imported from Ireland. Imports of aircraft have been affected heavily by the pandemic. So far in 2020, the value of these imports has decreased 39.0% compared with the same period in 2019—a year affected by supply issues resulting from the grounding of some airliners. Exports to non-US countries reach a record on higher exports of gold The divergent trend between Canada's trade with the United States versus Canada's trade with other countries continued in November. Total trade with countries other than the United States was up 2.1% in November, reaching a record $33.1 billion. Total trade with the United States decreased 1.0% to $63.8 billion—the lowest level since June. While total trade with countries other than the United States was up $3.4 billion in November compared with February, total trade with the United States was $4.8 billion below the levels observed that month. A significant part of that gap is the result of lower exports and imports of energy products. In November, exports to countries other than the United States rose 7.4%, a sixth increase in the last seven months. The United Kingdom was by far the largest contributor to the growth in Canada's exports to non-US countries—the result of higher exports of refined gold. Imports from countries other than the United States were down 1.3% in November. Imports from Peru, South Korea and Germany saw the largest decreases. After reaching a record high in October, imports from China remained high, despite falling 2.1% on lower imports of wind turbines. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States narrowed from $6.9 billion in October to $5.7 billion in November. Exports to the United States fell 2.2% in November, while imports edged up 0.3%. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States narrowed from $3.1 billion in October to $2.3 billion in November. Chart 6 Canada's imports and exports with the United States and countries other than the United States When the average exchange rates of October and November are compared, the Canadian dollar gained 0.8 cents US relative to the American dollar, reaching its highest level (76.5 cents US) since October 2018. Chart 7 International merchandise trade balance Revisions to October merchandise exports and imports data Imports in October, originally reported as $50.2 billion in the previous release, were revised to $50.3 billion in the current month's release. Exports in October, originally reported at $46.5 billion in the previous release, were essentially unchanged in the current month's release. Trade in medical and protective goods Following two consecutive monthly declines, imports of medical and protective goods increased 6.7% in November to $3.3 billion on a customs basis. Higher imports of diagnostic products (+35.4%) and medical equipment and products (+8.8%) were moderated by lower imports of personal protective equipment (-8.9%) and disinfectant and sterilization products (-14.8%). Year over year, imports of medical and protective goods were up 46.3%. Meanwhile, exports of medical and protective goods decreased 8.3% to $1.4 billion in November because of lower exports of medical equipment and products (-8.9%). Much of the monthly fluctuation in imports of diagnostic products, as well as imports and exports of medical equipment and products, resulted from variations in trade unrelated to COVID-19. Monthly trade in services In November, monthly service exports were up 1.0% to $9.4 billion, and service imports edged down 0.1% to $9.3 billion. When international trade in goods and services are combined, exports increased 0.6% to $56.2 billion in November, while imports fell 0.3% to $59.4 billion. As a result, Canada's trade deficit with the world for goods and services combined was $3.2 billion in November. Table 1 Merchandise trade: Canada's 10 principal trading partners – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 2 Merchandise trade: North American Product Classification System – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 3 Canada's international trade in goods and services – Balance of payment basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Note to readers Merchandise trade is one component of Canada's international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes trade in services, investment income, current transfers, and capital and financial flows. International trade data by commodity are available on both a BOP and customs basis. International trade data by country are available on a customs basis for all countries, and on a BOP basis for Canada's 27 principal trading partners (PTPs). The list of PTPs is based on their annual share of total merchandise trade—imports and exports—with Canada in 2012. BOP data are derived from customs data by adjusting for factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions of the Canadian System of National Accounts. For a conceptual analysis of BOP-based data versus customs-based data, see ""Balance of Payments trade in goods at Statistics Canada: Expanding geographic detail to 27 principal trading partners."" For more information on these and other macroeconomic concepts, see the Methodological Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-607-X) and the User Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-606-G). The data in this release are on a BOP basis and are seasonally adjusted. Unless otherwise stated, values are expressed in nominal terms, or current dollars. References to prices are based on aggregate Paasche (current-weighted) price indexes (2012=100). Movements within aggregate Paasche prices can be influenced by changes in the share of values traded for specific goods, with sudden shifts in trading patterns—as observed currently with the pandemic—sometimes resulting in large movements in Paasche price indexes. Volumes, or constant dollars, are calculated using the Laspeyres formula (2012=100), unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Revisions In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current-year revisions are reflected in both the customs-based and BOP-based data. The previous year's customs-based data are revised with the release of data for the January and February reference months, and thereafter on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs-based data are revised annually, and revisions are released in February with the December reference month. The previous year's BOP-based data are revised with the release of data for the January, February, March and April reference months. To remain consistent with the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts, revisions to BOP-based data for previous years are released annually in December with the October reference month. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of import and export documentation, incorrect information on customs forms, the replacement of estimates produced for the energy section with actual figures, changes in merchandise classification based on more current information, and changes to seasonal adjustment factors. For information on data revisions for exports of energy products, see Methodology for Exports of Energy Products within the International Merchandise Trade Program. Revised data are available in the appropriate tables. Real-time data table The real-time data table 12-10-0120-01 will be updated on January 18. Next release Data on Canadian international merchandise trade for December 2020 will be released on February 5, 2021.

Gains were mostly observed among medium- and large-sized enterprises. The number of exporters with 50 or more employees grew by 1.0%, while the number of those with fewer than 50 employees edged up 0.1%. Although the value of exports to the United States went up in October (+2.0%) on a balance of payments basis, fewer enterprises exported to this destination (-0.7%), the first decline since April. By contrast, the number of firms exporting to the United Kingdom, one of Canada's most important trading partners, was up by 8.2% as a result of more manufacturing exporters. More firms also exported to China and India. The number of exporters increases in all Atlantic provinces The number of exporting establishments rose in October for a sixth consecutive month, up by 0.7% to 21,440 firms. An enterprise can have multiple establishments located in different provinces or territories and operating in various industries. Therefore, growth in exporting establishments can differ from growth in exporting enterprises. Each of the Atlantic provinces posted a month-over-month increase in exporting establishments in October. Except for Nova Scotia, all Atlantic provinces had more exporters than before the pandemic, led by New Brunswick, up 8.8% compared with February. Saint John, New Brunswick, was the only census metropolitan area in Canada to record an increase in exporters between October 2019 and October 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Elsewhere in Canada, the number of exporting establishments in Alberta rose 8.1% in October on a month-over-month basis, as a result of more manufacturing and wholesale trade exporters. Alberta added more exporters in October (+138) than it added from May to September (+131). Nonetheless, the province's number of exporters was down 5.8% from February. At the same time, the number of exporters also increased in Ontario (+127) and British Columbia (+47), while it fell in Quebec (-110) on a month-over-month basis. The number of exporters in all three provinces was still below pre-pandemic levels. Chart 1 Number of exporting establishments by selected province or region, selected months between February and October 2020 Number of exporters in transportation and warehousing reaches highest level in 2020 From September to October, the three sectors with the largest increase in the number of exporting establishments were manufacturing (+82); professional, scientific and technical services (+33); and transportation and warehousing (+30). While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted exporters in the services-producing sector more severely than those in the goods-producing sector, several service industries, including transportation and warehousing (+10.9%) and finance and insurance (+9.1%), were above their pre-pandemic (February) level of exporters in October. Chart 2 Change in number of exporting establishments, by selected sector, February to September 2020 and September to October 2020 Fewer Canadian establishments export aluminum to the United States, more to China and India Aluminum is a multi-purpose metal present in our day-to-day lives, and it is important for Canada's export activity and the economy as a whole. Canadian aluminum production is a multi-billion dollar business that employs a significant number of workers in the country. In 2019, Canada exported $11.0 billion worth of aluminum products. The United States is, by far, the primary destination for Canadian aluminum exports. Among all aluminum exporters in October 2020, most establishments sold to the US market (717). However, in the pandemic context, this number was down from 775 establishments in October 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). This summer, the United States temporarily placed tariffs on Canadian aluminum exports, specifically on non-alloyed unwrought aluminum. In terms of value, non-alloyed unwrought aluminum is one of Canada's most significant aluminum export products. In October 2020, 16 establishments exported this product to the United States at an average monthly export value of $12.6 million per firm, compared with 19 establishments at an average value of $19.4 million in October 2019. After the United States, the next two destinations with the most aluminum-exporting establishments in October 2020 were China (35) and India (31). Unlike the United States, the number of establishments exporting aluminum to China and India was up slightly compared with October 2019. China is the world's largest consumer and producer of primary aluminum and has shown strong demand this year for aluminum from overseas countries. Note to readers Seasonal adjustment With this release, the monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics program incorporates data that have been seasonally adjusted to track the impacts of COVID-19 on Canadian exporters on a month-to-month basis. Seasonal adjustment techniques that remove the effect of seasonal and calendar influences from the original data can sharpen the extent to which a time series can be used to evaluate meaningful changes in economic conditions over time. Seasonally adjusted data are available at aggregated levels such as the number of exporters by province, by major country of destination, by enterprise employment size, etc. For more detailed information such as the number of exporters at the industry level by province, data are available on an unadjusted basis only. The analysis in this text, unless stated otherwise, is conducted using seasonally adjusted data. For more information on seasonal adjustment, consult Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The term major trading partners refers to Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States, Brazil, Japan, China and India. These countries represent a subset of the countries defined as Canada's principal trading partners as per the Canadian International Merchandise Trade program and the Balance of International Payments program and are among those that have been the most impacted by COVID-19 in terms of confirmed cases. Methodology The monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics release is a special product that is being published specifically to provide Canadians with timely information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian exporters. Seasonally adjusted data are available from January 2019 to October 2020 at aggregated levels only. For more detailed levels, data are available from January 2019 to October 2020 on a customs basis and unadjusted for seasonal variation. Monthly data for reference year 2019 are derived from the annual production database, while data for January to October 2020 are newly developed based on a similar linkage methodology used for the annual Trade by Exporter Characteristics – Goods (TEC–Goods) program. Prior to January 2020, data on exports to non-US destinations were collected by Statistics Canada. In January 2020, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) began collecting non-US export data and transmitting them to Statistics Canada on a daily basis. Exporters were gradually transitioned to the CBSA collection system, and collection by Statistics Canada was phased out completely later in 2020. Data collection remains unchanged for exports to the United States; the US Census Bureau collects and transmits the data to Statistics Canada each month under the terms of the Canada–US data exchange. Overall, a very similar linkage methodology is applied to this 22-month monthly time series as to the annual data, ensuring that consistency between monthly and annual data is maintained. For each month from January 2019 to October 2020, the total number of identified exporters accounted for 99% of the total domestic export value. The number of exporters corresponds to the number of exporters identified in the Business Register (2020). The total value of exports refers to all transactions that can be linked from the monthly domestic exports (customs basis) database. In this release, data disseminated at the provincial level are conceptually different from customs-based merchandise export data. Provincial data for the TEC–Goods program are based on the province where the exporters are located. Goods can be shipped to other provinces for final consumption or can be shipped from other provinces when leaving Canada. Customs-based merchandise exports are based on the province of origin, which is the province in which the goods are grown, produced, extracted or manufactured. Monthly domestic export (customs basis) data can be obtained from Canadian International Merchandise Trade (Customs Basis). Data availability Unadjusted and seasonally adjusted data on monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics are available upon request.

Raw Materials Price Index, excluding crude energy products November 2020 -0.2% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 18-10-0268-01. Prices for products manufactured in Canada, as measured by the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI), fell 0.6% in November, driven mainly by lower prices for lumber and other wood products. Prices of raw materials purchased by manufacturers operating in Canada, as measured by the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI), increased 0.6%, mostly because of higher prices for crude energy products and crop products. Chart 1 Prices for industrial products decrease Industrial Product Price Index In November, the IPPI fell 0.6% month over month. Of the 21 major commodity groups, 9 were down, 9 were up, and 3 were unchanged. The largest downward contributor to the monthly decline was the lumber and other wood products (-10.7%), driven mostly by a steep drop in the price of softwood lumber (-21.2%)—the largest monthly decrease on record. The price of softwood lumber exhibited a correction in October and November, after increasing dramatically (+95.9%) from April to September. In spite of the decline, softwood lumber prices in November were 34.4% higher than in November 2019. Prices for meat, fish and dairy products fell 1.6% in November, mostly as a result of a 15.1% decrease in prices for fresh and frozen pork. Also within the category, prices for fresh and frozen beef and veal increased 5.7%. Energy and petroleum product prices were up 4.0%. The rise was mostly due to an 8.2% increase in the price of diesel and biodiesel fuels; prices for these products were nonetheless down 32.8% on a year-over-year basis. Prices for light fuel oils rose 9.4%, and motor gasoline prices (+0.4%) were also up. The increase in diesel was attributable to seasonal demand for heating fuel, to demand from transportation, as well as to a rise in the price of crude oil. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average weekly amount of distillate fuel oil supplied (which includes diesel fuel and light fuel oils) was 3.4% higher in November than in the previous month, yet 3.8% lower when compared with the same month last year. On a year-over-year basis, the IPPI was flat in November. Lower energy and petroleum product prices (-28.6%) were offset by higher prices for primary non-ferrous metals (+21.0%), and lumber and other wood products (+23.2%). Raw Materials Price Index The RMPI increased 0.6% in November. Of the six major commodity groups, three were up and three were down. The increase in the RMPI was driven mainly by gains in crude energy products and crop products. Prices for crude energy products rose 2.6%. Within the group, conventional crude oil (+1.7%), natural gas (+6.8%) and synthetic crude oil (+2.2%) recorded price gains. Higher prices for natural gas were partly attributable to supply pressures caused by a decline in shale oil production, as these two products are often extracted in conjunction. The price of crop products rose 3.2% in November, mostly because of higher prices for canola (+5.9%). This was the ninth consecutive monthly increase of canola prices. In 2020, Canadian canola yield per hectare and total production were at their lowest levels since 2015. The monthly gain in the RMPI was moderated by decreases in prices for metal ores, concentrates, and scrap (-1.0%), as well as for animals and animal products (-1.5%). On a year-over-year basis, the RMPI fell 1.7%, mostly as a result of lower prices for crude energy products (-26.5%). This decline was offset by a 27.0% increase in prices for metal ores, concentrates, and scrap. Chart 2 Prices for raw materials increase Table 1 Industrial Product Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Table 2 Raw Materials Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Note to readers The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) and the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) are available at the Canada level only. Selected commodity groups within the IPPI are also available by region. With each release, data for the previous six months may have been revised. The indexes are not seasonally adjusted. The Industrial Product Price Index reflects the prices that producers in Canada receive as goods leave the plant gate. The IPPI does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike the Consumer Price Index, the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and all costs that occur between the time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user takes possession of the good. This includes transportation, wholesale, and retail costs. Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars, and these prices are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp and paper products, and wood products. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US counterpart affect the IPPI. However, the conversion to Canadian dollars reflects only how respondents provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes into account the full effect of exchange rates. The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on the average monthly exchange rate established by the Bank of Canada and available in table 33-10-0163-01 (series v111666275). Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example, CAN$1 = US$X). The Raw Materials Price Index reflects the prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI. Basket update and methodology changes Starting with the October 2020 reference period, the IPPI and RMPI are using an updated basket and methodology. The indexes have been converted from 2010 = 100 to January 2020 = 100 and also updated to use a weighting pattern based on the 2016 production values of Canadian manufacturers. At the same time, the IPPI and RMPI have been modernized with the adoption of a weighted geometric (Jevons) formula and incorporation of parental imputation as the default imputation methodology for missing price quotes. The IPPI and RMPI are now using the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) Canada 2017 version 2.0 and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Canada 2017 version 3.0. Products Statistics Canada launched the Producer price indexes portal as part of a suite of portals for prices and price indexes. This web page provides Canadians with a single point of access to a variety of statistics and measures related to producer prices. The video ""Producer Price Indexes"" is available on the Statistics Canada Training Institute webpage. It provides an introduction to Statistics Canada's producer price indexes—what they are, how they are made and what they are used for. Next release The industrial product and raw materials price indexes for December will be released on January 29, 2021.

Proportion of population living in a census metropolitan area 71.8% July 1, 2020 0.1 pt (annual change) Source(s): Table 17-10-0135-01. Population growth in Canada's large urban regions slows, but still outpaces that of other regions In most large urban regions (census metropolitan areas [CMAs]) in the country, population growth slowed from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020, compared with the same period a year earlier (+1.3% compared with +1.7%). However, the long-term trend of urbanization continued over that period, as the other regions of the country grew at a lower rate (+0.6%). On July 1, 2020, 27.3 million people, or just over 7 in 10 Canadians (71.8%) lived in a CMA. Despite lower international migration (permanent and temporary) due to travel restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19, international migration accounted for the vast majority (90.3%) of the growth in CMAs from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. In comparison, it accounted for just over one-third of the population growth in other regions of the country. Chart 1 Population growth rate by census metropolitan area, 2019/2020, Canada Excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 has had a limited impact on the slowing population growth in urban centres, despite urban centres being the epicentres of the pandemic. In the CMA of Montréal (+0.7%), for example, net international migration declined by over 23,000 from 2018/2019 levels, falling from 72,827 to 49,729. This decrease widely exceeded the number of COVID-19-related deaths in the CMA of Montréal, even though the region recorded the most COVID-19-related deaths nationally during the first wave of the pandemic. The CMA of Oshawa (+2.1%) recorded the fastest growing population, followed by the CMAs of Halifax and Kitchener–Cambridge–Waterloo (both up 2.0%) and Kelowna, Calgary and Saskatoon (all three up 1.9%). Urban sprawl continues, with Toronto and Montréal both experiencing record-high population losses to surrounding areas More people are opting to live outside of Canada's largest urban centres, which is contributing to ongoing urban sprawl. Despite still showing overall positive population growth, mostly due to international migration, the CMAs of Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver continued to see more people moving out to other regions of their province rather than moving in. From July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020, the CMAs of Toronto (-50,375) and Montréal (-24,880) each posted a record loss of people as a result of these population exchanges. In Toronto, the net loss was mainly driven by people moving to surrounding CMAs. For example, the population growth in Oshawa (+2.1%)—which posted the fastest growth—was partly due to migration flows from the neighbouring CMA of Toronto. High population growth rates in municipalities located close to the Montréal CMA, like Farnham (+5.2%) and Saint-Hippolyte (+4.1%), were also partly due to migratory flows coming from the Montréal CMA. Urban sprawl continued within Canada's three largest CMAs, with the fastest growing municipalities more often found in suburban areas. For example, the municipalities of Milton (+4.0%) and Brampton (+3.4%) grew at the fastest pace among those within the Toronto CMA (+1.4%). Similarly, the municipalities of Mirabel (+3.6%) and New Westminster (+2.8%) were among the fastest growing in the CMAs of Montréal (+0.7%) and Vancouver (+1.1%), respectively. The desire to live outside the largest urban centres was also reflected in the rapidly increasing housing costs in neighbouring real estate markets, a trend that has continued in spite of the pandemic. Personal health, the ability to work remotely, and higher housing costs are among the most important factors contributing to the decision of many Canadians to continue (or to no longer continue) living in large urban centres hardest hit by the pandemic. Whatever the exact reasons, urban sprawl is an important trend to monitor. Chart 2 Distribution of population by age group and census metropolitan area, Canada, July 1, 2020 Table 1 Annual population estimates by census metropolitan area, July 1, 2020 Note to readers This release focuses mainly on preliminary postcensal population estimates for census metropolitan areas by age and sex as of July 1, 2020. Revised estimates as of July 1, for the years 2017 to 2019, are also available. Population estimates are also released for census agglomerations, census divisions, census subdivisions and economic regions. See the Tables tab for more information. Historical analysis of net intraprovincial migration is based on data for the years 2001/2002 to 2019/2020, inclusively. This period represents the extent to which comparable intraprovincial migration estimates are available. This analysis is based on preliminary data. These data will be revised over the coming year, and it is possible that some trends described in this study will change as a result of these revisions. Therefore, this analysis should be interpreted with caution. The estimates released today are based on 2016 Census counts, adjusted for census net undercoverage and incompletely enumerated Indian reserves, to which are added the population growth estimates for the period from May 10, 2016, to the date of the estimate. These estimates are based on the 2016 Standard Geographical Classification. The annual period of reference comprises the period of July 1 of a certain year to July 1 of the following year. Therefore, 2019/2020 refers to the period from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. For the purpose of calculating rates, the denominator is the average population during the period (the average of the start-of-period and end-of-period populations). For the sake of brevity, the terms growth, population growth and population growth rate have the same meaning. A rate higher than -0.1% and lower than 0.1% is considered not significant. A census metropolitan area is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre (known as the core). A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000, of which 50,000 or more must live in the core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from census place of work data. Census subdivision is the general term for municipalities (as determined by provincial/territorial legislation) or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes (e.g., Indian reserves, Indian settlements and unorganized territories). For the sake of brevity, the terms census subdivision and municipality have the same meaning.

Excluding energy and petroleum products, the IPPI rose 0.9%. The gain in the IPPI was led mainly by higher prices for lumber and other wood products (+10.8%), particularly softwood lumber (+21.7%). This increase comes after two months of decline in October and November, following record and near-record increases from July to September. Prices for energy and petroleum products (+7.9%) also contributed significantly to the increase in the IPPI, particularly refined petroleum energy products (+9.2%) such as diesel and biodiesel fuels (+10.1%) and motor gasoline (+7.7%). Prices for primary non-ferrous metal products (+3.1%) also supported the IPPI's growth, led mainly by higher prices for unwrought aluminum and aluminum alloys (+8.1%) and unwrought copper and copper alloys (+7.6%). Prices for chemicals and chemical products (+2.2%) also posted an increase in December. Prices for meat, fish and dairy products (-3.4%) declined in December, led mainly by decreased prices for fresh and frozen beef and veal (-11.3%), as well as for fresh and frozen pork (-8.4%). Year over year, the IPPI increased 1.5%. Excluding energy and petroleum products, the IPPI rose 4.4% year over year. Chart 1 Industrial Product Price Index (January 2018 to December 2020) Chart 2 Softwood lumber (January 2018 to December 2020) Table 1 Industrial Product Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Note to readers To provide Canadians with timely economic data, Statistics Canada is releasing early estimates of the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) for December 2020. These are referred to as flash estimates and are subject to revision when the index is officially released on January 29, 2021. Because flash estimates are calculated using preliminary data, these values should be used with caution. Basket update and methodology changes Starting with the October 2020 reference period, the IPPI and Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) are using an updated basket and methodology. The indexes have been converted from 2010 = 100 to January 2020 = 100 and also updated to use a weighting pattern based on the 2016 production values of Canadian manufacturers. At the same time, the IPPI and RMPI have been modernized with the adoption of a weighted geometric (Jevons) formula and the incorporation of parental imputation as the default imputation methodology for missing price quotes. The IPPI and RMPI are now using the North American Product Classification System Canada 2017 version 2.0 and the North American Industry Classification System Canada 2017 version 3.0.

Statistics Canada has adapted to these changes in spending habits by developing the adjusted price index in partnership with the Bank of Canada. The adjusted price index takes into account these sudden shifts in spending patterns when weighing the components that make up the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Consumer price inflation during the pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has led to economic disruptions that have affected financial and labour markets across the globe. Very quickly, Canadians began spending differently as they adapted to staying home, travelling less, and buying more of certain items and less of others. Some businesses reopened over the summer as physical distancing measures were eased, starting with the most essential services. Although some consumer spending patterns began returning to the way they were before the pandemic, many remained altered over the fall period. Shifts in household purchasing patterns have implications for the basket weights used to measure consumer price inflation. A fixed-basket price index, such as the official Consumer Price Index, can only reflect such changes when basket weights are updated. In partnership with the Bank of Canada, Statistics Canada obtained temporary access to aggregate data on recent expenditures representing the majority of consumer goods and services. These data reflect the new consumption patterns during the pandemic and were used, along with other available alternative data sources, to derive the monthly adjusted basket weights used to calculate the adjusted price index. This adjusted series provides an alternative estimate of consumer price inflation during the pandemic. Canadians direct more of their spending to food and less to transportation In October, the monthly adjusted weights for consumer expenditures remained closely aligned with the 2017 basket weights for most of the major components. As new restrictions were introduced in the fall to limit the impact of the COVID-19 resurgence, the share of consumer spending on food edged up, while consumers allocated less money to transportation and clothing compared with July. The adjusted weight for the recreation, education and reading component remained low in October relative to the official CPI basket weight because a lower share of expenditures were directed to travel services, as the US–Canada border remained closed and restrictions discouraged domestic travel. The adjusted basket weight for the household operations, furnishings and equipment component remained elevated in October as Canadians dedicated a larger proportion of spending to financial services and other household services. The adjusted weights for household durable goods, including furniture, household appliances, and tools and other household equipment, as well as non-electric kitchen utensils, tableware and cookware, edged up as consumer spending on durable goods rose at a record pace in the third quarter of 2020. Infographic 1 CPI) and the adjusted price index, Canada, February 2020 to October 2020"" /> Basket weights of major components in the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the adjusted price index, Canada, February 2020 to October 2020 CPI) and the adjusted price index, Canada, February 2020 to October 2020"" /> The gap between the adjusted price index and the official CPI widened in September, corresponding with the increase in COVID-19 cases that marked a resurgence of the pandemic. Higher food prices, particularly for meat and vegetables, in October and November became more important in the adjusted price index, contributing to the gap between the adjusted price index and the official CPI. At the same time, transportation prices became less important in the adjusted price index, reflecting reduced air travel and low domestic and international demand for gasoline amid the tightening of public health restrictions. As a result of the food and transportation components, the adjusted price index remained higher than the official CPI in September, October and November. In November, the adjusted price index rose 1.4% on a year-over-year basis, while the official CPI increased 1.0%. Chart 1 Official Consumer Price Index (CPI) and adjusted price index, Canada, February 2020 to November 2020 In November, the air transportation index was the largest contributor to the difference between the one-month changes in the two indexes. While many flights remained cancelled or suspended as a result of the pandemic, airlines continued to offer incentives, including reduced fees, discounts and promotions, to encourage Canadians to resume travelling. These lower prices for air transportation became less important in the adjusted price index. The change in annual average CPI, which is used by most programs employing the CPI for indexation purposes, measures the change in the annual average of the CPI between 12-month periods. The change in annual average CPI for the 12-month period ending in November 2020, compared with the 12-month period ending in November 2019, was 1.1% for the adjusted price index, compared with 0.9% for the official CPI. Table 1 Adjusted consumer expenditure basket weights for the months of February to October 2020 Table 2 One-month and 12-month change in the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the adjusted price index Note to readers The adjusted price index is experimental and should not be used instead of the official measure of consumer price inflation. The official Consumer Price Index (CPI) is based on a fixed basket that aligns with international best practices. It should be noted that there is no clear indication yet how long consumer expenditure patterns will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequent updates to the CPI basket of goods and services to account for consumption changes, in the absence of a robust and detailed source of expenditure data, would compromise the accuracy of the index values. As the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the consumption patterns of Canadian households is ongoing, Statistics Canada continues to examine complementary measures of inflation that reflect price change as experienced by Canadians. The adjusted price index, introduced as a temporary measure at the onset of the pandemic, has proven useful to supplement the official measure of consumer price inflation. Now that the economic effects of the pandemic have endured for some time, Statistics Canada will continue to monitor consumer behaviours and expenditures in preparation for the next CPI basket update, which is currently planned for July 2021. Products The analytical papers Consumer expenditures during COVID-19: An exploratory analysis of the effects of changing consumption patterns on consumer price indexes and Adjusting the Consumer Price Index to the new spending realities during the pandemic provide detailed information on the data and methods used to calculate the adjusted price index series, as well as on the adjusted weights reflecting consumer spending. The data table for the adjusted price index now includes data for September, October and November 2020, as well as revised data for prior months. The data table for the monthly adjusted consumer expenditure basket weights now includes data for August, September and October 2020, as well as revised data for prior months.

Total investment in building construction declined for a third consecutive month, edging down 0.1% to $15.3 billion in November. Slight decreases in both residential and non-residential construction led to minimal change overall. Gains in Ontario and Nova Scotia were offset in large part by declines in six provinces. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction decreased 0.3% to $12.4 billion in November. For more information on housing, please visit the Housing Statistics Portal. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Non-residential investment unchanged Non-residential investment was mostly unchanged in November, remaining at $4.4 billion. Slight declines in six provinces were offset by small gains in Ontario (+0.4% to $1.8 billion) and British Columbia (+1.0% to $665 million). As lockdowns and working from home continued across many parts of the country, reduced investment in office buildings, hotels and restaurants led to an overall reduction in commercial building investment (-0.5%). Commercial building investment was the lone component of non-residential construction to decline in November and remained below pre-COVID-19 levels (-13.5% compared with March 2020). Investment in industrial building construction increased 0.6% in November, with the majority of the growth in Ontario (+1.7% to $339 million) and Quebec (+1.5% to $215 million). The increases reported in Ontario were attributable primarily to the construction of the $100 million Metrolinx Keelesdale transit station in the city of Toronto. Institutional building investment advanced 0.4%—the first increase in this component following four months of declines. The majority of the growth was reported in Alberta (+2.6%) and British Columbia (+1.5%), stemming from new construction of educational buildings in both provinces and welfare homes in British Columbia. Infographic 1 Investment in non-residential building construction, November 2020 Residential construction declines slightly Investment in residential construction edged down 0.1% in November, declining for the first time in six months. Lower investment in multi-unit dwellings more than offset the growth reported for single-unit investment. Provincially, Manitoba reported the largest decline (-7.8% to $402 million), followed by Quebec (-1.1% to $2.3 billion). Meanwhile, Nova Scotia reached its second-highest value on record, up 15.2% to $271 million. Despite the exceptional COVID-19-related decline in April 2020, year-over-year investment in single-unit buildings increased 9.4%. In November, single-unit investment was up 2.1% to $5.6 billion. The construction of new single family homes in Toronto led to an increase of 2.1% in Ontario—the largest increase of all the provinces. Multi-unit construction investment declined for the second consecutive month in November, down 2.2% to $5.2 billion, and offsetting the growth observed in single-unit investment. Manitoba, Quebec, and Alberta reported the largest drops of the five provinces reporting declines in this component. Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in residential building construction, November 2020 Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions around the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Deflated data and seasonally adjusted data are revised for the previous two months. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates for constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarters' price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to structure type Single. Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage. Effective November 23, 2018, table 34-10-0175-01 contains data on both the residential and non-residential sectors. It replaced tables 34-10-0010-01, 34-10-0011-01 and 34-10-0012-01. Next release Data on investment in building construction December 2020 will be released on February 8, 2021.

December Labour Force Survey (LFS) results reflect labour market conditions as of the week of December 6 to 12. As of the reference week, public health measures introduced earlier in the fall remained in place in Manitoba and much of Quebec. These included the closure of many recreation and cultural facilities and in-person dining services, as well as various degrees of restrictions on retail businesses. In several other provinces, new restrictions had been introduced since the November LFS reference week. Nova Scotia introduced targeted measures in the urban core of the Halifax Regional Municipality on November 26. In Ontario, a lockdown was implemented in Toronto and Peel on November 23, which was extended to Windsor and York on December 11. Prince Edward Island entered a two-week shutdown on December 7. In Alberta, targeted measures introduced on November 24 required the closure of many entertainment and recreation facilities, but not in-person dining services. Saskatchewan introduced capacity limits for many businesses and activities on November 27. Additional public health measures implemented in many provinces after the December LFS reference week (December 6 to 12) are likely to be reflected in January Labour Force Survey results. Highlights Employment falls for the first time since April Employment fell by 63,000 (-0.3%) in December—the first decline since April. Part-time employment declined by 99,000 (-2.9%) in December, led by losses among youth aged 15 to 24 (-58,000; -5.1%) and those aged 55 and older (-27,000; -3.0%). By December, 1.1 million Canadian workers were affected by the COVID-19 economic shutdown—in the form of lost employment or reduced hours—compared with 5.5 million in April. Self-employment fell by 62,000 in December, while the number of employees in both the public and private sectors was little changed. As more provinces adapted their public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, total hours worked declined for the first time since April, falling 0.3% in December. As the number of COVID-19 cases increased in the fall, the share of Canadians working from home trended up, reaching 28.6% in December. Unemployment rate holds steady The unemployment rate was 8.6% in December, essentially unchanged from 8.5% in November. In December, the unemployment rate of Canadians aged 15 to 69 who belong to a population group designated as a visible minority was little changed at 9.9% (not seasonally adjusted). The participation rate declined for the second month in a row in December, falling 0.2 percentage points to 64.9%. First employment decline for the services-producing sector since April Employment in the services-producing sector fell by 74,000 (-0.5%) in December—the first decline in the sector since April. Employment decreased in accommodation and food services; other services; and information, culture and recreation industries. All three industries were impacted by public health measures. Although manufacturing employment increased (+15,000; +0.9%), employment in the goods-producing sector as a whole was little changed in December. Labour market conditions vary across provinces, reflecting differences in public health measures Employment declined in Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island and held steady in the other six provinces. Employment matched its pre-COVID February level only in Newfoundland and Labrador and was furthest below its February level in Alberta (-5.4%) and Manitoba (-5.8%). Youth employment falls farther from pre-COVID levels Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 1.1% (-27,000) in December, with losses in part-time employment (-58,000; -5.1%) partially offset by gains in full-time work (+32,000; +2.7%). Employment remained farther from pre-pandemic levels for youth (-10.5%) than for all other demographic groups in December, with female youth (-12.1%) continuing to be harder hit than their male counterparts (-8.8%). Among the core-aged population (25 to 54 years old), both total employment and the unemployment rate were little changed in December. Employment was closer to its pre-COVID level for the core-aged population than for all other age groups, with employment 1.8% below February levels. The unemployment rate for Canadians aged 55 and older rose 0.8 percentage points in December to 7.9%. Over the past several months, employment has remained further below pre-pandemic levels among Indigenous people compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts. This continued in December, with employment among Indigenous Canadians 7.8% below February levels, compared with 2.1% below for non-Indigenous Canadians (not seasonally adjusted). Employment falls for the first time since April Employment fell by 63,000 (-0.3%) in December—the first decline since April. The unemployment rate was 8.6%, little changed from 8.5% in November. Employment fell in industries most directly affected by new and continuing public health measures, including accommodation and food services; ""other services""; and information, culture and recreation. By April, the initial widespread COVID-19 economic shutdown had directly affected 5.5 million Canadian workers, including 3.0 million who had lost their job and 2.5 million who were employed but had experienced COVID-related absences from work. By December, the equivalent figure was 1.1 million, including a 636,000 drop in employment since February and 488,000 more Canadians who were employed but working less than half their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID. Chart 1 Employment declines for the first time since April Part-time employment declines Part-time employment declined by 99,000 (-2.9%) in December, led by losses among youth aged 15 to 24 (-58,000; -5.1%) and those aged 55 and older (-27,000; -3.0%). Compared with 12 months earlier, part-time employment was down 6.3% (-224,000), while full-time employment had decreased by 2.2% (-347,000). Number of self-employed workers at lowest point since February Self-employment fell by 62,000 in December, while the number of employees in both the public and private sectors was little changed. The monthly drop in self-employment more than offset the increase seen over the previous two months and brought the number of self-employed workers to its lowest point since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, or 6.8% (-198,000) lower than in February. In contrast, the number of private-sector employees was 4.1% (-512,000) lower than in February while public sector employment was 1.9% (+73,000) higher. On a year-over-year basis, self-employment was down by 192,000 (-6.6%) in December, with the largest declines in construction; transportation and warehousing; and health care and social assistance (not seasonally adjusted). The bulk of the decline was among core-aged workers, mostly men (not seasonally adjusted). Decreases were observed among the incorporated self-employed—including those with and without paid employees—as well as those who are unincorporated but have employees (not seasonally adjusted). In April 2020, the initial impact of COVID-19 public health measures was reflected in a large number of business closures. While many businesses re-opened over the summer, monthly estimates of business openings and closures showed that the number of active businesses in September was 7.2% lower than in February 2020. The year-over-year decline in the number of self-employed workers with paid employees could be an indication that the number of business closures increased in the fall as some public health measures were reintroduced. Chart 2 Self-employment declines, while growth halts for private sector employees Hours worked fall for the first time since April Along with employment, total hours worked across all industries is a core indicator of the state of the labour market. In general, total hours worked can be influenced by a number of factors such as employment growth, compositional change in employment by industry and occupation, and changes in absences from work. As more provinces adapted their public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 during the second wave of the pandemic, total hours worked declined for the first time since April, falling 0.3% in December. This decline was driven by losses in the accommodation and food services, and the ""other services"" industries (which include personal and laundry services). Smaller declines were observed in business, building and other support services, and natural resources. Prior to December, total hours worked had recovered steadily, following a drop of more than one-quarter (-27.7%) from February to April. In December, total hours worked were 5.3% below February levels, with hours lost by self-employed workers accounting for over two-fifths (44.3%) of the overall decline. Over one-quarter of Canadians working from home in December At the height of the COVID-19 economic shutdown in April, two-fifths (41.6%) of people who worked at least half their usual hours worked from home. As the labour market rebounded during the spring and summer, this proportion fell steadily to 25.6% in September. As the number of COVID-19 cases increased in the fall, the share of Canadians working from home trended upwards and reached 28.6% in December. In general, the proportion of Canadians working from home can be influenced by a number of factors, such as changes in the work location of current jobs, the work location of new hires, and the extent to which employers have been able to adapt their operations to make working from home more practical. The number of Canadians working at locations other than their home fell by about 250,000 to 12.0 million in December, while the number working from home increased by approximately 200,000 to 4.8 million. Among those working from home, 2.8 million reported that they did not usually do so. Chart 3 The proportion of Canadians working from home has trended up since October Unemployment rate holds steady The unemployment rate was 8.6% in December, essentially unchanged from 8.5% in November. The unemployment rate rose from 5.6% in February, just prior to the pandemic, to reach a record high of 13.7% in May in the wake of the first shutdown. Chart 4 Unemployment rate down from May record high Unemployment rate increases for Southeast Asian and Latin American Canadians, declines among South Asians In December, the unemployment rate of Canadians aged 15 to 69 who belong to a population group designated as a visible minority was little changed at 9.9% (not seasonally adjusted). At the same time, the unemployment rate among those who were not Indigenous or a visible minority edged up 0.3 percentage points to 7.2% (not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate among South Asian Canadians declined for the second consecutive month in December (-1.8 percentage points to 8.7%, not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the unemployment rate increased for Southeast Asian (+3.9 percentage points to 12.6%) and Latin American Canadians (+2.1 percentage points to 12.0%). There was little change among the other four largest population groups designated as visible minorities (not seasonally adjusted). Labour force participation declines The labour force—the number of people counted as either employed or unemployed—dropped by 42,000 (-0.2%) in December, the first significant decline since April. Core-aged women and male youth were largely responsible for the fall. The participation rate—the labour force as a proportion of the population aged 15 and older—declined for the second month in a row in December, falling 0.2 percentage points to 64.9%. The decrease was greatest for male youth (-0.9 percentage points to 63.0%), core-aged women (-0.3 percentage points to 83.5%) and core-aged men (-0.2 percentage points to 91.4%). While the participation rate remained higher than the record low of 59.8% in April, it was 0.6 percentage points lower than in February. The December increase in the number of people not in the labour force was entirely due to a rise (+99,000; +1.0%) among those who did not want a job, presumably because they had other responsibilities or interests. The number of people who wanted a job but did not look for one—which is typically an indication of job searchers being discouraged at the prospect of not finding work—declined in December (-35,000; -6.4%). Labour underutilization flat as many Canadians still searching for work or working less than half their usual hours Since March, the labour underutilization rate has served as an overall indicator of the impact of COVID-19 on labour market conditions. Above and beyond the unemployment rate, this rate reflects the proportion of people in the potential labour force who are either unemployed, want a job but have not looked for one, or are employed but working less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19. After surging from 11.2% in February to 36.1% in April at the height of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the labour underutilization rate trended downward from May to November. In December, the rate was virtually unchanged at 17.1%. Job searchers accounted for approximately two-fifths (41.2%) of labour underutilization in December, followed by those who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours (36.4%). Almost one-quarter of labour underutilization was attributable to people who wanted a job but did not look for one (14.3%) and those on temporary layoff or with arrangements to start a job in the near future (8.2%). First employment decline for the services-producing sector since April Employment in the services-producing sector fell by 74,000 (-0.5%) in December—the first decline in the sector since April. Employment decreased in accommodation and food services; ""other services""; and information, culture and recreation industries. All three industries were affected by continuing and enhanced public health measures. Although manufacturing employment increased, employment in the goods-producing sector as a whole was little changed in December. Employment in the services- (-3.5%) and goods-producing (-2.5%) sectors remained below February levels. Employment falls in accommodation and food services for the third straight month Employment in accommodation and food services declined for the third consecutive month, falling by 57,000 (-5.8%) in December from the previous month and down by 129,000 (-12.4%) from September. Month over month, employment fell in six provinces, with the largest declines in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Nationally, employment in accommodation and food services was one-quarter (-25.8%) lower in December than in February. At its recent peak in September, employment in the industry was 15.3% below its pre-pandemic level, while in April, employment was down by half (-50.0%). Sales in food service and drinking places fell 8.9% in October as second-wave COVID restrictions were implemented in several provinces. Chart 5 Employment in accommodation and food services down by one-quarter compared with February Second consecutive employment decline in information, culture and recreation Employment in information, culture and recreation declined for the second straight month, down by 19,000 (-2.7%) in December, as some provinces tightened public health measures at gyms, theaters and other businesses where it is difficult to maintain social distance. Most of the month-over-month employment decrease was in Alberta, where targeted measures were adopted as of November 24. At the national level, employment in information, culture and recreation was 12.9% below February levels. Chart 6 Employment continues to decline in accommodation and food services, and in information, culture and recreation First employment decline in ""other services"" since April Employment in ""other services"" decreased for the first time since April, falling by 31,000 (-4.0%) in December. This industry includes a variety of businesses affected by public health measures, such as personal and laundry services (which include hair and beauty services) and religious activities. Most of the month-over-month decline occurred in Ontario and Quebec. In 2019, almost one-third (29.1%) of people working in ""other services"" were self-employed. In December, employment in ""other services"" was 9.3% below the pre-COVID level in February, but well above the low in April, when employment was down by over one-fifth (-22.7%). Employment little changed for the second consecutive month in health care and social assistance In health care and social assistance, employment was little changed for the second consecutive month in December. Employment in this industry has hovered around its pre-COVID level since October, when the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey found that there were 80,700 vacancies in the industry, second only to retail trade (not seasonally adjusted). Employment edges up in retail trade Employment in retail trade edged up by 19,000 (+0.9%) in December. While this pace of growth was slightly lower than in October (+1.4%) and November (+1.5%), it brought the industry to within 2.9% of its pre-COVID employment level. Retail trade had the highest number of job vacancies (92,800) in October and accounted for one-sixth (17%) of all job vacancies that month (not seasonally adjusted). Retail sales edged up 0.4% in October. Upward trend in employment continues in professional, scientific and technical services Employment in professional, scientific and technical services continued to trend upward, rising by 17,000 (+1.0%) in December. A relatively small share of jobs in this industry—which includes computer system design services and advertising and related services—require close physical proximity to others, limiting the impact of public health measures on the sector. Most of the month-over-month employment increase occurred in Quebec. Nationally, employment in professional, scientific and technical services was 4.8% higher in December than in February. Growth resumes in manufacturing after two months of little change Following two months of little change, manufacturing employment rose by 15,000 (+0.9%) in December, driven by an increase in Ontario. At the national level, the employment level in manufacturing has been hovering around its pre-COVID level since September. COVID-19 public health measures affect provincial labour markets While national employment fell for the first time since April, labour market conditions varied across provinces, reflecting differences in the extent of new and continuing public health restrictions. Employment declined in Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island and held steady in the other six provinces. Employment matched its pre-COVID February level only in Newfoundland and Labrador and was furthest below its February level in Alberta (-5.4%) and Manitoba (-5.8%). For further information on key province-level and industry-level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in Brief: Interactive app."" Employment growth stalls in Central Canada Employment in Ontario was little changed in December, following monthly growth averaging 2.2% from June to November. The unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 9.5% as more people looked for work. Employment losses were greatest in the accommodation and food services industry (-5.9%), while more people were working in manufacturing (+2.1%). After increasing for five consecutive months, employment in the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA) was unchanged in November and fell by 52,000 (-1.5%) in December, coinciding with tighter public health measures adopted in the CMA on November 14 and a fuller lockdown implemented on November 23. Given tighter public health measures in place since early October, employment in Quebec was little changed for the third consecutive month. With fewer people looking for work, the unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 6.7%—the lowest among the provinces. Employment increased in professional, scientific and technical services, while there were fewer workers in health care and social assistance, as well as in ""other services."" Following little change in October and November, fewer people (-32,000; -1.5%) worked in the Montréal CMA in December as COVID-19 red zone restrictions remained in place during the week of December 6 to 12. Employment losses in Saskatchewan and Manitoba In Saskatchewan, employment fell by 6,700 (-1.2%) in December, led by losses in full-time work, and the unemployment rate increased 0.9 percentage points to 7.8%. In Manitoba, employment decreased by 6,600 (-1.0%), adding to losses of 18,000 (-2.8%) in November, and the unemployment rate ended the year at 8.2%, up from 7.4% in November. Employment in Alberta was little changed for the second consecutive month, following average growth of 2.1% from May to October. The unemployment rate was 11.0%, little changed from November, but up from the pre-pandemic rate of 7.2% in February. Employment declines were most notable in information, culture and recreation; construction; and accommodation and food services, while more people were working in business, building and other support services. Employment in British Columbia was little changed in December, as gains in full-time employment were offset by losses in part-time work, while the unemployment rate was 7.2%. The largest employment losses in the month were in accommodation and food services, while the largest gains were in construction. The Vancouver CMA saw little employment change in December, following gains averaging 2.8% from June to November. Fewer people working in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island Employment in Nova Scotia fell by 9,600 (-2.0%) and by 900 in Prince Edward Island in December. Both Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick posted little employment change in the month. No employment losses in the territories The LFS collects labour market data in the territories produced in the form of three-month moving averages. Employment in Yukon rose by an estimated 800 people in the fourth quarter, and the employment rate—employment as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older—increased 2.4 percentage points to 67.4%. The unemployment rate fell 1.1 percentage points to 5.1%. Following little change in the third quarter, employment in the Northwest Territories increased by 1,300 in the fourth quarter and the employment rate increased 3.9 percentage points to 65.6%. The unemployment rate dropped by 3.3 percentage points to 6.1%. Employment in Nunavut held steady in the fourth quarter. Youth employment falls farther from pre-COVID levels Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 1.1% (-27,000) in December, with losses in part-time employment (-58,000; -5.1%) partially offset by gains in full-time work (+32,000; +2.7%). These changes were primarily driven by female youth, with both full-time and part-time work being little changed for male youth. The youth unemployment rate was 17.7% in December, virtually unchanged from November. The labour force participation rate fell by 0.9 percentage points to 63.0% for young men and was little changed at 63.3% for female youth. Employment remained farther from pre-pandemic levels for youth (-10.5%) than for all other demographic groups in December, with female youth (-12.1%) continuing to be harder hit than their male counterparts (-8.8%). There were 247,000 fewer youth employed in December 2020 than 12 months earlier, including 153,000 young women and 94,000 young men (not seasonally adjusted) The accommodation and food services industry accounted for over three-fifths (-152,000) of the net year-over-year drop in youth employment. Chart 7 Employment recovery for youth falters in December Employment for core-aged population remains closest to pre-shutdown levels Among the core-aged population (25 to 54 years old), total employment was little changed for both men and women in December. Despite the stability in the month, employment was closer to its pre-COVID level for the core-aged population than for all other age groups, with employment 1.8% below February levels. The unemployment rate for the core-aged population was little changed from November, at 7.0%. There were approximately 44,000 (-0.3%) fewer core-aged people in the labour force in December compared with November, mainly driven by a decline among women (-27,000; -0.4%). The participation rate declined for both women (-0.3 percentage points to 83.5%) and men (-0.2 percentage points to 91.4%). Unemployment increases for Canadians aged 55 and older Total employment was little changed for older workers in December, despite part-time employment being down 27,000 (-3.0%) from November. Employment for this group was 3.4% below February levels, with employment 2.6% below pre-pandemic levels for older men and 4.4% below for older women. The unemployment rate for Canadians aged 55 and older rose 0.8 percentage points in December to 7.9%. Unemployment for this group grew at a faster pace among women (+24,000; +18.7%) than among men (+10,000; +5.6%). Chart 8 Unemployment rate up for all age groups, highest among youth Like other youth, younger recent immigrants face labour market challenges In recent months, the employment rate—that is, the percentage of the population that is employed—has been closer to pre-pandemic levels among immigrants who landed within the past five years than among more established immigrants and those born in Canada (not seasonally adjusted). This reflects the fact that declines in employment for this group have coincided with a decline in the number of new immigrants, a direct result of COVID-related international travel restrictions. This pattern continued in December. Using three-month moving averages, which help smooth out monthly variations for smaller population groups, the employment rate among immigrants who landed within the past five years was little changed from the same three-month period a year earlier (65.4%, not seasonally adjusted) as their population and employment levels fell at a similar pace. In contrast, the three-month moving average employment rate declined for immigrants who landed over five years ago (-2.3 percentage points to 57.8%) and for those born in Canada (-2.9 percentage points to 59.6%). The relative stability of the employment rate among very recent immigrants masks the fact that, like youth as a whole, younger members of this group continue to face challenging labour market conditions. Among those aged 15 to 24, the three-month moving average of the employment rate fell to a similar degree on a year-over-year basis for those who landed within the past five years, those who landed more than five years ago, and those born in Canada. Among Indigenous Canadians, employment remains further from recovery for women than men Over the past several months, employment has remained further below pre-pandemic levels among Indigenous people compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts. This continued in December, with employment among Indigenous Canadians 7.8% below February levels, compared with 2.1% below for non-Indigenous Canadians (not seasonally adjusted). Using a three-month moving average of the employment rate to examine trends for smaller population groups shows that Indigenous women remain further below pre-pandemic levels than Indigenous men. Compared with one year earlier, the three-month moving average of the employment rate for Indigenous women was down 8.0 percentage points to 47.8% in December, compared with a 3.2 percentage point decline for Indigenous men to 57.1% (not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the drop in the employment rate among the non-Indigenous population was similar for men (-2.4 percentage points to 63.4%) and women (-2.6 percentage points to 55.7%). These differences are consistent with findings from earlier in the pandemic, as reported in Labour market impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous people: March to August 2020. Looking ahead: Working from home continues to be widespread in industries with little need for physical proximity A notable impact of COVID-19 has been the large-scale adoption of working from home as a means of balancing employment with the need to protect health and safety. With the labour market recording its first employment losses since April and public health measures being tightened in response to a new wave of COVID-19 infections, the continued viability of telework will be an important factor in the performance of the Canadian economy in 2021. While the proportion of Canadians working from home declined from a peak in April (41.6%) to a low in September (25.6%), before increasing slightly in the fall, the degree of change has varied by sector. In three industries—professional, scientific and technical services; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; and public administration—working from home has remained at elevated levels. These industries have the lowest proportions of workers in occupations that typically require close physical proximity to others, and all have regained or surpassed February employment levels. Chart 9 With the shift from remote learning to classrooms, the educational services industry has seen the largest decline in working from home In the educational services industry, the share of people working from home fell notably from April to December (down 48.9 percentage points to 33.3%). This is consistent with public health measures that required most schools to suddenly switch to remote learning in the spring, but that have since allowed many students and educators back into the classroom. As schools adjust to a new wave of COVID-19 cases in early 2021, a partial return to remote learning may influence the work location of teachers and other workers in this industry. The accommodation and food services industry, where work generally requires close physical proximity to others, had the lowest proportion of employees working from home in both April and December. This reflects the significant challenges facing this industry, which employed an average of 1.2 million Canadians in 2019 and where 25.8% fewer people were working in December than in February. As the New Year begins, Statistics Canada remains committed to informing Canadians of the ongoing effects of COVID-19 on the labour market, including the impact of public health measures and the challenges and opportunities for both workers and employers, which are likely to follow the unprecedented events of 2020.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for December are for the week of December 6 to 12. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. Since March 2020, all face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both interviewers and respondents. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. As has been the case each month since June, approximately 40,000 interviews were completed in December. The distribution of LFS interviews in December 2020 compared with November 2020, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • November 2020: 67.5% • December 2020: 67.6% Online interviews • November 2020: 32.5% • December 2020: 32.4% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in December 2020 analysis To continue capturing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the supplementary indicators used in March and April were slightly adapted. Therefore, the May to December supplementary indicators are not directly comparable to the supplementary indicators published in April and March 2020. Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Time-related underemployment rate combines people who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours as a proportion of all employed people. Information on population groups Beginning in July, the LFS includes a question asking respondents to report the population groups to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2016 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other For LFS records interviewed before July, population group characteristics were assigned using an experimental sample matching data integration method, which involves LFS and the Census of Population This historical data complements population group data collected directly in LFS, through a comparison of year-over-year changes in the unemployment rate. According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, data for the population who identify as Aboriginals are analyzed separately. The remaining category is described as ""people not designated as visible minorities"" or ""people who are not a visible minority."" Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Revisions to the Labour Force Survey To ensure that the LFS reflects current labour market conditions as accurately as possible, data are revised following each census to reflect the most recently available population estimates, geographic boundaries, and industry and occupation classifications. This standard revision process results in minor changes to recent and historical LFS data and has little impact on trends in key labour market indicators, such as employment, unemployment, and labour force participation rates. Changes to LFS data tables on the Statistics Canada website and information products resulting from this historical revision will be announced in The Daily on January 25, 2021. Next release The next release of the LFS will be on February 5, 2021.

Statistics for November on Employment Insurance (EI) reflect labour market conditions as of the week of November 8 to 14. In September and October, many provinces implemented targeted public health measures in response to a rise in COVID-19 cases. In early November, restrictions related to indoor dining and fitness facilities were eased in Ontario, while new measures were adopted in Manitoba, affecting restaurants, recreation facilities and retail businesses. Much of Quebec was faced with the ongoing closure of indoor dining and many recreational and cultural facilities. Regular EI beneficiaries down slightly from record number in October In November, 1.3 million Canadians received regular EI benefits, down 3.4% from a record 1.4 million in October. According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), a total of 1.7 million Canadians were unemployed during the week of November 8 to 14. The vast majority of the unemployed (1.5 million) were looking for work, while 253,000 still had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries down slightly from record number in October More than 1 in 10 regular EI beneficiaries qualified for EI as a result of the new rules In November, 12.4% of all regular EI beneficiaries qualified for EI as a result of temporary changes to eligibility rules introduced to the EI program in September 2020, up from 11.2% in October (not seasonally adjusted). The proportion of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules increased in every province, led by Newfoundland and Labrador (+2.5 percentage points) and Prince Edward Island (+2.1 percentage points). Chart 1 The proportion of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules increases in every province (not seasonally adjusted) The number of regular EI beneficiaries decreases in seven provinces The number of regular EI beneficiaries declined in seven provinces in November, led by British Columbia (-20,000; -11.3%) and Alberta (-19,000; -9.4%). According to the LFS, employment grew by 24,000 (+1.0%) in British Columbia in November, while it was little changed in Alberta. At the same time, Ontario (+4,100; +0.9%), Quebec (+5,400; +1.9%) and Manitoba (+3,800; +9.6%) recorded increases in the number of EI recipients. Results from the November LFS indicate that, amidst tightening of public health measures, employment growth continued to slow in Central Canada, while employment declined in Manitoba. On a regional basis, the number of EI beneficiaries decreased proportionally more in census agglomerations (CAs) (-16,000; -9.3%) and in regions outside census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and CAs (-17,000; -6.6%) than in CMAs (-14,000; -1.5%). Accommodation and food services account for largest share of regular EI beneficiaries In November, 75.3% of regular EI recipients last worked in the services-producing sector, compared with 59.5% in the same month a year ago (not seasonally adjusted). The industry hardest hit by public health measures—accommodation and food services—accounted for 18.5% of regular EI beneficiaries in November, up from 7.0% in November 2019. November LFS results showed a second consecutive monthly decline in employment in accommodation and food services, and employment in this industry remained farthest from pre-COVID February levels. Chart 2 Largest proportion of regular EI beneficiaries in accommodation and food services (not seasonally adjusted) Number of regular EI beneficiaries decreases significantly more among women than men The number of women receiving regular EI benefits fell by 38,000 (-5.7%) in November—a decrease that is almost five times greater than the decline among men (-8,000; -1.2%). The decrease in the number of regular EI recipients among women was driven by those aged 25 to 54 years (-16,000; -4.0%) and those aged 55 years and older (-16,000; -8.8%). Women accounted for 48.7% of all regular EI beneficiaries in November, a proportion that is notably higher than that of 37.3% recorded in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Male youth (aged 15 to 24) were the only age group to show an increase in the number of regular EI recipients in November (+2,000; +2.4%). Looking ahead In November, a little more than 8 in 10 (82.3%) regular EI recipients had also been EI recipients the previous month. This contrasts with November 2019, when 6 in 10 (60.7%) regular beneficiaries had received EI the month prior. According to the LFS, approximately 6 in 10 unemployed in October remained unemployed in November and one-quarter (25.6%) of all unemployed in November had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more. Going forward, EI statistics will continue to contribute to a better understanding of the ability of workers to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, as additional public health measures are being implemented in the second wave of the pandemic. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the November 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada Recovery Benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)). Concepts and methodology The analysis presented here focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. Claims data pertain to initial and renewal claims received for any type of EI benefits, including special benefits. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. Regular EI benefits are paid to eligible individuals who lose their jobs and who are available for and able to work, but cannot find a job. To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a claim. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits, and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March to November 2020 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Numbers in the Daily text are rounded to the nearest thousand. The number of regular EI beneficiaries and the number of claims received for the current month and the previous month are subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from November 8 to 14. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. However, claims data are for the entire month. New indicators introduced in October 2020 1. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals that only qualified for EI as a result of these program changes. 2. Beneficiaries who have not made a previous paid claim within the last five years The indicator of whether a beneficiary has made a previous paid claim in the past five years is based only on claims for EI. Whether or not the beneficiary received CERB payments between March and September 2020 is not used in the calculation of this indicator. 3. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and Record of Employment (ROE) administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. Geographical definitions A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centered on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – definitions for more information. Data availability A number of CODR data tables published on the Statistics Canada website remain suspended with the release of the November 2020 data. 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337: remain suspended, as of the December 2019 reference period, due to occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is on-going to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007, and 14-10-0008: remain suspended, as of the March 2020 reference period, due to a source data file containing records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. 14-10-0009: for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed due to data quality. Next release Data on EI for December 2020 will be released on February 18, 2021.

This was partially attributable to almost one-fifth more electric and hybrid buses and 52.2% more exclusive rights-of-way, or roadways reserved at all times for public transit use or other high-occupancy vehicles. The number of waste diversion facilities (recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion facilities) surpassed the number of active disposal facilities for the first time in 2018. More buses are hybrid and electric in 2018 Public transit systems had a modest boost in their rolling stock from 2016 to 2018. In 2018, municipalities and regional, provincial and territorial governments owned 18,132 public transit buses (+280 from 2016) and 3,646 railcars (+167 from 2016). While diesel buses comprised more than two-thirds (67.9%) of public transit bus fleets in 2018, the inventory of electric and hybrid buses grew by 18.6% from 2016 to 2018 and accounted for 12.8% of all buses. Bio-diesel buses accounted for another 14.9%. Quebec's bus fleet had the highest share of cleaner vehicles in 2018—more than two-fifths (44.8%) of the fleet ran on bio-diesel, and one-fifth (19.9%) of buses were hybrid or electric. Other rolling stock used for public transit in Canada included 1,740 specialized transit vehicles for persons with disabilities, which saw a sizable increase from 2016 (+459), and 245 streetcars. One-seventh (14.3%) of specialized transit assets were purchased in 2017 or 2018. Buses in Newfoundland and Labrador and British Columbia are in the best condition All buses were reported to be in good or very good condition in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2018. The province had the second-largest share (64.8%) of buses purchased since 2010, after Prince Edward Island (76.0%). British Columbia had the second-largest share (85.8%) of buses reported to be in good or very good condition. This was an 11.0% increase over 2016. More than one-tenth of the bus fleet in British Columbia was purchased in 2017 or 2018. In contrast, Nova Scotia had the largest share of buses reported to be in poor or very poor condition (36.2%), followed by New Brunswick (16.4%). Three-fifths of public transit buses in Nova Scotia were purchased before 2010. Nova Scotia also had the smallest share (1.1%) of its total bus fleet purchased in 2017 or 2018 among the provinces. The largest share of buses dating from before the year 2000 was in New Brunswick (15.7%). This was a marked improvement from 2016, however, when nearly one-third of its bus fleet was purchased prior to 2000. More than one-tenth(12.9%) of its bus fleet in 2018 was purchased in 2017 or 2018, making New Brunswick the province with the largest increase in buses reported to be in good or very good condition compared with 2016 (+15.8%). No buses were purchased for public transit in the territories in 2017 or 2018. The share of buses reported to be in good or very good condition decreased by over one-fifth in Yukon (-21.0%) and the Northwest Territories (-20.8%). Nunavut did not have any public transit assets in 2018. Majority of railcars are in good or very good condition In 2018, almost one-fifth of the heavy railcar (subway) and light railcar stock was purchased in 2017 or 2018, and close to half (45.9%) of all railcars, including commuter railcars, were less than 10 years old. More than four-fifths of railcars outside Quebec were reported to be in good or very good condition in 2018. The proportion of light railcars reported to be in poor or very poor condition fell from 40.2% in 2016 to 20.8% in 2018, and all of the railcars were in Alberta. Indeed, over one-fifth (22.5% of the stock) of the railcars in Alberta were reported to be in poor or very poor condition in 2018. Ontario accounted for almost half (49.1%) of public transit railcars owned by provincial, territorial, regional and local governments in Canada. It was also the lone province that had all three types of railcars in 2018—commuter, heavy (subway) and light railcars. All heavy and light railcars allowed for accessibility in 2018. More roadways reserved for public transit and high-occupancy vehicles in 2018 There were 315 exclusive rights-of-way, or roadways reserved at all times for public transit use or for other high-occupancy vehicles in 2018, up 52.2% from two years earlier. This gave Canadians the opportunity to maximize highway infrastructure while reducing energy usage per person-trip. British Columbia builds passenger stations and terminals in 2017 and 2018 Infrastructure such as bus shelters and terminals plays an essential role in public transit. In 2018, there were 27,564 transit shelters, 744 passenger stations and terminals, 11,073 bicycle racks and shelters, and 721 park-and-ride and passenger drop-off facilities in Canada. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta accounted for the vast majority (96.2%) of all passenger stations and terminals. Most (71.1%) of these facilities were in good or very good condition. In British Columbia, 54 passenger stations and terminals were completed in 2017 or 2018, accounting for over one-third (37.2%) of the province's inventory in 2018. Rural municipalities own over one-fifth of park-and-ride and passenger drop-off facilities The low population density and larger travel distances that characterize rural municipalities limit transportation options available to residents. Park-and-ride and passenger drop-off facilities provide easier access to public transit systems. Rural municipalities owned almost one-third (31.8%) of all passenger drop-off facilities and almost one-fifth (18.1%) of park-and-ride parking lots in Canada. Higher levels of government, such as regional, provincial and territorial governments, owned 23.0% of passenger drop-off facilities and 16.6% of park-and-ride parking lots. These facilities may be located in rural or urban areas. Rural municipalities also reported close to one-tenth (8.6%) of all specialized transit rolling stock, which includes transit services for persons with disabilities, as well as vehicles for other non-conventional transit services such as dial-a-ride. Regional, provincial and territorial governments owned 27.7% of these assets in Canada in 2018. Rural municipalities own the majority of solid waste assets In Canada, provincial, territorial, regional and municipal governments owned and operated 3,284 waste disposal facilities, 1,981 transfer stations and 1,532 waste diversion facilities in 2018. Solid waste tends to be processed outside city limits, with the majority of solid waste infrastructure owned by rural municipalities. However, in British Columbia, half (50.0%) of these assets were owned by regional governments, while all solid waste services were provided by the province in Prince Edward Island. On average, there was one active waste disposal facility (excluding the 1,785 closed sites) for every 3.4 municipalities in 2018. Active waste disposal facilities included 737 dump sites, 716 engineered landfills, 26 incinerators and 20 energy-from-waste facilities. Including closed sites, over half (52.5%) of publicly owned waste disposal facilities in Canada were under the responsibility of municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents, mostly rural municipalities. Excluding closed sites, this share increases to 64.2%. More waste facilities focus on recycling and composting than on active disposal in 2018 Every province and territory except Nunavut had at least one publicly owned composting facility and one materials recovery facility in 2018. The number of waste diversion facilities (recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion facilities) surpassed the number of active disposal facilities in 2018. While active disposal facilities accounted for 54.7% of total waste diversion and active disposal assets in 2016, their share dropped to just under half (49.5%) in 2018. The growing importance of waste diversion is reflected in the data. From 2010 to 2018, about two-fifths of publicly-owned waste diversion facilities were made operational, compared with 14.0% of waste disposal facilities. Over half (55.2%) of waste disposal facilities were built before 2000, while just under one-tenth (9.6%) of active dump sites and engineered landfills were constructed before 1970. In contrast, two waste diversion facilities (0.1% of the stock) were built prior to 1970 and less than one-fifth (18.9%) prior to 2000. Table 1 Number of publicly owned rolling stock public transit assets, by type, Canada, 2018 Note to readers Canada's Core Public Infrastructure Survey of 2018 was conducted in partnership with Infrastructure Canada. The survey results cover nine asset types (roads; bridges and tunnels; culture, recreation and sports facilities; potable water; public transit; public social and affordable housing; solid waste; storm water; wastewater). The data cover topics such as stock, condition, performance and asset management strategies. Data are based on responses from approximately 2,520 government organizations selected from Statistics Canada's Business Register, the central repository of information on public and private organizations operating in Canada. It is used as the principal frame for most of Statistics Canada's economic statistical programs. The following organizations are included in the survey: provincial and territorial departments and ministries regional governments urban and rural municipalities selected provincial Crown corporations and public transit authorities. Estimates for 2018 may not be comparable with those for 2016 because of improved coverage and definitions, and changes in survey methodology, including an expanded target population. From 2016 to 2018, the questionnaire for Canada's Core Public Infrastructure Survey underwent several major changes. Responses to the questionnaire were collected through an electronic platform instead of a paper questionnaire. Questions were streamlined to reduce response burden. The survey included a census of all municipalities with at least 1,000 inhabitants and a sample of municipalities with between 500 and 1,000 inhabitants. For Quebec, the survey was conducted by the Institut de la statistique du Québec. Respondents were provided the following condition rating scale when asked to rate the overall physical condition of their assets: Very poor: Immediate need to replace most or all of the asset. There are health and safety hazards that present a possible risk to public safety, or the asset cannot be serviced or operated without risk to personnel. Major work or replacement is required urgently. The operating asset has less than 10% of its expected service life remaining. Poor: Failure likely and substantial work required in the short term. Asset barely serviceable. No immediate risk to health or safety. The operating asset has less than 40% of its expected service life remaining. Fair: Significant deterioration is evident; minor components or isolated sections of the asset need replacement or repair now, but the asset is still serviceable and functions safely at an adequate level of service. The operating asset has at least 40% of its expected service life remaining. Good: Acceptable physical condition; minimal short-term failure risk, but potential for deterioration in the long term. Only minor work required. The operating asset has at least 80% of its expected service life remaining. Very good: Sound physical condition. The asset is likely to perform adequately. The operating asset has at least 95% of its expected service life remaining.

Wholesale sales grew for the seventh consecutive month in November—up 0.7% to an all-time high of $67.4 billion. Five of seven subsectors reported stronger sales, led by the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector and the building material and supplies subsector. Notably, the increase reflects higher domestic sales of Canadian goods, as both imports and exports of key commodities fell in November. Wholesale trade volumes increased 0.9% in November. Chart 1 Wholesale sales increase in November Wholesale sector continues to show strength The demand for wholesale goods largely held firm through November as sales grew for the seventh consecutive month. This occurred notwithstanding the fact that some restrictions on business activities started to be tightened in some provinces in November in response to the second wave of COVID-19. However, for the most part, significant restrictions did not come into effect until December. November sales were 4.4% higher than the pre-pandemic level recorded in February 2020, with six of the seven subsectors' sales higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. Additionally, all subsectors posted sales in November 2020 that were higher than in November 2019, as was the case for October 2020 compared with October 2019. The performance of the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector, as well as the building material and supplies subsector, has been the foundation of the recovery in the wholesale sector since the spring. This may be in part because the products sold by companies in these subsectors (e.g., computers and electronics, smart phones, home renovation materials, large machinery) are tied closely to activities and businesses that have been allowed to continue or have been in high demand during the pandemic. At $1.3 billion above February 2020 levels, sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector have surpassed pre-COVID-19 levels by more than any other subsector, followed by the building material and supplies subsector at $1.1 billion above pre-COVID-19 levels. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories subsector remains the furthest behind, and the only subsector whose November sales were not higher than pre-pandemic levels. Sales rise in five subsectors Five of the seven wholesale subsectors reported higher sales in November, representing more than 80% of the sector. The increases came despite weaker imports and exports of key products. Sales of machinery, equipment and supplies rose 2.8% to $14.3 billion. This was the fourth increase in the past six months, bringing total sales to their highest level on record. Three of the four industries in the subsector reported gains. Higher sales in this subsector reflect greater domestic sales as exports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts fell 0.7% in November. Sales of building material and supplies rose 1.1% to $10.2 billion, the sixth increase in the past seven months, reaching a record high in November. The increase reflects primarily higher sales in the lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies industry, which makes up more than half of the subsector. It appears that this increase was also driven by stronger domestic sales as exports of lumber and other sawmill products fell approximately 10% in November. Sales of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and accessories fell 1.8% to $11.1 billion—the first decline after six months of gains. Despite the decline, sales were 5.6% higher than in November of 2019. As in the other subsectors, the domestic market was a source of the higher sales of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and accessories as exports fell 4.1% in November. Higher sales in nine provinces Sales increased in nine provinces in November, accounting for more than 98% of total wholesale sales. Alberta, Ontario and Quebec led the gains, while Nova Scotia was the only province that posted a slight decrease for the month. Alberta sales rose 2.1% to $6.6 billion—its second straight month of growth. Higher sales were recorded in four of the seven subsectors, led by a 7.7% increase in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector. After three months of declining sales, the subsector posted its second consecutive month of gains, with increases in all industries. Sales in Ontario continued to rise in November, up 0.2% to $35.0 billion—the third consecutive increase and the sixth in the past seven months. The building material and supplies subsector and the miscellaneous subsector led the gains for Ontario, more than offsetting the lower sales in the other five subsectors. The building material and supplies subsector posted higher sales across all three of its industries for the second month in a row. The motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories subsector mitigated the increase in Ontario. Quebec sales increased 0.6% to $12.6 billion in November. Higher sales were recorded in five of the seven subsectors. The personal and household goods subsector rose 2.8% to $2.7 billion, led by strong growth in the pharmaceuticals and pharmacy supplies industry in November. The building material and supplies subsector (+1.3% to $2.0 billion) built off the strength in the metal service centres industry and the lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies industry. Conversely, a decrease of 2.2% to $1.3 billion in the miscellaneous subsector was headed by weak sales in the chemical (except agricultural) and allied products industry and the recyclable material industry. Nova Scotia was the only province to post a decline in November, as sales fell 0.6% to $927 million. The food, beverage and tobacco subsector (-4.8% to $302 million) posted the largest decline in the province, reflecting a sharp decline in the sale of fish and seafood products. Inventories fall for a second month Wholesale inventories fell for the second month in a row. November inventories decreased 0.6% to $89.6 billion—its lowest level since March 2019. Lower inventories were reported in all seven subsectors in November. The machinery, equipment and supplies subsector posted the largest decreases—down 1.1% to $26.6 billion. Decreases in the inventory of the construction, forestry, mining, and industrial machinery, equipment and supplies industry more than offset the gains in the three other industries within the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector. The personal and household goods subsector's inventories fell 0.6% to $15.9 billion in November. The home furnishings industry and the toiletries, cosmetics and sundries industry led the decreases in inventories for this subsector. The inventory-to-sales ratio fell for the second straight month to 1.33 for November—the lowest level since May 2018. This ratio is a measure of the time (in months) required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain at their current level. Table 1 Wholesale merchants' sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Wholesale merchants' sales by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Wholesale merchants' inventories by industry – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruptions. Total wholesale sales expressed in volume are calculated by deflating current dollar values using relevant price indexes. The wholesale sales series in chained (2012) dollars is a chained Fisher volume index, with 2012 as the reference year. For more information, see Deflation of wholesale sales. The Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey covers all industries within the wholesale trade sector, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), with the exception of oilseed and grain merchant wholesalers (NAICS 41112); petroleum and petroleum products merchant wholesalers (NAICS 412); and business-to-business electronic markets, and agents and brokers (NAICS 419).

Exports of goods $46.8 billion November 2020 0.5% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. Goods trade balance -$3.3 billion November 2020 Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. In November, Canada's merchandise exports increased 0.5%, with gold exports posting the largest increase. Imports edged down 0.3%, on lower imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts. As a result, Canada's merchandise trade deficit with the world narrowed from $3.7 billion in October, to $3.3 billion in November. Chart 1 Merchandise exports and imports Following a number of significant increases and decreases earlier in the year, the rate of change in Canada's trade activity slowed in November, with total trade edging up 0.1%. This represented the smallest monthly percentage change in 2020. To explore the most recent results from Canada's international merchandise trade in an interactive format, see the ""International merchandise trade monthly interactive dashboard."" Exports of gold to the United Kingdom surge Total exports were up 0.5% in November to $46.8 billion—$1.5 billion below the pre-COVID-19-pandemic mark set in February. Despite this growth, 7 out of 11 product sections posted declines. Non-energy exports increased 0.2% to $39.9 billion, $129 million shy of their February levels. In real (or volume) terms, total exports rose 0.9%. Chart 2 Contribution to the monthly change in exports, by product, November 2020 Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products increased 11.6% in November, mainly on higher exports of unwrought gold, silver and platinum group metals, and their alloys (+25.8%). Increased exports of refined gold to the United Kingdom were behind this surge, resulting from a rise in sales of cast gold bullion bars, as well as higher transfers of gold within the banking system. Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals (+26.0%) also rose significantly in November. Increases in exports of copper ores (+84.6%) and iron ores (+26.0%) both contributed strongly to the growth in this product section. Despite the pandemic, market conditions (rising prices, strong foreign demand, and supply issues in other countries) have been advantageous for Canadian producers of copper and iron ores in 2020. These factors contributed to an atypical increase in exports of these commodities in November. So far in 2020, exports of both copper and iron ores have already surpassed their 2019 totals. Chart 3 Canadian exports of iron and copper ores These increases were offset in part by lower exports of motor vehicles and parts (-4.1%). After a 7.2% decrease in October, exports of passenger cars and light trucks (-4.0%) fell again in November. Exports of engines and parts (-4.4%) were also down, coinciding with lower motor vehicle production in the United States. Exports of forestry products and building and packaging materials (-6.2%) also declined in November. This was primarily the result of lower exports of lumber (-11.6%), which were down mainly on lower prices. After months of rising prices that peaked in September, lumber prices stabilized in October and then decreased in November. However, these prices remained significantly higher in November compared with May, when the increase began. Following two months of growth, imports of industrial machinery fall Total imports decreased 0.3% in November to $50.1 billion, which was still above pre-pandemic levels. This was the first decline after five consecutive months of growth. In real (or volume) terms, imports were down 0.7%. Chart 4 Contribution to the monthly change in imports, by product, November 2020 Imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts decreased 3.9% in November to $5.3 billion—the second decline in seven months. Since the 21.3% decrease in April, imports of industrial machinery and equipment have increased 28.0%. The decrease in imports of other general-purpose machinery and equipment (-6.8%) contributed the most to the decline this month. In October, high-value shipments of wind turbines from China related to a new wind farm project were observed. These shipments were not repeated in November. Chart 5 Canadian imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts Imports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals decreased 11.0% in November. Despite the monthly decline, imports of this product section were already up by 5.9% in 2020 compared with the full year of 2019. Both the monthly decrease and annual growth were attributable primarily to imports of other metal ores and concentrates—a category composed largely of gold for refining purposes. This month's decrease in imports of other metal ores and concentrates (-23.2%) was mainly the result of lower imports of gold from Peru. These decreases were partially offset by higher imports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts (+16.2%). Imports of aircraft led the increase, in part because of two new airliners imported from Ireland. Imports of aircraft have been affected heavily by the pandemic. So far in 2020, the value of these imports has decreased 39.0% compared with the same period in 2019—a year affected by supply issues resulting from the grounding of some airliners. Exports to non-US countries reach a record on higher exports of gold The divergent trend between Canada's trade with the United States versus Canada's trade with other countries continued in November. Total trade with countries other than the United States was up 2.1% in November, reaching a record $33.1 billion. Total trade with the United States decreased 1.0% to $63.8 billion—the lowest level since June. While total trade with countries other than the United States was up $3.4 billion in November compared with February, total trade with the United States was $4.8 billion below the levels observed that month. A significant part of that gap is the result of lower exports and imports of energy products. In November, exports to countries other than the United States rose 7.4%, a sixth increase in the last seven months. The United Kingdom was by far the largest contributor to the growth in Canada's exports to non-US countries—the result of higher exports of refined gold. Imports from countries other than the United States were down 1.3% in November. Imports from Peru, South Korea and Germany saw the largest decreases. After reaching a record high in October, imports from China remained high, despite falling 2.1% on lower imports of wind turbines. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States narrowed from $6.9 billion in October to $5.7 billion in November. Exports to the United States fell 2.2% in November, while imports edged up 0.3%. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States narrowed from $3.1 billion in October to $2.3 billion in November. Chart 6 Canada's imports and exports with the United States and countries other than the United States When the average exchange rates of October and November are compared, the Canadian dollar gained 0.8 cents US relative to the American dollar, reaching its highest level (76.5 cents US) since October 2018. Chart 7 International merchandise trade balance Revisions to October merchandise exports and imports data Imports in October, originally reported as $50.2 billion in the previous release, were revised to $50.3 billion in the current month's release. Exports in October, originally reported at $46.5 billion in the previous release, were essentially unchanged in the current month's release. Trade in medical and protective goods Following two consecutive monthly declines, imports of medical and protective goods increased 6.7% in November to $3.3 billion on a customs basis. Higher imports of diagnostic products (+35.4%) and medical equipment and products (+8.8%) were moderated by lower imports of personal protective equipment (-8.9%) and disinfectant and sterilization products (-14.8%). Year over year, imports of medical and protective goods were up 46.3%. Meanwhile, exports of medical and protective goods decreased 8.3% to $1.4 billion in November because of lower exports of medical equipment and products (-8.9%). Much of the monthly fluctuation in imports of diagnostic products, as well as imports and exports of medical equipment and products, resulted from variations in trade unrelated to COVID-19. Monthly trade in services In November, monthly service exports were up 1.0% to $9.4 billion, and service imports edged down 0.1% to $9.3 billion. When international trade in goods and services are combined, exports increased 0.6% to $56.2 billion in November, while imports fell 0.3% to $59.4 billion. As a result, Canada's trade deficit with the world for goods and services combined was $3.2 billion in November.

International trade data by commodity are available on both a BOP and customs basis. International trade data by country are available on a customs basis for all countries, and on a BOP basis for Canada's 27 principal trading partners (PTPs). The list of PTPs is based on their annual share of total merchandise trade—imports and exports—with Canada in 2012. BOP data are derived from customs data by adjusting for factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions of the Canadian System of National Accounts. For a conceptual analysis of BOP-based data versus customs-based data, see ""Balance of Payments trade in goods at Statistics Canada: Expanding geographic detail to 27 principal trading partners."" For more information on these and other macroeconomic concepts, see the Methodological Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-607-X) and the User Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-606-G). The data in this release are on a BOP basis and are seasonally adjusted. Unless otherwise stated, values are expressed in nominal terms, or current dollars. References to prices are based on aggregate Paasche (current-weighted) price indexes (2012=100). Movements within aggregate Paasche prices can be influenced by changes in the share of values traded for specific goods, with sudden shifts in trading patterns—as observed currently with the pandemic—sometimes resulting in large movements in Paasche price indexes. Volumes, or constant dollars, are calculated using the Laspeyres formula (2012=100), unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Revisions In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current-year revisions are reflected in both the customs-based and BOP-based data. The previous year's customs-based data are revised with the release of data for the January and February reference months, and thereafter on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs-based data are revised annually, and revisions are released in February with the December reference month. The previous year's BOP-based data are revised with the release of data for the January, February, March and April reference months. To remain consistent with the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts, revisions to BOP-based data for previous years are released annually in December with the October reference month. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of import and export documentation, incorrect information on customs forms, the replacement of estimates produced for the energy section with actual figures, changes in merchandise classification based on more current information, and changes to seasonal adjustment factors. For information on data revisions for exports of energy products, see Methodology for Exports of Energy Products within the International Merchandise Trade Program. Revised data are available in the appropriate tables. Real-time data table The real-time data table 12-10-0120-01 will be updated on January 18.

One of them was business solvency. Insolvencies were down by almost one-third year over year during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and were relatively stable in the third quarter. At the height of this century's previous economic shocks, insolvencies rose by 10% or more. A new study looks at insolvencies during the largest economic upheaval of our lifetime. Historically, insolvencies increase during economic downturns The financial crisis of 2008 had an immediate impact on the number of insolvencies in Canada (see note to readers). Insolvencies rose 11.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and reached a record high of 816 in the first quarter of 2009. The 2014 oil crash also had a major economic impact on the Canadian economy, particularly in the oil patch. Oil prices (Western Canadian Select) fell from US$83 in July 2014 to US$37 in February 2015, and this affected businesses in oil and gas extraction and supporting industries. This was reflected in the number of insolvencies, which increased by one-quarter to 779 from the third to the fourth quarter of 2014. Insolvencies buck the trend during the early stages of the pandemic The pandemic has posed significant challenges to the Canadian economy and the financial position of enterprises. The second quarter of 2020 saw the steepest decline in real gross domestic product (-11.3%) since quarterly data were first collected in 1961. Over the same period, businesses reported lower net income before taxes (-8.6%) and operating revenues (-13.1%). Despite the economic headwinds caused by the pandemic, insolvencies fell by almost one-third (-29.4%) year over year to 474 in the second quarter. This decline came at a time when many businesses were closed for a month or longer, and those that remained open faced a new and often more costly business reality. In the third quarter of 2020, the number of insolvencies was unchanged at 474, down 13.8% year over year. Insolvencies were down in most industries in the second quarter, led by the construction industry (-32.1%, or -45). According to the Survey on the Canada Emergency Business Account, the construction industry had the largest share (14.1%) of loan approvals among industries in April and May through the Canada Emergency Business Account. Most businesses that filed for insolvency in 2020 were already in trouble prior to the pandemic The study also looks at the average quick and debt-to-equity ratios for businesses that filed for insolvency during the first three quarters of 2020 to better understand the financial position of these businesses. The study suggests that businesses that filed for insolvency in 2020 were already in a precarious financial situation before the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with the help of government programs, these corporations decided to file for insolvency. However, the fact that the number of insolvencies has decreased since the onset of the pandemic could indicate that businesses are waiting to see whether more government aid will be forthcoming and whether they will be able to manage their debt levels before filing for insolvency. Low borrowing costs for businesses could also partially explain this drop. According to the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, over two-fifths (43.9%) of businesses reported that they were unable to take on more debt in the third quarter. This suggests that insolvencies may increase in the coming quarters as the financial position of businesses deteriorates. Note to readers This release examines the changes in the number of businesses that filed under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act from 2006 to the third quarter of 2020. The analysis highlights the number of firms filing for creditor protection, as well as the financial position of these firms before the onset of the pandemic. While this release focuses on smaller businesses filing under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the study on which it is based also looks at large corporations that filed under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.

Percentage of total GDP attributable to natural resources 9.1% Third quarter 2020 Source(s): Table 38-10-0285-01. Natural resources real gross domestic product drops slightly Real gross domestic product (GDP) of the natural resources sector edged up 0.3% in the third quarter, following a record 10.7% decline in the second quarter. Gains in the minerals and forestry subsectors were mostly offset by continued declines in the energy subsector, partly owing to weak international trade. In contrast, economy-wide real GDP rose 8.9% in the third quarter, following an 11.3% drop in the second quarter—the sharpest fluctuations ever recorded. Chart 1 Natural resources real gross domestic product A 3.0% decline in the energy subsector was attributable in large part to decreased extractions of crude oil (-3.9%) and natural gas (-6.8%) for three consecutive quarters. Led by increases in gold, copper, nickel, lead and zinc mining, notably in British Columbia and Ontario, the real GDP of metallic minerals rose 18.0%, after declining 16.1% in the previous quarter. This increase was moderated to some extent by a decline in non-metallic minerals (-7.0%), in particular, potash mining was down substantially, owing to factors that included the derailment of a train (near Hope, British Columbia) carrying a large amount of potash and COVID-19 outbreaks at some sites in Saskatchewan. Real GDP of the forestry subsector rose 11.8%, reflecting a sharp upturn (+34.7%) in activity in primary sawmill and wood products, influenced by a record increase in housing investment (+30.2%). Hunting, fishing and water rose 9.3%, following a 5.7% drop in the second quarter. Export volumes decline but import volumes rise Natural resources export volumes fell 2.5% in the third quarter, continuing the 12.0% drop in the second quarter. Declines in exports of energy (-2.8%) and minerals and mining (-3.8%) were partly offset by increased forestry exports (+3.1%). Import volumes rose 2.4%, after declining 12.8% in the second quarter. A substantial rebound occurred in primary sawmills (+12.4%), reflecting a resurgence of housing activity. Canada has long been a net exporter of natural resources—export values are generally about double those of imports. Natural resource prices and nominal GDP rebound Overall, natural resource prices rose 12.1% after declining 12.3% and 6.1% in the second and first quarters, respectively. The fluctuations were led by crude oil prices, which rose 40.7% following a 36.2% drop in the second quarter and a 20.3% drop in the first, reflecting the volatility of crude oil prices in the world market. The first quarter's decline resulted primarily from higher production by Russia and Saudi Arabia. The second quarter's decline was attributable to a sharp drop in demand owing to a slump in the world economy. In the third quarter, crude oil prices began to recover. Chart 2 Natural resource prices The higher prices boosted growth in natural resources nominal GDP by 12.4% in the third quarter, following a 21.7% drop in the second quarter. Expressed as an annual rate, the nominal GDP of natural resources was $190.8 billion in the third quarter, representing 9.1% of the Canadian economy. The energy subsector's share of the natural resources GDP was 59.9% in the third quarter, followed by minerals and mining (24.5%); forestry (9.2%); and hunting, fishing and water (6.4%). Employment partly recovers Chart 3 Employment changes, third quarter of 2020 Employment in the natural resources sector rose 2.5% after declining 8.4% in the second quarter. Job recovery was highest in the forestry subsector (+5,760 jobs) because of increased demand stemming from the housing subsector, followed by minerals and mining (+5,600 jobs); energy (+1,650); and hunting, fishing and water (+1,550). Downstream activities rebound For analytical purposes, secondary and tertiary processing for the forestry and minerals and mining subsectors are identified separately. With the rise in economy-wide GDP, the nominal GDP of these downstream activities reached $7.5 billion in the third quarter, a 21.0% increase that followed a 22.2% drop in the second quarter. Much of this change stemmed from higher volumes, as prices increased 0.5% in the third quarter and 0.6% in the second. Note to readers Data on natural resources for the third quarter of 2020 have been released along with revised data back to the first quarter of 2017, after incorporating the 2017 benchmark supply and use tables. The natural resource indicators provide quarterly indicators for the main aggregates in the Natural Resource Satellite Account (NRSA), namely, gross domestic product, output, exports, imports and employment. The estimates from this account are directly comparable to the estimates in the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts. In particular, the employment estimates reported in this release align with the following definitions of natural resource subsectors. Consequently, these estimates may differ from those that will be released by the labour productivity program. Core natural resources: The NRSA defines natural resource activities as those that result in goods and services originating from naturally occurring assets used in economic activity, as well as their initial processing (primary manufacturing). Downstream activities: Although not part of the core account, natural resources have important downstream effects on other sectors. In general, this production uses a large portion of primary manufactured products as inputs. Next release Data on natural resource indicators for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be released on March 25, 2021.

Proportion of population living in a census metropolitan area 71.8% July 1, 2020 0.1 pt (annual change) Source(s): Table 17-10-0135-01. Population growth in Canada's large urban regions slows, but still outpaces that of other regions In most large urban regions (census metropolitan areas [CMAs]) in the country, population growth slowed from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020, compared with the same period a year earlier (+1.3% compared with +1.7%). However, the long-term trend of urbanization continued over that period, as the other regions of the country grew at a lower rate (+0.6%). On July 1, 2020, 27.3 million people, or just over 7 in 10 Canadians (71.8%) lived in a CMA. Despite lower international migration (permanent and temporary) due to travel restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19, international migration accounted for the vast majority (90.3%) of the growth in CMAs from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. In comparison, it accounted for just over one-third of the population growth in other regions of the country. Chart 1 Population growth rate by census metropolitan area, 2019/2020, Canada Excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 has had a limited impact on the slowing population growth in urban centres, despite urban centres being the epicentres of the pandemic. In the CMA of Montréal (+0.7%), for example, net international migration declined by over 23,000 from 2018/2019 levels, falling from 72,827 to 49,729. This decrease widely exceeded the number of COVID-19-related deaths in the CMA of Montréal, even though the region recorded the most COVID-19-related deaths nationally during the first wave of the pandemic. The CMA of Oshawa (+2.1%) recorded the fastest growing population, followed by the CMAs of Halifax and Kitchener–Cambridge–Waterloo (both up 2.0%) and Kelowna, Calgary and Saskatoon (all three up 1.9%). Urban sprawl continues, with Toronto and Montréal both experiencing record-high population losses to surrounding areas More people are opting to live outside of Canada's largest urban centres, which is contributing to ongoing urban sprawl. Despite still showing overall positive population growth, mostly due to international migration, the CMAs of Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver continued to see more people moving out to other regions of their province rather than moving in. From July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020, the CMAs of Toronto (-50,375) and Montréal (-24,880) each posted a record loss of people as a result of these population exchanges. In Toronto, the net loss was mainly driven by people moving to surrounding CMAs. For example, the population growth in Oshawa (+2.1%)—which posted the fastest growth—was partly due to migration flows from the neighbouring CMA of Toronto. High population growth rates in municipalities located close to the Montréal CMA, like Farnham (+5.2%) and Saint-Hippolyte (+4.1%), were also partly due to migratory flows coming from the Montréal CMA. Urban sprawl continued within Canada's three largest CMAs, with the fastest growing municipalities more often found in suburban areas. For example, the municipalities of Milton (+4.0%) and Brampton (+3.4%) grew at the fastest pace among those within the Toronto CMA (+1.4%). Similarly, the municipalities of Mirabel (+3.6%) and New Westminster (+2.8%) were among the fastest growing in the CMAs of Montréal (+0.7%) and Vancouver (+1.1%), respectively. The desire to live outside the largest urban centres was also reflected in the rapidly increasing housing costs in neighbouring real estate markets, a trend that has continued in spite of the pandemic. Personal health, the ability to work remotely, and higher housing costs are among the most important factors contributing to the decision of many Canadians to continue (or to no longer continue) living in large urban centres hardest hit by the pandemic. Whatever the exact reasons, urban sprawl is an important trend to monitor. Chart 2 Distribution of population by age group and census metropolitan area, Canada, July 1, 2020 Table 1 Annual population estimates by census metropolitan area, July 1, 2020 Note to readers This release focuses mainly on preliminary postcensal population estimates for census metropolitan areas by age and sex as of July 1, 2020. Revised estimates as of July 1, for the years 2017 to 2019, are also available. Population estimates are also released for census agglomerations, census divisions, census subdivisions and economic regions. See the Tables tab for more information. Historical analysis of net intraprovincial migration is based on data for the years 2001/2002 to 2019/2020, inclusively. This period represents the extent to which comparable intraprovincial migration estimates are available. This analysis is based on preliminary data. These data will be revised over the coming year, and it is possible that some trends described in this study will change as a result of these revisions. Therefore, this analysis should be interpreted with caution. The estimates released today are based on 2016 Census counts, adjusted for census net undercoverage and incompletely enumerated Indian reserves, to which are added the population growth estimates for the period from May 10, 2016, to the date of the estimate. These estimates are based on the 2016 Standard Geographical Classification. The annual period of reference comprises the period of July 1 of a certain year to July 1 of the following year. Therefore, 2019/2020 refers to the period from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020. For the purpose of calculating rates, the denominator is the average population during the period (the average of the start-of-period and end-of-period populations). For the sake of brevity, the terms growth, population growth and population growth rate have the same meaning. A rate higher than -0.1% and lower than 0.1% is considered not significant. A census metropolitan area is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre (known as the core). A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000, of which 50,000 or more must live in the core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from census place of work data. Census subdivision is the general term for municipalities (as determined by provincial/territorial legislation) or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes (e.g., Indian reserves, Indian settlements and unorganized territories). For the sake of brevity, the terms census subdivision and municipality have the same meaning.

Excluding energy and petroleum products, the IPPI rose 0.9%. The gain in the IPPI was led mainly by higher prices for lumber and other wood products (+10.8%), particularly softwood lumber (+21.7%). This increase comes after two months of decline in October and November, following record and near-record increases from July to September. Prices for energy and petroleum products (+7.9%) also contributed significantly to the increase in the IPPI, particularly refined petroleum energy products (+9.2%) such as diesel and biodiesel fuels (+10.1%) and motor gasoline (+7.7%). Prices for primary non-ferrous metal products (+3.1%) also supported the IPPI's growth, led mainly by higher prices for unwrought aluminum and aluminum alloys (+8.1%) and unwrought copper and copper alloys (+7.6%). Prices for chemicals and chemical products (+2.2%) also posted an increase in December. Prices for meat, fish and dairy products (-3.4%) declined in December, led mainly by decreased prices for fresh and frozen beef and veal (-11.3%), as well as for fresh and frozen pork (-8.4%). Year over year, the IPPI increased 1.5%. Excluding energy and petroleum products, the IPPI rose 4.4% year over year. Chart 1 Industrial Product Price Index (January 2018 to December 2020) Chart 2 Softwood lumber (January 2018 to December 2020) Table 1 Industrial Product Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Note to readers To provide Canadians with timely economic data, Statistics Canada is releasing early estimates of the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) for December 2020. These are referred to as flash estimates and are subject to revision when the index is officially released on January 29, 2021. Because flash estimates are calculated using preliminary data, these values should be used with caution. Basket update and methodology changes Starting with the October 2020 reference period, the IPPI and Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) are using an updated basket and methodology. The indexes have been converted from 2010 = 100 to January 2020 = 100 and also updated to use a weighting pattern based on the 2016 production values of Canadian manufacturers. At the same time, the IPPI and RMPI have been modernized with the adoption of a weighted geometric (Jevons) formula and the incorporation of parental imputation as the default imputation methodology for missing price quotes. The IPPI and RMPI are now using the North American Product Classification System Canada 2017 version 2.0 and the North American Industry Classification System Canada 2017 version 3.0.

November data are now available from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), which provides monthly information on payroll employment, earnings and hours worked in Canada, the provinces and territories. SEPH provides an account of payroll employment, that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. Preliminary monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are also now available for November. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), data from SEPH and JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions. Payroll employment declines in November Payroll employment fell 79,500 (-0.5%) in November—the first decline since May. The total number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer was down 1.1 million (-6.6%) compared with February. The November Labour Force Survey (LFS)—for the week of November 8 to 14—recorded an increase of 55,000 (+0.3%) in the number of people with a job or business. Chart 1 First payroll employment decline after five-month-long recovery Payroll employment down in four provinces As adjustments to tighter public health measures continued in November, payroll employment fell in four provinces: Manitoba (-1.7%; -9,700), Quebec (-1.2%; -42,900), Alberta (-0.7%; -12,500) and Ontario (-0.4%; -25,300), reflecting the impact of these measures. At the same time, increases were observed in Prince Edward Island (+0.7%; +400) and British Columbia (+0.4%; +7,800), while there was little change in the remaining provinces. In early November, restrictions related to indoor dining and fitness facilities were eased in Ontario. Later in the month, however, the regions of Peel and Toronto were moved from ""Red Control"" level to ""Lockdown,"" with indoor and outdoor dining services, personal care services, and indoor sports and recreational facilities required to close. In Manitoba, the province was moved to ""critical level red"" on November 12 and new measures affecting restaurants, recreational facilities and retail businesses were implemented. Much of Quebec remained at the ""red"" alert level in November, leading to the ongoing closure of indoor dining and many recreational and cultural facilities. In Alberta, targeted measures introduced on November 24 required the closure of many entertainment and recreation facilities, but not in-person dining services. Hourly paid employees account for all of the payroll employment decline in November The decline in payroll employment in November was entirely attributable to hourly paid employees (-1.0%; -86,600). Hourly paid employees tend to earn significantly less than salaried employees. In February 2020, for example, salaried employees earned an average of $1,410 per week, while hourly paid employees earned an average of $800 per week. In November, the number of hourly paid employees was 8.7% below its pre-COVID level, compared with 3.7% below the pre-COVID level for salaried employees. In May, the number of hourly paid employees was 25.5% below its pre-COVID level, compared with 7.8% below the pre-COVID level for salaried employees. Average weekly earnings up as lower-paid employees post larger share of job losses Average weekly earnings were $1,110 in November, up 0.6% compared with October. This brought the year-over-year increase in earnings to 6.6%, as job losses since February have been concentrated among hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees. Little change in both total and average hours worked Total hours worked were little changed in November, and were 5.5% below the pre-COVID level. By comparison, during the recent low in May, total hours worked were 16.6% below the February level. Average hours worked per week were little changed in November at 33.5 hours, a level at which the average has been hovering since July. In February, before COVID-19, payroll employees worked an average of 33.0 hours per week. Decline in payroll employment driven by losses in services-producing sector In November, payroll employment fell in the services-producing sector (-0.4%; -45,500), the first decline for this sector since May. Losses were largely concentrated in accommodation and food services (-48,200), with smaller declines in several other sectors, including arts, entertainment and recreation (-8,800) and transportation and warehousing (-6,700). Employment in the goods-producing sector was little changed. In November, payroll employment in the services-producing sector and the goods-producing sector was 6.8% and 4.7% below the pre-COVID level, respectively. Accommodation and food services post the largest decline in November Payroll employment in accommodation and food services fell by 48,200 (-4.7%) in November, the first decline since May. Most of the monthly decline was in full-service restaurants and limited-service eating places (-37,400), consistent with restrictions on indoor and outdoor dining in several provinces. The number of payroll employees also decreased notably in the traveller accommodation (-4,700) and drinking places (-4,400) industries. The monthly decline in accommodation and food services brought payroll employment to 27.8% below its February level, with employment in the drinking places industry declining by almost half (-48.0%) over that period. In November, all of the monthly decline in accommodation and food services was in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba, in line with ongoing public health measures in these provinces. As reported in the Daily release on food services and drinking places, sales in this subsector fell for a second consecutive month, down 3.7% to $4.5 billion in November. On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in accommodation and food services were little changed at $431. This sector has traditionally been the lowest paying among all industrial sectors. The vast majority of payroll employees in this sector are paid on an hourly basis. In 2019, almost 9 out of 10 (88.4%) payroll employees in accommodation and food services were hourly paid, compared with an average of 58.2% for all sectors. Chart 2 Impacts vary across accommodation and food services industries Employment declines in arts, entertainment and recreation as public health measures are tightened in several provinces In arts, entertainment and recreation, payroll employment fell by 8,800 (-3.9%) in November, the result of declines in the amusement, gambling and recreation industries subsector. Within the subsector, all of the losses were in the other amusement and recreation industries category, which includes skiing facilities as well as recreational, sports and fitness centres. The largest losses in this sector were observed in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba—four provinces where restrictions on public gatherings had been tightened and sports and fitness centres closed at some point during the month. Compared with February, payroll employment in arts, entertainment and recreation was down by 31.2% (-98,200), with all of the decline among hourly paid employees. Within the sector, payroll employment in the performing arts, spectator sports and related industries subsector continued to be the furthest from its pre-pandemic level in November (-48.0%; -30,700). In terms of numbers of payroll jobs, however, the largest decline from February to November was in the amusement, gambling and recreation industries subsector (-28.2%; -62,600). Average weekly earnings in arts, entertainment and recreation were $706 in November, up 13.7% compared with 12 months earlier. Payroll employment down in transportation and warehousing Following two months of strong growth, payroll employment in transportation and warehousing fell by 6,700 (-0.9%) in November. This brought payroll employment in the sector to 4.7% below the level in February, which was still above the low in May, when payroll employment was down 13.5% from February. Month over month, decreases were largest in warehousing and storage (-1,900;-3.0%), postal service (-1,700; -2.2%) and truck transportation (-1,500; -0.8%). On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in the transportation and warehousing sector grew 5.5% to $1,164. Health care and social assistance nearing pre-COVID level of employment Payroll employment in health care and social assistance rose for a sixth consecutive month, up 11,600 (+0.6%) in November, bringing the sector to within 0.2% of its pre-COVID level. In November, payroll employment was above the pre-COVID level in nursing and residential care facilities (+3.7% compared with February) and in ambulatory health care services (+2.9%), while it was below the February level in hospitals (-1.3%) and in social assistance (-7.6%). The gap between the November and February levels of employment in social assistance was largely due to individual and family services (which include, for example, services for the elderly and people with disabilities) and child day-care services, where, despite a gain in November, employment was still 9.4% and 9.8% below the pre-COVID level, respectively. Average weekly earnings in health care and social assistance were $1,012 in November, up 6.7% compared with 12 months earlier. Chart 3 Payroll employment above February level in nursing and residential care facilities and ambulatory health care services Payroll employment growth in construction stalls After six consecutive months of growth, payroll employment in construction was little changed in November, and was 4.4% below the pre-pandemic February level. At its lowest point in April, payroll employment in construction was 22.9% below its February level. As reported in the Daily release on investment in building construction, total investment in building construction declined for a third consecutive month, edging down 0.1% to $15.3 billion in November. In November, payroll employment in construction increased in Quebec (+1.2%; +2,600), Newfoundland and Labrador (+4.5%; +600), and Nova Scotia (+0.5%; +100). These gains were offset primarily by decreases in Alberta (-1.1%; -1,700), Ontario (-0.2%; -700), and Manitoba (-1.0%; -300). Average weekly earnings in the construction sector were $1,339 in November, up 4.8% compared with 12 months earlier. Payroll employment little changed in manufacturing Payroll employment in manufacturing was little changed in November, and was 4.8% below the level observed in February. In November, increases in food manufacturing (+0.7%; +1,700) and primary metal manufacturing (+2.2%; +1,200) were offset by declines in other subsectors and industries. In particular, payroll employment declined in aerospace product and parts (-5.6%; -2,600). According to Monthly Survey of Manufacturing data, aerospace production fell 23.8% in November, following a 5.5% decrease in October. Average weekly earnings in manufacturing were $1,175 in November, up 1.9% compared with 12 months earlier. Employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction furthest from recovery among goods-producing sectors Payroll employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction was little changed in November, and was further from full recovery than any other goods-producing sector, at 7.9% below the February level. The lag in recovery of payroll employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction was almost entirely driven by Alberta, which held half of the national payroll employment in this sector in February. In Alberta, payroll employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction has continued to trend downward since February, decreasing in November (-0.4%; -500) to 15.2% below the February level. In the rest of Canada (excluding Alberta), payroll employment in the sector had almost fully recovered and was 0.6% below the pre-COVID level in November, after falling 9.5% below its February level in May. Average weekly earnings in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction were $2,074 in November, little changed compared with 12 months earlier. Monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey In November, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 523,000 positions as they continued to navigate public health measures and the threat of COVID-19 (not seasonally adjusted). The job vacancy rate, which represents vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied) was 3.3% in November, following a rate of 3.5% in October (not seasonally adjusted). While monthly and quarterly job vacancy statistics are not directly comparable due to seasonal patterns and month-to-month variation within quarters, prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the quarterly job vacancy rate ranged from 3.0% to 3.5% between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. The job vacancy rate is a key measure of unmet labour demand and, in conjunction with other indicators such as payroll employment and the unemployment rate, it provides valuable insight into the labour market. For example, a high job vacancy rate could represent either an increased pace of recruiting, or difficulty on the part of employers in finding or retaining suitable candidates. Health care and social assistance has most vacancies and highest vacancy rate In November, the health care and social assistance sector accounted for more than one-fifth (112,700) of all job vacancies, and had a job vacancy rate of 5.2% (not seasonally adjusted). For reference, the job vacancy rate for this sector was 3.8% in October and ranged from 3.0% to 3.3% from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, payroll employment in health care and social assistance had been on a long-term upward trend. Since reaching a low in May, employment in the sector has been trending up, with most of the recent employment growth being in ambulatory health care services and social assistance. In November, the job vacancy rate was highest in Yukon (4.2%) and Quebec (4.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). The job vacancy rates were lowest in Saskatchewan (1.7%) and Manitoba (2.1%). The remaining provinces all posted job vacancy rates between 2.7% and 3.6%. Information on job vacancies will continue to be incorporated in future monthly releases of payroll estimates results. A more detailed analysis will be released with the quarterly estimates (October to December 2020) of the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey in March 2021. Looking ahead December SEPH results—to be released on February 25—will provide detailed information on the subsectors that continue to be most affected by the re-implementation and tightening of measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees, and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only, and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupations for Canada, the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wage and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable due to survey operations being temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates, and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. In addition, year-over-year comparisons between estimates of different frequencies (month vs quarter) should be interpreted with caution as job vacancy statistics can vary month to month within a quarter. While JVWS employment is calibrated to Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ due to calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on February 15, 2021. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours and job vacancies for December 2020 will be released on February 25, 2021.

The number of exporting enterprises in Canada grew by 0.4% in November to reach 19,399, the highest level since February 2020. This increase was led by manufacturing exporters, a sector generally less affected by government restrictions than the services sector. Compared with the low in April, the total number of exporters in November had recovered by over 3,000 enterprises. Nonetheless, Canada still had nearly 1,000 fewer exporting enterprises (-4.8%) than were recorded in February, before the pandemic. Among all exporters, enterprises with fewer than 50 employees (small enterprises) were most affected by economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of small enterprises was down by 774 (-5.3%) from February, compared with a drop of 196 (-3.4%) among medium and large enterprises. However, in each month from May to September, small enterprises recovered faster than medium and large enterprises. Chart 1 Percentage change (month over month) in number of exporting enterprises, by enterprise employment size, March to November 2020 Change in number of exporters varies across provinces An enterprise can have multiple establishments located in different provinces or territories and operating in various industries. November's increase in the number of exporting establishments (+139) was concentrated in Quebec (+119) and Ontario (+63). For Quebec, the increase was the largest since June and was led by the manufacturing sector. The other two provinces whose exporter numbers rose were Saskatchewan and Alberta, with November being Alberta's seventh consecutive month of growth. The overall increase in exporters was attenuated by fewer exporters from British Columbia (-27) and the Atlantic region (-28), with that region's largest decline observed in New Brunswick. Nonetheless, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, along with Manitoba, were still above their pre-pandemic (February) level of exporters. More exporters to United States, fewer to China and Europe On a geographical basis, much of November's increase in exporters was from more enterprises selling to the United States, up by 0.8% to 15,991. Conversely, the number of enterprises exporting to China was down 3.8%, its largest decrease since February. In the context of several major European trading partners implementing a second round of lockdowns during the month of November, the number of enterprises exporting to the United Kingdom (-6.1%), France (-3.3%), Italy (-2.2%) and Germany (-2.2%) declined. However, the number of exporters to Spain (+6.8%) and the Netherlands (+3.2%) was up. Both destinations saw increases in the number of exporters from Ontario. The number of exporters to the Netherlands was above its level in February, before the pandemic (+6.1%). The Netherlands is an entry point for many Canadian goods, which may ultimately reach other European destinations. Chart 2 Change (month over month) in number of exporting enterprises, by major trading partner, October to November 2020 More firms in the professional, scientific and technical services sector export goods to Europe year over year In general, the effects of the pandemic were more pronounced for establishments in the services-producing sector. Firms in services-producing industries were particularly hard hit in exporting to the United States. The number of establishments in the services sector that exported to the United States was down 15.5% from November 2019, with the largest declines in wholesale trade; retail trade; and professional, scientific and technical services. Since April, the number of firms exporting to all major trading partner destinations in Europe has recovered at a faster rate than the number of firms exporting to the United States, with a strong resumption of export activity within the services sector, particularly for the United Kingdom. While some key industries within the services sector (wholesale trade and retail trade) posted year-over-year declines, the professional, scientific and technical services sector recorded an increase in the number of establishments exporting to the United Kingdom (+8.4%) and the European Union (+2.2%) from November 2019 to November 2020. Chart 3 Percentage change (year over year) in number of establishments exporting to selected regions, by industry, November 2019 to November 2020 Note to readers The monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics program will be discontinued following the release of reference month December 2020. Seasonal adjustment With this release, the monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics program incorporates data that have been seasonally adjusted to track the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian exporters on a month-to-month basis. Seasonal adjustment techniques that remove the effect of seasonal and calendar influences from the original data can sharpen the extent to which a time series can be used to evaluate meaningful changes in economic conditions over time. Seasonally adjusted data are available at aggregated levels such as the number of exporters by province, by major country of destination, by enterprise employment size, etc. For more detailed information such as the number of exporters at the industry level by province, data are available on an unadjusted basis only. The analysis in this text, unless stated otherwise, is conducted using seasonally adjusted data. For more information on seasonal adjustment, consult Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The term major trading partners refers to Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States, Brazil, Japan, China and India. These countries represent a subset of the countries defined as Canada's principal trading partners as per the Canadian International Merchandise Trade program and the Balance of International Payments program and are among those that have been the most impacted by COVID-19 in terms of confirmed cases. Methodology The monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics release is a special product that is being published specifically to provide Canadians with timely information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian exporters. Seasonally adjusted data are available from January 2019 to November 2020 at aggregated levels only. For more detailed levels, data are available from January 2019 to November 2020 on a customs basis and unadjusted for seasonal variation. Monthly export data for reference year 2019 are derived from the annual production database, while data for January to November 2020 are newly developed based on a similar linkage methodology used for the annual Trade by Exporter Characteristics – Goods (TEC–Goods) program. Prior to January 2020, data on exports to non-US destinations were collected by Statistics Canada. In January 2020, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) began collecting non-US export data and transmitting them to Statistics Canada on a daily basis. Exporters were gradually transitioned to the CBSA collection system, and collection by Statistics Canada was phased out completely later in 2020. Data collection remains unchanged for exports to the United States; the US Census Bureau collects and transmits the data to Statistics Canada each month under the terms of the Canada–US data exchange. Overall, a very similar linkage methodology is applied to this 23-month monthly time series as to the annual data, ensuring that consistency between monthly and annual data is maintained. For each month from January 2019 to November 2020, the total number of identified exporters accounted for 99% of the total domestic export value. The number of exporters corresponds to the number of exporters identified in the Business Register (2020). The total value of exports refers to all transactions that can be linked from the monthly domestic exports (customs basis) database. In this release, data disseminated at the provincial level are conceptually different from customs-based merchandise export data. Provincial data for the TEC–Goods program are based on the province where the exporters are located. Goods can be shipped to other provinces for final consumption or can be shipped from other provinces when leaving Canada. Customs-based merchandise exports are based on the province of origin, which is the province in which the goods are grown, produced, extracted or manufactured. Monthly domestic export (customs basis) data can be obtained from Canadian International Merchandise Trade (Customs Basis). Data availability Unadjusted and seasonally adjusted data on monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics are available upon request.

This was the seventh consecutive monthly gain. The increase was led by higher sales at food and beverage stores, along with an uptick in e-commerce sales. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—rose 2.6% on higher sales at food and beverage (+5.9%) and general merchandise (+1.6%) stores, as well as building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.2%). Sales were up in 7 of 11 subsectors, representing 53.4% of retail trade. In volume terms, retail sales rose 1.2% in November. Because of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in Canada, government officials began to reintroduce physical distancing measures, which directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, approximately 3% of retailers were closed during November. The average length of the shutdown was one business day. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 2.6% in December. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 59% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 87.1%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in November Lower sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers In November, sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers (-0.9%) declined for the first time since April. Sales were down at three out of four store types, led by new car dealers (-1.0%). New motor vehicle sales were down 6.7% year over year in dollar terms in November. Sales of trucks, an aggregate group that includes light trucks, heavy trucks and buses, decreased 4.0% year over year, while passenger car sales (-20.5%) were down by one-fifth. Nevertheless, new motor vehicle sales were up 7.6% compared with pre-pandemic levels (February 2020). Sales at gasoline stations (-1.6%) declined for the second consecutive month. In volume terms, sales were down 2.2%. Increase in core retail sales led by food and beverage stores Core retail sales (+2.6%) rose for the fourth consecutive month in November. The growth was led by food and beverage stores (+5.9%), specifically supermarkets and other grocery (except convenience) stores (+6.5%). General merchandise stores (+1.6%) reported higher sales in November, following a 0.5% decline in October. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.2%) rose for the fourth consecutive month. Clothing and clothing accessories store (-3.0%) sales fell for the second month in a row, with all three store types reporting declines, led by clothing stores (-2.8%). Chart 2 Sales up in 7 of 11 subsectors Sales up in nine provinces Sales rose in nine provinces in November, led by higher sales in Quebec and Ontario. In Quebec, sales increased 2.0%, with the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montréal up 1.5%. Sales in Ontario (+0.9%) rose for the seventh consecutive month. In the CMA of Toronto, sales rose 0.3%. The increase in sales in both provinces were driven by food and beverage stores. The increase in New Brunswick (+6.0%) was due to higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Manitoba (-3.1%) was the sole province reporting a decline, on lower sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores. Retail e-commerce sales surge On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached $4.3 billion in November, accounting for 7.4% of total retail trade—the largest share since May. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales (7.4%) rose 2.0 percentage points from October and was up 3.0 percentage points year over year. The rise in sales coincided with retailers urging online shoppers to buy early to avoid shipping delays, as well as promotional events such as Black Friday. Retail e-commerce sales were up by three-quarters (+75.9%) year over year in November, while total unadjusted retail sales increased 5.8%. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce increased 2.7%. Chart 3 Retail e-commerce increases in November Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate for retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are the exact same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. For information regarding cannabis statistics, consult the Cannabis Stats Hub. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they too are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

Statistics for November on Employment Insurance (EI) reflect labour market conditions as of the week of November 8 to 14. In September and October, many provinces implemented targeted public health measures in response to a rise in COVID-19 cases. In early November, restrictions related to indoor dining and fitness facilities were eased in Ontario, while new measures were adopted in Manitoba, affecting restaurants, recreation facilities and retail businesses. Much of Quebec was faced with the ongoing closure of indoor dining and many recreational and cultural facilities. Regular EI beneficiaries down slightly from record number in October In November, 1.3 million Canadians received regular EI benefits, down 3.4% from a record 1.4 million in October. According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), a total of 1.7 million Canadians were unemployed during the week of November 8 to 14. The vast majority of the unemployed (1.5 million) were looking for work, while 253,000 still had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries down slightly from record number in October More than 1 in 10 regular EI beneficiaries qualified for EI as a result of the new rules In November, 12.4% of all regular EI beneficiaries qualified for EI as a result of temporary changes to eligibility rules introduced to the EI program in September 2020, up from 11.2% in October (not seasonally adjusted). The proportion of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules increased in every province, led by Newfoundland and Labrador (+2.5 percentage points) and Prince Edward Island (+2.1 percentage points). Chart 1 The proportion of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules increases in every province (not seasonally adjusted) The number of regular EI beneficiaries decreases in seven provinces The number of regular EI beneficiaries declined in seven provinces in November, led by British Columbia (-20,000; -11.3%) and Alberta (-19,000; -9.4%). According to the LFS, employment grew by 24,000 (+1.0%) in British Columbia in November, while it was little changed in Alberta. At the same time, Ontario (+4,100; +0.9%), Quebec (+5,400; +1.9%) and Manitoba (+3,800; +9.6%) recorded increases in the number of EI recipients. Results from the November LFS indicate that, amidst tightening of public health measures, employment growth continued to slow in Central Canada, while employment declined in Manitoba. On a regional basis, the number of EI beneficiaries decreased proportionally more in census agglomerations (CAs) (-16,000; -9.3%) and in regions outside census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and CAs (-17,000; -6.6%) than in CMAs (-14,000; -1.5%). Accommodation and food services account for largest share of regular EI beneficiaries In November, 75.3% of regular EI recipients last worked in the services-producing sector, compared with 59.5% in the same month a year ago (not seasonally adjusted). The industry hardest hit by public health measures—accommodation and food services—accounted for 18.5% of regular EI beneficiaries in November, up from 7.0% in November 2019. November LFS results showed a second consecutive monthly decline in employment in accommodation and food services, and employment in this industry remained farthest from pre-COVID February levels. Chart 2 Largest proportion of regular EI beneficiaries in accommodation and food services (not seasonally adjusted) Number of regular EI beneficiaries decreases significantly more among women than men The number of women receiving regular EI benefits fell by 38,000 (-5.7%) in November—a decrease that is almost five times greater than the decline among men (-8,000; -1.2%). The decrease in the number of regular EI recipients among women was driven by those aged 25 to 54 years (-16,000; -4.0%) and those aged 55 years and older (-16,000; -8.8%). Women accounted for 48.7% of all regular EI beneficiaries in November, a proportion that is notably higher than that of 37.3% recorded in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Male youth (aged 15 to 24) were the only age group to show an increase in the number of regular EI recipients in November (+2,000; +2.4%). Looking ahead In November, a little more than 8 in 10 (82.3%) regular EI recipients had also been EI recipients the previous month. This contrasts with November 2019, when 6 in 10 (60.7%) regular beneficiaries had received EI the month prior. According to the LFS, approximately 6 in 10 unemployed in October remained unemployed in November and one-quarter (25.6%) of all unemployed in November had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more. Going forward, EI statistics will continue to contribute to a better understanding of the ability of workers to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, as additional public health measures are being implemented in the second wave of the pandemic. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the November 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada Recovery Benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB), Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB), and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)). Concepts and methodology The analysis presented here focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. Claims data pertain to initial and renewal claims received for any type of EI benefits, including special benefits. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. Regular EI benefits are paid to eligible individuals who lose their jobs and who are available for and able to work, but cannot find a job. To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a claim. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits, and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March to November 2020 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Numbers in the Daily text are rounded to the nearest thousand. The number of regular EI beneficiaries and the number of claims received for the current month and the previous month are subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from November 8 to 14. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. However, claims data are for the entire month. New indicators introduced in October 2020 1. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals that only qualified for EI as a result of these program changes. 2. Beneficiaries who have not made a previous paid claim within the last five years The indicator of whether a beneficiary has made a previous paid claim in the past five years is based only on claims for EI. Whether or not the beneficiary received CERB payments between March and September 2020 is not used in the calculation of this indicator. 3. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and Record of Employment (ROE) administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. Geographical definitions A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centered on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – definitions for more information. Data availability A number of CODR data tables published on the Statistics Canada website remain suspended with the release of the November 2020 data. 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337: remain suspended, as of the December 2019 reference period, due to occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is on-going to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007, and 14-10-0008: remain suspended, as of the March 2020 reference period, due to a source data file containing records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. 14-10-0009: for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed due to data quality. Next release Data on EI for December 2020 will be released on February 18, 2021.

This was partially attributable to almost one-fifth more electric and hybrid buses and 52.2% more exclusive rights-of-way, or roadways reserved at all times for public transit use or other high-occupancy vehicles. The number of waste diversion facilities (recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion facilities) surpassed the number of active disposal facilities for the first time in 2018. More buses are hybrid and electric in 2018 Public transit systems had a modest boost in their rolling stock from 2016 to 2018. In 2018, municipalities and regional, provincial and territorial governments owned 18,132 public transit buses (+280 from 2016) and 3,646 railcars (+167 from 2016). While diesel buses comprised more than two-thirds (67.9%) of public transit bus fleets in 2018, the inventory of electric and hybrid buses grew by 18.6% from 2016 to 2018 and accounted for 12.8% of all buses. Bio-diesel buses accounted for another 14.9%. Quebec's bus fleet had the highest share of cleaner vehicles in 2018—more than two-fifths (44.8%) of the fleet ran on bio-diesel, and one-fifth (19.9%) of buses were hybrid or electric. Other rolling stock used for public transit in Canada included 1,740 specialized transit vehicles for persons with disabilities, which saw a sizable increase from 2016 (+459), and 245 streetcars. One-seventh (14.3%) of specialized transit assets were purchased in 2017 or 2018. Buses in Newfoundland and Labrador and British Columbia are in the best condition All buses were reported to be in good or very good condition in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2018. The province had the second-largest share (64.8%) of buses purchased since 2010, after Prince Edward Island (76.0%). British Columbia had the second-largest share (85.8%) of buses reported to be in good or very good condition. This was an 11.0% increase over 2016. More than one-tenth of the bus fleet in British Columbia was purchased in 2017 or 2018. In contrast, Nova Scotia had the largest share of buses reported to be in poor or very poor condition (36.2%), followed by New Brunswick (16.4%). Three-fifths of public transit buses in Nova Scotia were purchased before 2010. Nova Scotia also had the smallest share (1.1%) of its total bus fleet purchased in 2017 or 2018 among the provinces. The largest share of buses dating from before the year 2000 was in New Brunswick (15.7%). This was a marked improvement from 2016, however, when nearly one-third of its bus fleet was purchased prior to 2000. More than one-tenth(12.9%) of its bus fleet in 2018 was purchased in 2017 or 2018, making New Brunswick the province with the largest increase in buses reported to be in good or very good condition compared with 2016 (+15.8%). No buses were purchased for public transit in the territories in 2017 or 2018. The share of buses reported to be in good or very good condition decreased by over one-fifth in Yukon (-21.0%) and the Northwest Territories (-20.8%). Nunavut did not have any public transit assets in 2018. Majority of railcars are in good or very good condition In 2018, almost one-fifth of the heavy railcar (subway) and light railcar stock was purchased in 2017 or 2018, and close to half (45.9%) of all railcars, including commuter railcars, were less than 10 years old. More than four-fifths of railcars outside Quebec were reported to be in good or very good condition in 2018. The proportion of light railcars reported to be in poor or very poor condition fell from 40.2% in 2016 to 20.8% in 2018, and all of the railcars were in Alberta. Indeed, over one-fifth (22.5% of the stock) of the railcars in Alberta were reported to be in poor or very poor condition in 2018. Ontario accounted for almost half (49.1%) of public transit railcars owned by provincial, territorial, regional and local governments in Canada. It was also the lone province that had all three types of railcars in 2018—commuter, heavy (subway) and light railcars. All heavy and light railcars allowed for accessibility in 2018. More roadways reserved for public transit and high-occupancy vehicles in 2018 There were 315 exclusive rights-of-way, or roadways reserved at all times for public transit use or for other high-occupancy vehicles in 2018, up 52.2% from two years earlier. This gave Canadians the opportunity to maximize highway infrastructure while reducing energy usage per person-trip. British Columbia builds passenger stations and terminals in 2017 and 2018 Infrastructure such as bus shelters and terminals plays an essential role in public transit. In 2018, there were 27,564 transit shelters, 744 passenger stations and terminals, 11,073 bicycle racks and shelters, and 721 park-and-ride and passenger drop-off facilities in Canada. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta accounted for the vast majority (96.2%) of all passenger stations and terminals. Most (71.1%) of these facilities were in good or very good condition. In British Columbia, 54 passenger stations and terminals were completed in 2017 or 2018, accounting for over one-third (37.2%) of the province's inventory in 2018. Rural municipalities own over one-fifth of park-and-ride and passenger drop-off facilities The low population density and larger travel distances that characterize rural municipalities limit transportation options available to residents. Park-and-ride and passenger drop-off facilities provide easier access to public transit systems. Rural municipalities owned almost one-third (31.8%) of all passenger drop-off facilities and almost one-fifth (18.1%) of park-and-ride parking lots in Canada. Higher levels of government, such as regional, provincial and territorial governments, owned 23.0% of passenger drop-off facilities and 16.6% of park-and-ride parking lots. These facilities may be located in rural or urban areas. Rural municipalities also reported close to one-tenth (8.6%) of all specialized transit rolling stock, which includes transit services for persons with disabilities, as well as vehicles for other non-conventional transit services such as dial-a-ride. Regional, provincial and territorial governments owned 27.7% of these assets in Canada in 2018. Rural municipalities own the majority of solid waste assets In Canada, provincial, territorial, regional and municipal governments owned and operated 3,284 waste disposal facilities, 1,981 transfer stations and 1,532 waste diversion facilities in 2018. Solid waste tends to be processed outside city limits, with the majority of solid waste infrastructure owned by rural municipalities. However, in British Columbia, half (50.0%) of these assets were owned by regional governments, while all solid waste services were provided by the province in Prince Edward Island. On average, there was one active waste disposal facility (excluding the 1,785 closed sites) for every 3.4 municipalities in 2018. Active waste disposal facilities included 737 dump sites, 716 engineered landfills, 26 incinerators and 20 energy-from-waste facilities. Including closed sites, over half (52.5%) of publicly owned waste disposal facilities in Canada were under the responsibility of municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents, mostly rural municipalities. Excluding closed sites, this share increases to 64.2%. More waste facilities focus on recycling and composting than on active disposal in 2018 Every province and territory except Nunavut had at least one publicly owned composting facility and one materials recovery facility in 2018. The number of waste diversion facilities (recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion facilities) surpassed the number of active disposal facilities in 2018. While active disposal facilities accounted for 54.7% of total waste diversion and active disposal assets in 2016, their share dropped to just under half (49.5%) in 2018. The growing importance of waste diversion is reflected in the data. From 2010 to 2018, about two-fifths of publicly-owned waste diversion facilities were made operational, compared with 14.0% of waste disposal facilities. Over half (55.2%) of waste disposal facilities were built before 2000, while just under one-tenth (9.6%) of active dump sites and engineered landfills were constructed before 1970. In contrast, two waste diversion facilities (0.1% of the stock) were built prior to 1970 and less than one-fifth (18.9%) prior to 2000. Table 1 Number of publicly owned rolling stock public transit assets, by type, Canada, 2018 Note to readers Canada's Core Public Infrastructure Survey of 2018 was conducted in partnership with Infrastructure Canada. The survey results cover nine asset types (roads; bridges and tunnels; culture, recreation and sports facilities; potable water; public transit; public social and affordable housing; solid waste; storm water; wastewater). The data cover topics such as stock, condition, performance and asset management strategies. Data are based on responses from approximately 2,520 government organizations selected from Statistics Canada's Business Register, the central repository of information on public and private organizations operating in Canada. It is used as the principal frame for most of Statistics Canada's economic statistical programs. The following organizations are included in the survey: provincial and territorial departments and ministries regional governments urban and rural municipalities selected provincial Crown corporations and public transit authorities. Estimates for 2018 may not be comparable with those for 2016 because of improved coverage and definitions, and changes in survey methodology, including an expanded target population. From 2016 to 2018, the questionnaire for Canada's Core Public Infrastructure Survey underwent several major changes. Responses to the questionnaire were collected through an electronic platform instead of a paper questionnaire. Questions were streamlined to reduce response burden. The survey included a census of all municipalities with at least 1,000 inhabitants and a sample of municipalities with between 500 and 1,000 inhabitants. For Quebec, the survey was conducted by the Institut de la statistique du Québec. Respondents were provided the following condition rating scale when asked to rate the overall physical condition of their assets: Very poor: Immediate need to replace most or all of the asset. There are health and safety hazards that present a possible risk to public safety, or the asset cannot be serviced or operated without risk to personnel. Major work or replacement is required urgently. The operating asset has less than 10% of its expected service life remaining. Poor: Failure likely and substantial work required in the short term. Asset barely serviceable. No immediate risk to health or safety. The operating asset has less than 40% of its expected service life remaining. Fair: Significant deterioration is evident; minor components or isolated sections of the asset need replacement or repair now, but the asset is still serviceable and functions safely at an adequate level of service. The operating asset has at least 40% of its expected service life remaining. Good: Acceptable physical condition; minimal short-term failure risk, but potential for deterioration in the long term. Only minor work required. The operating asset has at least 80% of its expected service life remaining. Very good: Sound physical condition. The asset is likely to perform adequately. The operating asset has at least 95% of its expected service life remaining.

Wholesale sales grew for the seventh consecutive month in November—up 0.7% to an all-time high of $67.4 billion. Five of seven subsectors reported stronger sales, led by the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector and the building material and supplies subsector. Notably, the increase reflects higher domestic sales of Canadian goods, as both imports and exports of key commodities fell in November. Wholesale trade volumes increased 0.9% in November. Chart 1 Wholesale sales increase in November Wholesale sector continues to show strength The demand for wholesale goods largely held firm through November as sales grew for the seventh consecutive month. This occurred notwithstanding the fact that some restrictions on business activities started to be tightened in some provinces in November in response to the second wave of COVID-19. However, for the most part, significant restrictions did not come into effect until December. November sales were 4.4% higher than the pre-pandemic level recorded in February 2020, with six of the seven subsectors' sales higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. Additionally, all subsectors posted sales in November 2020 that were higher than in November 2019, as was the case for October 2020 compared with October 2019. The performance of the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector, as well as the building material and supplies subsector, has been the foundation of the recovery in the wholesale sector since the spring. This may be in part because the products sold by companies in these subsectors (e.g., computers and electronics, smart phones, home renovation materials, large machinery) are tied closely to activities and businesses that have been allowed to continue or have been in high demand during the pandemic. At $1.3 billion above February 2020 levels, sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector have surpassed pre-COVID-19 levels by more than any other subsector, followed by the building material and supplies subsector at $1.1 billion above pre-COVID-19 levels. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories subsector remains the furthest behind, and the only subsector whose November sales were not higher than pre-pandemic levels. Sales rise in five subsectors Five of the seven wholesale subsectors reported higher sales in November, representing more than 80% of the sector. The increases came despite weaker imports and exports of key products. Sales of machinery, equipment and supplies rose 2.8% to $14.3 billion. This was the fourth increase in the past six months, bringing total sales to their highest level on record. Three of the four industries in the subsector reported gains. Higher sales in this subsector reflect greater domestic sales as exports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts fell 0.7% in November. Sales of building material and supplies rose 1.1% to $10.2 billion, the sixth increase in the past seven months, reaching a record high in November. The increase reflects primarily higher sales in the lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies industry, which makes up more than half of the subsector. It appears that this increase was also driven by stronger domestic sales as exports of lumber and other sawmill products fell approximately 10% in November. Sales of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and accessories fell 1.8% to $11.1 billion—the first decline after six months of gains. Despite the decline, sales were 5.6% higher than in November of 2019. As in the other subsectors, the domestic market was a source of the higher sales of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and accessories as exports fell 4.1% in November. Higher sales in nine provinces Sales increased in nine provinces in November, accounting for more than 98% of total wholesale sales. Alberta, Ontario and Quebec led the gains, while Nova Scotia was the only province that posted a slight decrease for the month. Alberta sales rose 2.1% to $6.6 billion—its second straight month of growth. Higher sales were recorded in four of the seven subsectors, led by a 7.7% increase in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector. After three months of declining sales, the subsector posted its second consecutive month of gains, with increases in all industries. Sales in Ontario continued to rise in November, up 0.2% to $35.0 billion—the third consecutive increase and the sixth in the past seven months. The building material and supplies subsector and the miscellaneous subsector led the gains for Ontario, more than offsetting the lower sales in the other five subsectors. The building material and supplies subsector posted higher sales across all three of its industries for the second month in a row. The motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories subsector mitigated the increase in Ontario. Quebec sales increased 0.6% to $12.6 billion in November. Higher sales were recorded in five of the seven subsectors. The personal and household goods subsector rose 2.8% to $2.7 billion, led by strong growth in the pharmaceuticals and pharmacy supplies industry in November. The building material and supplies subsector (+1.3% to $2.0 billion) built off the strength in the metal service centres industry and the lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies industry. Conversely, a decrease of 2.2% to $1.3 billion in the miscellaneous subsector was headed by weak sales in the chemical (except agricultural) and allied products industry and the recyclable material industry. Nova Scotia was the only province to post a decline in November, as sales fell 0.6% to $927 million. The food, beverage and tobacco subsector (-4.8% to $302 million) posted the largest decline in the province, reflecting a sharp decline in the sale of fish and seafood products. Inventories fall for a second month Wholesale inventories fell for the second month in a row. November inventories decreased 0.6% to $89.6 billion—its lowest level since March 2019. Lower inventories were reported in all seven subsectors in November. The machinery, equipment and supplies subsector posted the largest decreases—down 1.1% to $26.6 billion. Decreases in the inventory of the construction, forestry, mining, and industrial machinery, equipment and supplies industry more than offset the gains in the three other industries within the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector. The personal and household goods subsector's inventories fell 0.6% to $15.9 billion in November. The home furnishings industry and the toiletries, cosmetics and sundries industry led the decreases in inventories for this subsector. The inventory-to-sales ratio fell for the second straight month to 1.33 for November—the lowest level since May 2018. This ratio is a measure of the time (in months) required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain at their current level.

Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruptions. Total wholesale sales expressed in volume are calculated by deflating current dollar values using relevant price indexes. The wholesale sales series in chained (2012) dollars is a chained Fisher volume index, with 2012 as the reference year. For more information, see Deflation of wholesale sales.

In November, Canada's merchandise exports increased 0.5%, with gold exports posting the largest increase. Imports edged down 0.3%, on lower imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts. As a result, Canada's merchandise trade deficit with the world narrowed from $3.7 billion in October, to $3.3 billion in November. Chart 1 Merchandise exports and imports Following a number of significant increases and decreases earlier in the year, the rate of change in Canada's trade activity slowed in November, with total trade edging up 0.1%. This represented the smallest monthly percentage change in 2020. To explore the most recent results from Canada's international merchandise trade in an interactive format, see the ""International merchandise trade monthly interactive dashboard."" Exports of gold to the United Kingdom surge Total exports were up 0.5% in November to $46.8 billion—$1.5 billion below the pre-COVID-19-pandemic mark set in February. Despite this growth, 7 out of 11 product sections posted declines. Non-energy exports increased 0.2% to $39.9 billion, $129 million shy of their February levels. In real (or volume) terms, total exports rose 0.9%. Chart 2 Contribution to the monthly change in exports, by product, November 2020 Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products increased 11.6% in November, mainly on higher exports of unwrought gold, silver and platinum group metals, and their alloys (+25.8%). Increased exports of refined gold to the United Kingdom were behind this surge, resulting from a rise in sales of cast gold bullion bars, as well as higher transfers of gold within the banking system. Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals (+26.0%) also rose significantly in November. Increases in exports of copper ores (+84.6%) and iron ores (+26.0%) both contributed strongly to the growth in this product section. Despite the pandemic, market conditions (rising prices, strong foreign demand, and supply issues in other countries) have been advantageous for Canadian producers of copper and iron ores in 2020. These factors contributed to an atypical increase in exports of these commodities in November. So far in 2020, exports of both copper and iron ores have already surpassed their 2019 totals. Chart 3 Canadian exports of iron and copper ores These increases were offset in part by lower exports of motor vehicles and parts (-4.1%). After a 7.2% decrease in October, exports of passenger cars and light trucks (-4.0%) fell again in November. Exports of engines and parts (-4.4%) were also down, coinciding with lower motor vehicle production in the United States. Exports of forestry products and building and packaging materials (-6.2%) also declined in November. This was primarily the result of lower exports of lumber (-11.6%), which were down mainly on lower prices. After months of rising prices that peaked in September, lumber prices stabilized in October and then decreased in November. However, these prices remained significantly higher in November compared with May, when the increase began. Following two months of growth, imports of industrial machinery fall Total imports decreased 0.3% in November to $50.1 billion, which was still above pre-pandemic levels. This was the first decline after five consecutive months of growth. In real (or volume) terms, imports were down 0.7%. Chart 4 Contribution to the monthly change in imports, by product, November 2020 Imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts decreased 3.9% in November to $5.3 billion—the second decline in seven months. Since the 21.3% decrease in April, imports of industrial machinery and equipment have increased 28.0%. The decrease in imports of other general-purpose machinery and equipment (-6.8%) contributed the most to the decline this month. In October, high-value shipments of wind turbines from China related to a new wind farm project were observed. These shipments were not repeated in November. Chart 5 Canadian imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts Imports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals decreased 11.0% in November. Despite the monthly decline, imports of this product section were already up by 5.9% in 2020 compared with the full year of 2019. Both the monthly decrease and annual growth were attributable primarily to imports of other metal ores and concentrates—a category composed largely of gold for refining purposes. This month's decrease in imports of other metal ores and concentrates (-23.2%) was mainly the result of lower imports of gold from Peru. These decreases were partially offset by higher imports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts (+16.2%). Imports of aircraft led the increase, in part because of two new airliners imported from Ireland. Imports of aircraft have been affected heavily by the pandemic. So far in 2020, the value of these imports has decreased 39.0% compared with the same period in 2019—a year affected by supply issues resulting from the grounding of some airliners. Exports to non-US countries reach a record on higher exports of gold The divergent trend between Canada's trade with the United States versus Canada's trade with other countries continued in November. Total trade with countries other than the United States was up 2.1% in November, reaching a record $33.1 billion. Total trade with the United States decreased 1.0% to $63.8 billion—the lowest level since June. While total trade with countries other than the United States was up $3.4 billion in November compared with February, total trade with the United States was $4.8 billion below the levels observed that month. A significant part of that gap is the result of lower exports and imports of energy products. In November, exports to countries other than the United States rose 7.4%, a sixth increase in the last seven months. The United Kingdom was by far the largest contributor to the growth in Canada's exports to non-US countries—the result of higher exports of refined gold. Imports from countries other than the United States were down 1.3% in November. Imports from Peru, South Korea and Germany saw the largest decreases. After reaching a record high in October, imports from China remained high, despite falling 2.1% on lower imports of wind turbines. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States narrowed from $6.9 billion in October to $5.7 billion in November. Exports to the United States fell 2.2% in November, while imports edged up 0.3%. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States narrowed from $3.1 billion in October to $2.3 billion in November. Chart 6 Canada's imports and exports with the United States and countries other than the United States When the average exchange rates of October and November are compared, the Canadian dollar gained 0.8 cents US relative to the American dollar, reaching its highest level (76.5 cents US) since October 2018. Chart 7 International merchandise trade balance Revisions to October merchandise exports and imports data Imports in October, originally reported as $50.2 billion in the previous release, were revised to $50.3 billion in the current month's release. Exports in October, originally reported at $46.5 billion in the previous release, were essentially unchanged in the current month's release. Trade in medical and protective goods Following two consecutive monthly declines, imports of medical and protective goods increased 6.7% in November to $3.3 billion on a customs basis. Higher imports of diagnostic products (+35.4%) and medical equipment and products (+8.8%) were moderated by lower imports of personal protective equipment (-8.9%) and disinfectant and sterilization products (-14.8%). Year over year, imports of medical and protective goods were up 46.3%. Meanwhile, exports of medical and protective goods decreased 8.3% to $1.4 billion in November because of lower exports of medical equipment and products (-8.9%). Much of the monthly fluctuation in imports of diagnostic products, as well as imports and exports of medical equipment and products, resulted from variations in trade unrelated to COVID-19. Monthly trade in services In November, monthly service exports were up 1.0% to $9.4 billion, and service imports edged down 0.1% to $9.3 billion. When international trade in goods and services are combined, exports increased 0.6% to $56.2 billion in November, while imports fell 0.3% to $59.4 billion. As a result, Canada's trade deficit with the world for goods and services combined was $3.2 billion in November.

International trade data by commodity are available on both a BOP and customs basis. International trade data by country are available on a customs basis for all countries, and on a BOP basis for Canada's 27 principal trading partners (PTPs). The list of PTPs is based on their annual share of total merchandise trade—imports and exports—with Canada in 2012. BOP data are derived from customs data by adjusting for factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions of the Canadian System of National Accounts. For a conceptual analysis of BOP-based data versus customs-based data, see ""Balance of Payments trade in goods at Statistics Canada: Expanding geographic detail to 27 principal trading partners."" For more information on these and other macroeconomic concepts, see the Methodological Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-607-X) and the User Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-606-G). The data in this release are on a BOP basis and are seasonally adjusted. Unless otherwise stated, values are expressed in nominal terms, or current dollars. References to prices are based on aggregate Paasche (current-weighted) price indexes (2012=100). Movements within aggregate Paasche prices can be influenced by changes in the share of values traded for specific goods, with sudden shifts in trading patterns—as observed currently with the pandemic—sometimes resulting in large movements in Paasche price indexes. Volumes, or constant dollars, are calculated using the Laspeyres formula (2012=100), unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Revisions In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current-year revisions are reflected in both the customs-based and BOP-based data. The previous year's customs-based data are revised with the release of data for the January and February reference months, and thereafter on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs-based data are revised annually, and revisions are released in February with the December reference month. The previous year's BOP-based data are revised with the release of data for the January, February, March and April reference months. To remain consistent with the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts, revisions to BOP-based data for previous years are released annually in December with the October reference month. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of import and export documentation, incorrect information on customs forms, the replacement of estimates produced for the energy section with actual figures, changes in merchandise classification based on more current information, and changes to seasonal adjustment factors. For information on data revisions for exports of energy products, see Methodology for Exports of Energy Products within the International Merchandise Trade Program. Revised data are available in the appropriate tables. Real-time data table The real-time data table 12-10-0120-01 will be updated on January 18.

Participating health care workers who worked in direct contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 and those who experienced restrictions or conditions on the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) were more affected than others. These findings come from a new crowdsourcing initiative, Impacts of COVID-19 on Health Care Workers: Infection Prevention and Control, developed by Statistics Canada in collaboration with Health Canada, the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Public Health Agency of Canada. A previous study from Statistics Canada has shown that Canadian adults (aged 18 and older) reported lower self-perceived mental health than before the pandemic. Health care workers face particular challenges because of an increased risk of infection, high workloads affecting work–life balance, and issues involving the supply of PPE. The current initiative was developed to examine these issues by gathering information from health care workers about their health, mental health and work environment. Approximately 18,000 health care workers from the provinces and territories filled out the crowdsourcing questionnaire, which was open for completion from November 24 to December 13, 2020. Health care workers include workers who provide health care services directly to individuals, technical support to medical staff, and support services within a health care setting. Given that this crowdsourcing initiative did not involve sample selection, findings cannot be used to make inferences about the overall population of health care workers in Canada. One-third of participating health care workers report fair or poor mental health The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that health care workers may be at increased risk of mental health impacts because of a number of factors, such as increased risk of exposure and demanding working conditions. Eight months into the global pandemic, one-third (33%) of participating health care workers reported fair or poor mental health, one-third (33%) reported good mental health, and one-third (33%) reported very good or excellent mental health. Most participating health care workers (70%) reported that their mental health was ""somewhat worse now"" or ""much worse now"" compared with before March 2020. In addition, when asked to choose between five levels indicating how stressful most days were, 56% chose one of the two highest levels, reporting that most days were ""quite a bit stressful"" or ""extremely stressful."" Three-quarters of health care workers working in direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases report worsening mental health Some health care workers are at disproportionate risk of infection because of the nature of their job. Among crowdsourcing participants, 40% reported working in direct contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19; most of these workers were nurses (41%), followed by other health professionals (31%) and personal support workers or care aides (12%). Over three-quarters (77%) of health care workers who reported working in direct contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 reported worsening mental health compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast, among health care workers who did not work in direct contact with people, 62% reported that their mental health was somewhat or much worse than before the pandemic. In addition, a higher proportion (63%) of those working in direct contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 reported that their days were quite a bit or extremely stressful, compared with 44% of participants who did not work in direct contact with people. A higher proportion of those working in direct contact also rated their mental health as fair or poor (40% vs. 29%). Access to appropriate personal protective equipment is associated with better self-reported mental health and lower stress levels Appropriate PPE—such as masks, face shields and N95 respirators—is essential for reducing infection risk. For the month before they participated in the crowdsourcing initiative, which took place from late November to mid December 2020, 47% of health care workers reported that they did not have any restrictions or conditions on the supply of PPE. However, 31% of participants reported that they extended the use of PPE beyond normal practice, 18% were required to reuse PPE they had previously worn without decontamination, and 11% needed to supply their own PPE. Almost one-third (30%) reported that their access to PPE was subject to some restrictions, such as requiring permission to access PPE. These reported PPE access restrictions could be attributable to a combination of inventory control measures put in place by health care settings and ongoing shortages in the supply of PPE. Health care workers citing no restrictions or conditions on the supply of PPE reported better mental health and stress outcomes than participants who experienced restrictions or conditions. For example, a lower proportion of health care workers with unrestricted access to PPE reported worsening mental health, compared with those who experienced at least one restriction (63% vs. 77%). Similarly, while 49% of workers with unrestricted access to PPE indicated that most of their days were quite a bit or extremely stressful, 63% of participants with restricted access to PPE reported the same. Chart 1 Mental health and stress outcomes, participating health care workers with and without restrictions in supply of personal protective equipment in month previous to crowdsourcing initiative, proportion (%), Canada Table 1 Self-reported mental health and stress levels of participating health care workers, proportion (%), Canada Note to readers This article is based on the crowdsourcing initiative Impact of COVID-19 on Health Care Workers: Infection Prevention and Control. Health care workers were invited to complete the online questionnaire between November 24 and December 13, 2020. Health care workers and those working in a health care setting living in the provinces and territories were eligible to participate. This includes people who provide health care services directly to individuals (e.g., physicians, nurses, massage therapists, dentists, dietitians), provide technical support to medical staff (e.g., receptionists, technicians) or provide support services in a health care setting (e.g., cleaning and food services staff, security). The results featured in this article are based on health care workers who have worked since March 2020. Results pertain to those who participated in the crowdsourcing initiative and are not representative of all health care workers in Canada. Methodological adjustments have been made to account for differences in the distribution of occupations and province or territory of residence between the crowdsourcing participants and the population of health care workers in Canada, based on the 2016 Census.

This compares to the findings from the 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) when 68% of Canadians aged 15 and older said that their mental health was excellent or very good (Chart 1)Note . Women in particular were more likely to report poorer mental health as compared to men. About half of women said that their mental health was excellent or very good (49% compared to 60% of men). In 2018, women were also less likely than men to report excellent or very good mental health although the difference was not as large (66% compared to 71% for men). More Canadians reported that their physical health was excellent or very good – 69% of Canadians compared to 60% in 2018. It is possible that during a pandemic, people who are not ill are more apt to report relatively better health, that is, have a positive perception of their own health. Data table for Chart 1 ﻿ Data table for Chart 1 Table summary This table displays the results of Data table for Chart 1 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and 2020 Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS), calculated using percent of Canadians units of measure (appearing as column headers). 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2020 Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) percent of Canadians Perceived health, very good or excellent 60.2 68.6 Perceived mental health, very good or excellent 68.2 54.0 Sources: Statistics Canada, 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey and 2020 Canadian Perspectives Survey Series. Youth are less likely to report excellent or very good mental health All age groups except individuals aged 65 and older were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 period. However, the difference between 2018 and 2020 was particularly evident for younger adults (Chart 2). For example, among those aged 15 to 24, 42% reported excellent or very good mental health during the pandemic compared to 62% in 2018. In contrast, those aged 65 and older who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 reported similar rates of excellent/very good mental health on the CPSS as compared to 2018 CCHS (71% vs. 72%, respectively). It is important to note that the CPSS was not conducted in long-term care residences or in remote areas with low population density; therefore, the findings should be interpreted accordingly. Data table for Chart 2 ﻿ Data table for Chart 2 Table summary This table displays the results of Data table for Chart 2 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and 2020 Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS), calculated using percent of Canadians units of measure (appearing as column headers). 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2020 Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) percent of Canadians Total, 15 years and over 68.2 54.0 15 to 24 years 62.1 41.5 25 to 34 years 66.1 47.1 35 to 44 years 68.9 46.4 45 to 54 years 67.6 49.8 55 to 64 years 70.4 61.9 65 years and over 72.2 71.2 Sources: 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey and 2020 Canadian Perspectives Survey Series. These results suggest that Canadians’ overall mental health has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women and young Canadians’ self-perceived mental health was particularly impacted based on comparisons between the 2020 CPSS and the 2018 CCHS. Researchers have suggested that a variety of mental health interventions, including digital and tele-mental health resources while physically distancing, may be an option for meeting some of the mental health needs of the population in response to COVID-19 (Holmes et al., 2020). Results suggesting that Canadians rated their physical health more positively during the pandemic warrant further exploration. Methodology There is a large body of evidence to suggest that mental health can be negatively affected by adverse events such as natural disasters (North et al., 2013) and health epidemics (Lau et al., 2010), although the impact on self-perceived physical health is less clear. Early results from other countries have shown a psychological impact related to COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020). Subgroups of the population have been shown to be particularly at risk for poorer mental health, including women (Furr et al., 2010) and youth (Kar & Bastia, 2006). This article examined the self-perceived mental and physical health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and reports differences between women and men and for different age groups. This article is based on two data sources. First, to get timely information about how Canadians are coping with COVID-19, Statistics Canada developed a web panel survey, the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1: Impacts of COVID 19 (CPSS). More than 4,600 people in the 10 provinces responded to this survey between March 29th and April 3rd, 2020. Second, the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2018 was used to compare Canadians’ self-perceived health prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. The CCHS covers the population aged 12 and older in the 10 provinces and 3 territories, with approximately 65,000 respondents annually. In order to align with the sample of the CPSS, only those aged 15 and older and living in the 10 provinces were included in the analyses for this article. References Furr, J. M., Comer, J.

However, when compared with Canadian youth 20 years ago, they are more obese, less active and eat fewer servings of fruit and vegetables. These findings are from the first chapter, ""Health of youth in Canada,"" of Portrait of Youth in Canada: Data Report, a brand-new publication that will highlight what is known about Canadian youth. In the next few months, Portrait of Youth in Canada will focus on themes such as demographics, employment, education, social engagement and well-being, the environment, and Indigenous youth. The first chapter also reveals worse mental health for Canada's youth, in comparison both with older Canadians (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic) and with youths 20 years ago. Physical health and behaviours In 2019, about 70% of males and 66% of females aged 15 to 30 reported excellent or very good general health. This is higher than for males (47%) and females (53%) aged 47 and older. In addition, compared with older Canadians, Canadian youth had lower daily smoking rates and obesity rates. Youth were also more active. Compared with previous years, Canadian youth daily smoking rates continuously declined, from 26% in 2001 to 8% in 2019 for males and from 22% to 6% for females. However, obesity slightly increased, from 9.6% to 11.8% for males and from 7.0% to 11.7% for females, during the same period. Income and belonging to a group designated as a visible minority remain key social determinants among Canadian youth. In 2019, smoking rates were 22% for males living in a household in the lowest income quintile, compared with 15% for males living in the highest income quintile. The corresponding figures were 18% and 8% for females. Young Canadians belonging to a group designated as a visible minority smoke less and have lower obesity rates than White Canadians. However, those belonging to a group designated as a visible minority spend less time, on average, doing active recreational activities and eat less fruit and vegetables than White Canadians. Mental health A decade ago, young Canadians reported more positive mental health than their older counterparts. In 2011/2012, for example, 74% of females aged 15 to 30 reported excellent or very good mental health, compared with 69% of females aged 47 and older. However, this picture has reversed since then, and, in 2019, a lower proportion of Canadian youth reported having excellent or very good mental health than older Canadians. The difference was essentially driven by young females: 54% reported excellent or very good mental health, compared to 69% of females aged 47 and older. While the mental health of Canadian youth has declined over the last few years, the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of youth was the largest of any age group. In the summer of 2020, less than half of youth aged 15 to 30 reported excellent or very good mental health (40%). Moreover, youth were the most likely to report a negative impact on their mental health since physical distancing began, while seniors were the least likely to do so. Substance use In 2019, heavy drinking and cannabis use in the past 12 months were higher among Canadian youth than among older Canadians. The general trend shows that heavy drinking has likely declined among males aged 15 to 30 over the last 20 years and likely increased among females in the same age group. Heavy drinking and cannabis use are more frequent among White Canadians than among Canadians belonging to a population group designated as a visible minority. Heavy drinking was reported by 29% of White Canadians, as opposed to 16% of Canadians belonging to a group designated as a visible minority. Cannabis use by White Canadians (41%) was almost double that of Canadians belonging to a group designated as a visible minority (23%). Note to readers Most of the data highlighted in this study come from the various cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey. This information is supplemented with data and findings from published research papers and reports from the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.7% in November, following a 0.4% increase in October. This seventh consecutive monthly gain continued to offset the drops in March and April in Canadian economic activity, which were the steepest on record. However, total economic activity was about 3% below the pre-pandemic level in February. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product grows in November Both goods-producing (+1.2%) and services-producing (+0.5%) industries were up, as 14 of 20 industrial sectors posted gains in November. Preliminary information indicates an approximate 0.3% increase in real GDP for December. The public sector, real estate and rental and leasing and the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector all contributed to growth, while retail, accommodation and food services, and wholesale declined. This flash estimate points to an approximate 1.9% increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to an approximate decline of 5.1% for the year. Owing to their preliminary nature, these estimates will be revised on March 2, 2021, with the release of the official GDP data for December and the fourth quarter. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector grows The mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector grew 3.9% in November on the strength of all of its three subsectors. Chart 2 Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector grows in November Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) rose 6.1% as all types of mining and quarrying activities expanded in November, spurred by higher international demand. Non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying jumped 13.9% as both potash mining (+26.7%) and other non-metallic mineral mining (except potash) (+9.5%) rose in November. Metal ore mining grew 3.3% as increases in copper, nickel, lead and zinc (+6.0%), iron ore (+3.4%) and gold and silver ore mining (+1.4%) all contributed to the growth, fuelled by higher international demand for these commodities. Coal mining increased 3.8% in November, nearly reaching the activity level recorded in March. Oil and gas extraction expanded 1.7% in November, up for the third consecutive month. Oil sands extraction rose 5.3%, driven by higher synthetic oil production in Alberta as a number of facilities restarted production. Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) contracted 2.1% as a result of declines in both oil extraction and natural gas extraction. Support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction grew 14.0% in November as all types of support activities were up in the month. This was the subsector's fifth consecutive monthly increase, following four consecutive declines in the first half of the year. Despite the gains, the subsector's output was about 41% below the pre-pandemic level in February. Manufacturing sector grows Following a 0.5% contraction in October, the manufacturing sector grew 1.7% in November, largely as a result of higher inventory formation. Both durable and non-durable manufacturing were up. This was the sixth increase in seven months, bringing the sector's output to within 3% of its pre-pandemic level of activity. Durable manufacturing rose 2.0%, led by fabricated metal products (+7.1%), machinery manufacturing (+3.8%) and non-metallic mineral product manufacturing (+5.6%). Transportation equipment, down for the second consecutive month, decreased 1.3% as the majority of industries were down. Non-durable manufacturing was up 1.3% in November as all subsectors, with the exception of chemical manufacturing (-0.8%), were up. Contributing most to growth were plastics and rubber products (+4.1%), petroleum and coal product (+3.0%), paper (+3.0) and beverage and tobacco (+2.7%) manufacturing. Finance and insurance sector continues to grow Finance and insurance increased 1.3% in November on widespread growth across all subsectors. As market sentiments improved, following multiple global COVID-19 vaccine announcements, activity in equity and mutual funds markets drove increased activity on the Toronto Stock Exchange in November. Chart 3 Finance and insurance sector grows in November Foreign investment in Canadian securities, through acquisition of Canadian shares in secondary markets and purchases of federal government securities, rose to their highest levels in months. At the same time, households' mortgage debt grew, expanding 7.4% year over year in November. All of these developments contributed to a 3.5% gain in financial investment services, funds and other financial vehicles and a 1.1% expansion in depository credit intermediation and monetary authorities. Insurance carriers and related activities were up for the seventh consecutive month, increasing 0.6% in November. Retail continues to grow The retail trade sector grew 1.1% in November as 8 of 12 subsectors were up. Food and beverage (+6.1%) led the growth as higher activity at supermarkets and other grocery stores, along with beer, wine and liquor stores, contributed to the increase. Building material and garden equipment and supplies (+3.4%) grew for the fourth consecutive month, and non-store retailers rose 3.1% following two months of decline. Clothing and clothing accessories stores (-5.4%), and health and personal care stores (-1.8%) offset some of the growth, as did motor vehicle and parts dealers, which contracted 0.6% following six months of growth. Wholesale resumes growth The wholesale trade sector was up 1.0% in November as seven of nine subsectors contributed to the growth. This was the sector's sixth expansion in seven months, and it fully offset the declines recorded in March and April. Machinery, equipment and supplies wholesaling (+2.8%) led the growth as the majority of industries were up, following high levels of exports and imports of machinery in previous months. Motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories wholesaling was down 1.8% as lower production and international trade of passenger cars and light trucks contributed to the decline. Public sector grows The public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) grew 0.3% in November, as two out of three components were up. Health care services rose 0.7% as a continued increase in ambulatory health care services (+1.8%) more than offset a 0.1% decrease in hospitals. Education was up 0.3%, led by a 0.8% gain in elementary and secondary schools. Public administration edged down 0.2% in November, following six months of growth. Transportation and warehousing sector grows The transportation and warehousing sector rose 1.4% in November, the third consecutive monthly increase, as all but one subsector grew. Air transportation (+41.8%) contributed most to the gain as passenger traffic and trips abroad by Canadian residents were up in November. Nevertheless, air transportation was about 84% below the January 2020 level. Rail transportation (+1.6%), and transit, ground passenger and scenic and sightseeing transportation (+2.1%) were up; pipeline transportation grew 1.0% as higher crude oil movement offset lower natural gas movement by pipelines. The warehousing and storage subsector was essentially unchanged in November. Other industries Professional services rose 0.6% in November as all types of services were up, led by increases in computer systems design and related services (+0.6%) and other professional services including research and development (+0.5%). Following a 1.9% decline in October, activity at the offices of real estate agents and brokers was down 2.6% in November. Housing resale activity decreased in the majority of Canadian urban centres, with Greater Toronto, Greater Vancouver, Montréal, Ottawa, Edmonton and Calgary contributing the most to the decline. Utilities declined 1.2% in November, as milder weather across many parts of the country reduced demand for electricity for heating purposes. Construction edged up 0.1% in November. Engineering and other construction activities increased 0.6% and repair activities edged up 0.1%. Partly offsetting these gains was a 0.9% decline in non-residential construction, while residential construction was unchanged in November. Accommodation and food services edged up 0.1%, as a 6.0% increase in accommodation services largely offset a 2.1% contraction in food services and drinking places. Chart 4 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product Table 1 Monthly gross domestic product by industry at basic prices in chained (2012) dollars – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The release on gross domestic product by industry is an example of how Statistics Canada supports global sustainable development goal reporting. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Monthly data on gross domestic product (GDP) by industry at basic prices are chained volume estimates with 2012 as the reference year. This means that the data for each industry and each aggregate are obtained from a chained volume index multiplied by the industry's value added in 2012. The monthly data are benchmarked to annually chained Fisher volume indexes of GDP obtained from the constant-price supply and use tables (SUTs) up to the latest SUT year (2017). For the period starting in January 2018, data are derived by chaining a fixed-weight Laspeyres volume index to the prior period. The fixed weights are 2017 industry prices. This approach makes the monthly GDP by industry data more comparable with expenditure-based GDP data, which are chained quarterly. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Revisions With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions have been made back to January 2020. Each month, newly available administrative and survey data from various industries in the economy are integrated, resulting in statistical revisions. Updated and revised administrative data (including taxation statistics), new information provided by respondents to industry surveys, and standard changes to seasonal adjustment calculations are incorporated with each release. Real-time table Real-time table 36-10-0491-01 will be updated on February 8, 2021. Next release Data on GDP by industry for December 2020 will be released on March 2, 2021.

Unfilled orders $85.5 billion November 2020 -3.6% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 16-10-0047-01. Manufacturing sales decreased for the first time in three months, declining 0.6% to $53.7 billion in November. Sales were down in 5 of 21 industries, driven mainly by the aerospace product and parts, motor vehicle, and motor vehicle parts industries. Chart 1 Manufacturing sales Manufacturing sales in constant dollars decreased 0.6%, indicating that a lower volume of goods was sold in November. Transportation equipment drives the decline Sales in the transportation equipment industry decreased 9.1% to $8.9 billion in November, following a 0.8% decline in October. Sales rose in the motor vehicle body and trailer industry (+5.9%) and declined in all of the other transportation equipment industries. Aerospace production fell 23.8% to $1.2 billion in November, following a 5.5% decrease in October. Travel restrictions and market uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively affect aerospace production in November. On a year-over-year basis, production was down 45.5%. Following a 1.7% increase in October, motor vehicle sales decreased 5.7% to $4.3 billion in November. Sales were 10.0% below their pre-pandemic levels in February and down 16.9% year over year. Sales of motor vehicle parts declined 6.0% to $2.5 billion in November and were down 9.7% year over year. Exports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 4.1% in November. Following six consecutive monthly increases, wood product manufacturing sales declined 4.1% to $3.3 billion in November on lower sales in the sawmills and wood preservation industry. The decline was driven mainly by lower prices for lumber and other wood products (-10.7%). Despite the decrease in November, sales in the wood product industry were 32.0% above February levels and up 42.1% year over year. Export of forestry products and building and packaging materials declined 6.2% in November. Sales in the non-durable goods industries rose 1.5% to $25.4 billion in November, mainly because of higher sales in the petroleum and coal product industry. Sales of petroleum and coal products rose 5.3% to $4.0 billion in November, the second consecutive monthly increase. Higher energy and petroleum product prices (+4.0%) in November explain the growth. Nevertheless, sales in November were 26.8% lower compared with February because of the slow recovery in global demand in the wake of pandemic-related shutdowns and travel bans. Sales of petroleum and coal product manufacturing in constant dollars decreased 0.2% in November. Following a 1.7% decline in October, sales in the fabricated metal product industry rose 3.4% to $3.3 billion in November. Excluding October, sales of fabricated metal products have been trending upward since May. In November, sales rose in the food (+0.9%), chemical (+1.7%), non-metallic mineral product (+5.3%), and computer and electronic product (+4.4%) industries. Sales down in six provinces, led by Ontario and British Columbia Manufacturing sales declined in six provinces in November, led by Ontario and British Columbia. Alberta and New Brunswick posted the largest gains. Following a 0.2% decline in October, sales in Ontario decreased 0.8% to $25.1 billion in November on lower sales of transportation equipment (-8.1%). Sales declined in most transportation equipment industries in Ontario; decreases were most pronounced in the motor vehicle (-5.4%), motor vehicle parts (-6.4%) and aerospace product and parts (-31.7%) industries. On a year-over-year basis, total manufacturing sales in Ontario were down 3.9%. Following six consecutive monthly gains, sales in British Columbia fell 4.2% to $4.5 billion in November on lower sales of wood products and paper. Sales in the wood product industry were down 8.7%, following five consecutive monthly gains, primarily on lower prices. Sales in the paper industry fell 21.1%, following four consecutive monthly increases. Despite the declines, total manufacturing sales in British Columbia were up 4.8% year over year. In Alberta, sales increased 1.4% to $5.5 billion, the third consecutive monthly increase, on higher sales of petroleum and coal products (+7.5%), machinery (+10.3%), and chemicals (+2.9%). In spite of the increases, total manufacturing sales in Alberta were down 8.5% year over year. Sales in New Brunswick rose 5.0% to $1.5 billion in November, on higher sales in non-durable goods industries. Despite the increase, total manufacturing sales in the province were 15.9% below the same month a year earlier. Montréal and Toronto lead sales decline among selected census metropolitan areas Manufacturing sales on an unadjusted basis were down in 9 of the 12 selected census metropolitan areas in November, led by Montréal and Toronto. Ottawa–Gatineau posted the largest gain. Following a 1.8% decline in October, sales in Montréal decreased 5.2% to $6.0 billion in November, mostly on lower sales in the primary metal industry and a production decline in the aerospace product and parts industry. This brought year-over-year sales in Montréal 11.2% below those of November 2019. In Toronto, sales decreased 1.4% to $10.6 billion in November, on lower sales in the food (-3.0%), aerospace product and parts (-13.6%), and motor vehicle parts (-4.8%) industries. Sales in Ottawa–Gatineau rose 1.7% to $713.6 million in November, following two consecutive monthly declines, on higher sales in the miscellaneous (+7.1%) and computer and electronic product (+10.8%) industries. Inventory levels rise Following a 0.4% decline in October, total inventories rose 0.8% to $87.1 billion in November. Inventories increased in 17 of 21 industries. The largest contributors to the monthly increase were the fabricated metal product (+7.2%), machinery (+3.4%) and food (+1.8%) industries. Chart 2 Inventory levels rise The aerospace product and parts industry (-4.7%) posted the largest decline in November. Total inventory levels in that month were 0.6% lower than their pre-pandemic levels in February and were down 1.0% year over year. The inventory-to-sales ratio increased from 1.60 in October to 1.62 in November. This ratio measures the time, in months, that would be required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain at their current level. Chart 3 The inventory-to-sales ratio increases Unfilled orders decrease to lowest level since January 2018 Following a 3.2% decline in October, unfilled orders were down 3.6% to $85.5 billion in November, primarily attributable to lower unfilled orders of aerospace products and parts (-7.7%). Order cancellations and a slowdown in new orders because of the pandemic and travel restrictions brought the total value of unfilled orders to its lowest level since January 2018. Chart 4 Unfilled orders decline The total value of new orders decreased 1.2% to $50.4 billion in November, following a 5.7% decline in October, mainly on lower new orders in the transportation equipment industry (-34.6%). Year over year, the total value of new orders decreased 10.0%. Capacity utilization rate decreases The capacity utilization rate (not seasonally adjusted) for the total manufacturing sector decreased from 78.3% in October to 77.7% in November on lower production. Chart 5 The capacity utilization rate decreases Capacity utilization rates were down in the non-metallic mineral product (-3.9 percentage points), fabricated metal product (-3.2 percentage points), and plastics and rubber products (-3.2 percentage points) industries. These declines were partially offset by increased capacity utilization rates in the printing and related support activities (+3.1 percentage points), paper (+1.6 percentage points), and petroleum and coal product (+1.4 percentage points) industries.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Monthly Survey of Manufacturing is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers While the quality of this month's data remains high, response rates from manufacturers have fallen from the usual 95% to a rate of 88.8% in November. Every effort has been made to supplement this month's data with information from other sources. Monthly data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing, leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics and rubber products. Durable goods industries include wood products; non-metallic mineral products; primary metals; fabricated metal products; machinery; computer and electronic products; electrical equipment, appliances and components; transportation equipment; furniture and related products; and miscellaneous manufacturing. Production-based industries For the aerospace and ship building industries, the value of production is used instead of the value of sales of goods manufactured. The value of production is calculated by adjusting monthly sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories of goods in process and finished products manufactured. The value of production is used because of the extended period of time that it normally takes to manufacture products in these industries. Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled. New orders are those received, whether sold in the current month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the previous month to the current month. Manufacturers reporting sales, inventories and unfilled orders in US dollars Some Canadian manufacturers report sales, inventories and unfilled orders in US dollars. These data are then converted to Canadian dollars as part of the data production cycle. For sales, based on the assumption that they occur throughout the month, the average monthly exchange rate for the reference month established by the Bank of Canada is used for the conversion. The monthly average exchange rate is available in table 33-10-0163-01. Inventories and unfilled orders are reported at the end of the reference period. For most respondents, the daily average exchange rate on the last working day of the month is used for the conversion of these variables. However, some manufacturers choose to report their data as of a day other than the last working day of the month. In these instances, the daily average exchange rate on the day selected by the respondent is used. Note that because of exchange rate fluctuations, the daily average exchange rate on the day selected by the respondent can differ from both the exchange rate on the last working day of the month and the monthly average exchange rate. Daily average exchange rate data are available in table 33-10-0036-01. Revision policy Each month, the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing releases preliminary data for the reference month and revised data for the three previous months. Revisions are made to reflect new information provided by respondents and updates to administrative data. Once a year, a revision project is undertaken to revise multiple years of data. Real-time data tables Real-time data tables 16-10-0118-01, 16-10-0119-01, 16-10-0014-01 and 16-10-0015-01 will be updated on January 26. Next release Data from the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing for December will be released on February 15.

This was the seventh consecutive monthly gain. The increase was led by higher sales at food and beverage stores, along with an uptick in e-commerce sales. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—rose 2.6% on higher sales at food and beverage (+5.9%) and general merchandise (+1.6%) stores, as well as building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.2%). Sales were up in 7 of 11 subsectors, representing 53.4% of retail trade. In volume terms, retail sales rose 1.2% in November. Because of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in Canada, government officials began to reintroduce physical distancing measures, which directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, approximately 3% of retailers were closed during November. The average length of the shutdown was one business day. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 2.6% in December. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 59% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 87.1%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in November Lower sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers In November, sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers (-0.9%) declined for the first time since April. Sales were down at three out of four store types, led by new car dealers (-1.0%). New motor vehicle sales were down 6.7% year over year in dollar terms in November. Sales of trucks, an aggregate group that includes light trucks, heavy trucks and buses, decreased 4.0% year over year, while passenger car sales (-20.5%) were down by one-fifth. Nevertheless, new motor vehicle sales were up 7.6% compared with pre-pandemic levels (February 2020). Sales at gasoline stations (-1.6%) declined for the second consecutive month. In volume terms, sales were down 2.2%. Increase in core retail sales led by food and beverage stores Core retail sales (+2.6%) rose for the fourth consecutive month in November. The growth was led by food and beverage stores (+5.9%), specifically supermarkets and other grocery (except convenience) stores (+6.5%). General merchandise stores (+1.6%) reported higher sales in November, following a 0.5% decline in October. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+2.2%) rose for the fourth consecutive month. Clothing and clothing accessories store (-3.0%) sales fell for the second month in a row, with all three store types reporting declines, led by clothing stores (-2.8%). Chart 2 Sales up in 7 of 11 subsectors Sales up in nine provinces Sales rose in nine provinces in November, led by higher sales in Quebec and Ontario. In Quebec, sales increased 2.0%, with the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montréal up 1.5%. Sales in Ontario (+0.9%) rose for the seventh consecutive month. In the CMA of Toronto, sales rose 0.3%. The increase in sales in both provinces were driven by food and beverage stores. The increase in New Brunswick (+6.0%) was due to higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Manitoba (-3.1%) was the sole province reporting a decline, on lower sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores. Retail e-commerce sales surge On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached $4.3 billion in November, accounting for 7.4% of total retail trade—the largest share since May. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales (7.4%) rose 2.0 percentage points from October and was up 3.0 percentage points year over year. The rise in sales coincided with retailers urging online shoppers to buy early to avoid shipping delays, as well as promotional events such as Black Friday. Retail e-commerce sales were up by three-quarters (+75.9%) year over year in November, while total unadjusted retail sales increased 5.8%. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce increased 2.7%.

Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate for retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are the exact same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. For information regarding cannabis statistics, consult the Cannabis Stats Hub. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they too are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

November data are now available from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), which provides monthly information on payroll employment, earnings and hours worked in Canada, the provinces and territories. SEPH provides an account of payroll employment, that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. Preliminary monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are also now available for November. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), data from SEPH and JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions. Payroll employment declines in November Payroll employment fell 79,500 (-0.5%) in November—the first decline since May. The total number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer was down 1.1 million (-6.6%) compared with February. The November Labour Force Survey (LFS)—for the week of November 8 to 14—recorded an increase of 55,000 (+0.3%) in the number of people with a job or business. Chart 1 First payroll employment decline after five-month-long recovery Payroll employment down in four provinces As adjustments to tighter public health measures continued in November, payroll employment fell in four provinces: Manitoba (-1.7%; -9,700), Quebec (-1.2%; -42,900), Alberta (-0.7%; -12,500) and Ontario (-0.4%; -25,300), reflecting the impact of these measures. At the same time, increases were observed in Prince Edward Island (+0.7%; +400) and British Columbia (+0.4%; +7,800), while there was little change in the remaining provinces. In early November, restrictions related to indoor dining and fitness facilities were eased in Ontario. Later in the month, however, the regions of Peel and Toronto were moved from ""Red Control"" level to ""Lockdown,"" with indoor and outdoor dining services, personal care services, and indoor sports and recreational facilities required to close. In Manitoba, the province was moved to ""critical level red"" on November 12 and new measures affecting restaurants, recreational facilities and retail businesses were implemented. Much of Quebec remained at the ""red"" alert level in November, leading to the ongoing closure of indoor dining and many recreational and cultural facilities. In Alberta, targeted measures introduced on November 24 required the closure of many entertainment and recreation facilities, but not in-person dining services. Hourly paid employees account for all of the payroll employment decline in November The decline in payroll employment in November was entirely attributable to hourly paid employees (-1.0%; -86,600). Hourly paid employees tend to earn significantly less than salaried employees. In February 2020, for example, salaried employees earned an average of $1,410 per week, while hourly paid employees earned an average of $800 per week. In November, the number of hourly paid employees was 8.7% below its pre-COVID level, compared with 3.7% below the pre-COVID level for salaried employees. In May, the number of hourly paid employees was 25.5% below its pre-COVID level, compared with 7.8% below the pre-COVID level for salaried employees. Average weekly earnings up as lower-paid employees post larger share of job losses Average weekly earnings were $1,110 in November, up 0.6% compared with October. This brought the year-over-year increase in earnings to 6.6%, as job losses since February have been concentrated among hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees. Little change in both total and average hours worked Total hours worked were little changed in November, and were 5.5% below the pre-COVID level. By comparison, during the recent low in May, total hours worked were 16.6% below the February level. Average hours worked per week were little changed in November at 33.5 hours, a level at which the average has been hovering since July. In February, before COVID-19, payroll employees worked an average of 33.0 hours per week. Decline in payroll employment driven by losses in services-producing sector In November, payroll employment fell in the services-producing sector (-0.4%; -45,500), the first decline for this sector since May. Losses were largely concentrated in accommodation and food services (-48,200), with smaller declines in several other sectors, including arts, entertainment and recreation (-8,800) and transportation and warehousing (-6,700). Employment in the goods-producing sector was little changed. In November, payroll employment in the services-producing sector and the goods-producing sector was 6.8% and 4.7% below the pre-COVID level, respectively. Accommodation and food services post the largest decline in November Payroll employment in accommodation and food services fell by 48,200 (-4.7%) in November, the first decline since May. Most of the monthly decline was in full-service restaurants and limited-service eating places (-37,400), consistent with restrictions on indoor and outdoor dining in several provinces. The number of payroll employees also decreased notably in the traveller accommodation (-4,700) and drinking places (-4,400) industries. The monthly decline in accommodation and food services brought payroll employment to 27.8% below its February level, with employment in the drinking places industry declining by almost half (-48.0%) over that period. In November, all of the monthly decline in accommodation and food services was in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba, in line with ongoing public health measures in these provinces. As reported in the Daily release on food services and drinking places, sales in this subsector fell for a second consecutive month, down 3.7% to $4.5 billion in November. On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in accommodation and food services were little changed at $431. This sector has traditionally been the lowest paying among all industrial sectors. The vast majority of payroll employees in this sector are paid on an hourly basis. In 2019, almost 9 out of 10 (88.4%) payroll employees in accommodation and food services were hourly paid, compared with an average of 58.2% for all sectors. Chart 2 Impacts vary across accommodation and food services industries Employment declines in arts, entertainment and recreation as public health measures are tightened in several provinces In arts, entertainment and recreation, payroll employment fell by 8,800 (-3.9%) in November, the result of declines in the amusement, gambling and recreation industries subsector. Within the subsector, all of the losses were in the other amusement and recreation industries category, which includes skiing facilities as well as recreational, sports and fitness centres. The largest losses in this sector were observed in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba—four provinces where restrictions on public gatherings had been tightened and sports and fitness centres closed at some point during the month. Compared with February, payroll employment in arts, entertainment and recreation was down by 31.2% (-98,200), with all of the decline among hourly paid employees. Within the sector, payroll employment in the performing arts, spectator sports and related industries subsector continued to be the furthest from its pre-pandemic level in November (-48.0%; -30,700). In terms of numbers of payroll jobs, however, the largest decline from February to November was in the amusement, gambling and recreation industries subsector (-28.2%; -62,600). Average weekly earnings in arts, entertainment and recreation were $706 in November, up 13.7% compared with 12 months earlier. Payroll employment down in transportation and warehousing Following two months of strong growth, payroll employment in transportation and warehousing fell by 6,700 (-0.9%) in November. This brought payroll employment in the sector to 4.7% below the level in February, which was still above the low in May, when payroll employment was down 13.5% from February. Month over month, decreases were largest in warehousing and storage (-1,900;-3.0%), postal service (-1,700; -2.2%) and truck transportation (-1,500; -0.8%). On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in the transportation and warehousing sector grew 5.5% to $1,164. Health care and social assistance nearing pre-COVID level of employment Payroll employment in health care and social assistance rose for a sixth consecutive month, up 11,600 (+0.6%) in November, bringing the sector to within 0.2% of its pre-COVID level. In November, payroll employment was above the pre-COVID level in nursing and residential care facilities (+3.7% compared with February) and in ambulatory health care services (+2.9%), while it was below the February level in hospitals (-1.3%) and in social assistance (-7.6%). The gap between the November and February levels of employment in social assistance was largely due to individual and family services (which include, for example, services for the elderly and people with disabilities) and child day-care services, where, despite a gain in November, employment was still 9.4% and 9.8% below the pre-COVID level, respectively. Average weekly earnings in health care and social assistance were $1,012 in November, up 6.7% compared with 12 months earlier. Chart 3 Payroll employment above February level in nursing and residential care facilities and ambulatory health care services Payroll employment growth in construction stalls After six consecutive months of growth, payroll employment in construction was little changed in November, and was 4.4% below the pre-pandemic February level. At its lowest point in April, payroll employment in construction was 22.9% below its February level. As reported in the Daily release on investment in building construction, total investment in building construction declined for a third consecutive month, edging down 0.1% to $15.3 billion in November. In November, payroll employment in construction increased in Quebec (+1.2%; +2,600), Newfoundland and Labrador (+4.5%; +600), and Nova Scotia (+0.5%; +100). These gains were offset primarily by decreases in Alberta (-1.1%; -1,700), Ontario (-0.2%; -700), and Manitoba (-1.0%; -300). Average weekly earnings in the construction sector were $1,339 in November, up 4.8% compared with 12 months earlier. Payroll employment little changed in manufacturing Payroll employment in manufacturing was little changed in November, and was 4.8% below the level observed in February. In November, increases in food manufacturing (+0.7%; +1,700) and primary metal manufacturing (+2.2%; +1,200) were offset by declines in other subsectors and industries. In particular, payroll employment declined in aerospace product and parts (-5.6%; -2,600). According to Monthly Survey of Manufacturing data, aerospace production fell 23.8% in November, following a 5.5% decrease in October. Average weekly earnings in manufacturing were $1,175 in November, up 1.9% compared with 12 months earlier. Employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction furthest from recovery among goods-producing sectors Payroll employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction was little changed in November, and was further from full recovery than any other goods-producing sector, at 7.9% below the February level. The lag in recovery of payroll employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction was almost entirely driven by Alberta, which held half of the national payroll employment in this sector in February. In Alberta, payroll employment in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction has continued to trend downward since February, decreasing in November (-0.4%; -500) to 15.2% below the February level. In the rest of Canada (excluding Alberta), payroll employment in the sector had almost fully recovered and was 0.6% below the pre-COVID level in November, after falling 9.5% below its February level in May. Average weekly earnings in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction were $2,074 in November, little changed compared with 12 months earlier. Monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey In November, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 523,000 positions as they continued to navigate public health measures and the threat of COVID-19 (not seasonally adjusted). The job vacancy rate, which represents vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied) was 3.3% in November, following a rate of 3.5% in October (not seasonally adjusted). While monthly and quarterly job vacancy statistics are not directly comparable due to seasonal patterns and month-to-month variation within quarters, prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the quarterly job vacancy rate ranged from 3.0% to 3.5% between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. The job vacancy rate is a key measure of unmet labour demand and, in conjunction with other indicators such as payroll employment and the unemployment rate, it provides valuable insight into the labour market. For example, a high job vacancy rate could represent either an increased pace of recruiting, or difficulty on the part of employers in finding or retaining suitable candidates. Health care and social assistance has most vacancies and highest vacancy rate In November, the health care and social assistance sector accounted for more than one-fifth (112,700) of all job vacancies, and had a job vacancy rate of 5.2% (not seasonally adjusted). For reference, the job vacancy rate for this sector was 3.8% in October and ranged from 3.0% to 3.3% from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, payroll employment in health care and social assistance had been on a long-term upward trend. Since reaching a low in May, employment in the sector has been trending up, with most of the recent employment growth being in ambulatory health care services and social assistance. In November, the job vacancy rate was highest in Yukon (4.2%) and Quebec (4.0%) (not seasonally adjusted). The job vacancy rates were lowest in Saskatchewan (1.7%) and Manitoba (2.1%). The remaining provinces all posted job vacancy rates between 2.7% and 3.6%. Information on job vacancies will continue to be incorporated in future monthly releases of payroll estimates results. A more detailed analysis will be released with the quarterly estimates (October to December 2020) of the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey in March 2021. Looking ahead December SEPH results—to be released on February 25—will provide detailed information on the subsectors that continue to be most affected by the re-implementation and tightening of measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees, and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only, and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupations for Canada, the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wage and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable due to survey operations being temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates, and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. In addition, year-over-year comparisons between estimates of different frequencies (month vs quarter) should be interpreted with caution as job vacancy statistics can vary month to month within a quarter. While JVWS employment is calibrated to Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ due to calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period.

The number of exporting enterprises in Canada grew by 0.4% in November to reach 19,399, the highest level since February 2020. This increase was led by manufacturing exporters, a sector generally less affected by government restrictions than the services sector. Compared with the low in April, the total number of exporters in November had recovered by over 3,000 enterprises. Nonetheless, Canada still had nearly 1,000 fewer exporting enterprises (-4.8%) than were recorded in February, before the pandemic. Among all exporters, enterprises with fewer than 50 employees (small enterprises) were most affected by economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of small enterprises was down by 774 (-5.3%) from February, compared with a drop of 196 (-3.4%) among medium and large enterprises. However, in each month from May to September, small enterprises recovered faster than medium and large enterprises. Chart 1 Percentage change (month over month) in number of exporting enterprises, by enterprise employment size, March to November 2020 Change in number of exporters varies across provinces An enterprise can have multiple establishments located in different provinces or territories and operating in various industries. November's increase in the number of exporting establishments (+139) was concentrated in Quebec (+119) and Ontario (+63). For Quebec, the increase was the largest since June and was led by the manufacturing sector. The other two provinces whose exporter numbers rose were Saskatchewan and Alberta, with November being Alberta's seventh consecutive month of growth. The overall increase in exporters was attenuated by fewer exporters from British Columbia (-27) and the Atlantic region (-28), with that region's largest decline observed in New Brunswick. Nonetheless, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, along with Manitoba, were still above their pre-pandemic (February) level of exporters. More exporters to United States, fewer to China and Europe On a geographical basis, much of November's increase in exporters was from more enterprises selling to the United States, up by 0.8% to 15,991. Conversely, the number of enterprises exporting to China was down 3.8%, its largest decrease since February. In the context of several major European trading partners implementing a second round of lockdowns during the month of November, the number of enterprises exporting to the United Kingdom (-6.1%), France (-3.3%), Italy (-2.2%) and Germany (-2.2%) declined. However, the number of exporters to Spain (+6.8%) and the Netherlands (+3.2%) was up. Both destinations saw increases in the number of exporters from Ontario. The number of exporters to the Netherlands was above its level in February, before the pandemic (+6.1%). The Netherlands is an entry point for many Canadian goods, which may ultimately reach other European destinations. Chart 2 Change (month over month) in number of exporting enterprises, by major trading partner, October to November 2020 More firms in the professional, scientific and technical services sector export goods to Europe year over year In general, the effects of the pandemic were more pronounced for establishments in the services-producing sector. Firms in services-producing industries were particularly hard hit in exporting to the United States. The number of establishments in the services sector that exported to the United States was down 15.5% from November 2019, with the largest declines in wholesale trade; retail trade; and professional, scientific and technical services. Since April, the number of firms exporting to all major trading partner destinations in Europe has recovered at a faster rate than the number of firms exporting to the United States, with a strong resumption of export activity within the services sector, particularly for the United Kingdom. While some key industries within the services sector (wholesale trade and retail trade) posted year-over-year declines, the professional, scientific and technical services sector recorded an increase in the number of establishments exporting to the United Kingdom (+8.4%) and the European Union (+2.2%) from November 2019 to November 2020. Chart 3 Percentage change (year over year) in number of establishments exporting to selected regions, by industry, November 2019 to November 2020 Note to readers The monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics program will be discontinued following the release of reference month December 2020. Seasonal adjustment With this release, the monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics program incorporates data that have been seasonally adjusted to track the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian exporters on a month-to-month basis. Seasonal adjustment techniques that remove the effect of seasonal and calendar influences from the original data can sharpen the extent to which a time series can be used to evaluate meaningful changes in economic conditions over time. Seasonally adjusted data are available at aggregated levels such as the number of exporters by province, by major country of destination, by enterprise employment size, etc. For more detailed information such as the number of exporters at the industry level by province, data are available on an unadjusted basis only. The analysis in this text, unless stated otherwise, is conducted using seasonally adjusted data. For more information on seasonal adjustment, consult Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The term major trading partners refers to Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States, Brazil, Japan, China and India. These countries represent a subset of the countries defined as Canada's principal trading partners as per the Canadian International Merchandise Trade program and the Balance of International Payments program and are among those that have been the most impacted by COVID-19 in terms of confirmed cases. Methodology The monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics release is a special product that is being published specifically to provide Canadians with timely information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian exporters. Seasonally adjusted data are available from January 2019 to November 2020 at aggregated levels only. For more detailed levels, data are available from January 2019 to November 2020 on a customs basis and unadjusted for seasonal variation. Monthly export data for reference year 2019 are derived from the annual production database, while data for January to November 2020 are newly developed based on a similar linkage methodology used for the annual Trade by Exporter Characteristics – Goods (TEC–Goods) program. Prior to January 2020, data on exports to non-US destinations were collected by Statistics Canada. In January 2020, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) began collecting non-US export data and transmitting them to Statistics Canada on a daily basis. Exporters were gradually transitioned to the CBSA collection system, and collection by Statistics Canada was phased out completely later in 2020. Data collection remains unchanged for exports to the United States; the US Census Bureau collects and transmits the data to Statistics Canada each month under the terms of the Canada–US data exchange. Overall, a very similar linkage methodology is applied to this 23-month monthly time series as to the annual data, ensuring that consistency between monthly and annual data is maintained. For each month from January 2019 to November 2020, the total number of identified exporters accounted for 99% of the total domestic export value. The number of exporters corresponds to the number of exporters identified in the Business Register (2020). The total value of exports refers to all transactions that can be linked from the monthly domestic exports (customs basis) database. In this release, data disseminated at the provincial level are conceptually different from customs-based merchandise export data. Provincial data for the TEC–Goods program are based on the province where the exporters are located. Goods can be shipped to other provinces for final consumption or can be shipped from other provinces when leaving Canada. Customs-based merchandise exports are based on the province of origin, which is the province in which the goods are grown, produced, extracted or manufactured. Monthly domestic export (customs basis) data can be obtained from Canadian International Merchandise Trade (Customs Basis). Data availability Unadjusted and seasonally adjusted data on monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics are available upon request.

Total investment in building construction increased 1.5% in December, following three consecutive months of declines. Investment in the residential sector reached a record high of $11.1 billion. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction increased 1.0% to $12.2 billion in December. For more information on housing, please visit the Housing Statistics Portal. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Non-residential investment remains flat In December, non-residential construction investment remained at $4.4 billion for the third consecutive month. Ontario reported the largest gain—up 2.0% from November—but this growth was offset by declines reported in five provinces. Investment in commercial building construction edged up 0.3% in December, driven in large part by Ontario's growth in this sector (+3.6% to $1.1 billion). The construction of large projects, such as Amazon's Project Python being built in Ottawa, contributed to the rise. Institutional investment (+0.9%) also increased in December. British Columbia led the growth with the construction of a new RCMP building in Fort St. John. Conversely, industrial investment edged down 0.2%, with no significant changes reported in any province. Infographic 1 Investment in non-residential building construction, December 2020 Investment in residential construction reaches record levels Investment in residential construction reached a record high in December, up 1.9% to $11.1 billion. Single-unit investment continued to show strength for the third straight month, up 2.6%. Eight provinces posted gains, with Ontario (+2.8%), Quebec (+3.1%) and Alberta (+4.6%) accounting for the majority of the growth. Newfoundland and Labrador posted a decline in this component for the second straight month resulting from high-value renovation projects coming to a close. Nationally, multi-unit investment increased 1.2%. Notable growth was reported in Ontario and British Columbia, attributable primarily to condominium and apartment building construction. Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in residential building construction, December 2020 Quarterly growth driven by residential sector The total value of investment in building construction edged up 0.3% to $46.2 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by gains in the residential sector (+5.0%). Investment in residential buildings reported a record quarter, with both single-unit (+7.9%) and multi-unit (+2.2%) investment posting gains. Commercial (-13.4%), industrial (-6.4%) and institutional (-3.2%) investments all declined in the fourth quarter, contributing to an overall drop of 9.8% in non-residential investment. The declines in the second and fourth quarters of 2020 reflected the impact of COVID-19 in the non-residential sector. Prior to 2020, the last decrease was posted in the third quarter of 2016. Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions around the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Deflated data and seasonally adjusted data are revised for the previous two months. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates for constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarters' price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to structure type Single. Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage. Effective November 23, 2018, Table 34-10-0175-01 contains data on both the residential and non-residential sectors. It replaced tables 34-10-0010-01, 34-10-0011-01 and 34-10-0012-01. Next release Data on investment in building construction for January 2021 will be released on March 8, 2021.

These graduates may face very challenging conditions as they enter the labour market, which could have long-term ramifications for their earnings prospects. Consequently, earnings losses are simulated up to five years after graduation, based on various scenarios of this year’s youth unemployment rate. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a shutdown of most non-essential businesses and government services in most countries around the globe. This has resulted in a considerable slowdown in economic activity. In Canada, Real Gross Domestic Product was 18.2% lower in April compared to February.Note Moreover, the overall unemployment rate jumped following the onset of the lockdown, going from 5.6% in February 2020 to 13.0% in April 2020.Note Many experts are now forecasting that Canada will enter a recession as a result of COVID‑19.Note Typically, new entrants to the labour market are hit hardest during a recession. In fact, the unemployment rate for youth (15 to 24 year-olds) almost tripled between February (10.3%) and May (29.4%), followed by a modest decline in June (reaching 27.5%).Note The May figure is the highest monthly rate observed since the data have been tabulated, and even notably higher than during the last three recessions in the early 1980s, early 1990s, and late 2000s (Chart 1). Consequently, this year’s class of secondary and postsecondary graduates who will enter the labour market in the coming months may do so under very challenging conditions, raising concerns about their labour market prospects in the years ahead. While the government has announced measures to ease student debt burdenNote , a poor start in one’s career may have implications for many years to follow, as indicated by previous research. Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz (2012) used administrative data on graduates up to 1995 combined with personal tax data and company-level administrative data up to 1999 to demonstrate the importance of labour market conditions during the year of graduation in determining the long-term labour market outcomes of male bachelor’s degree graduates. For example, they found that a 1 percentage point increase in the provincial youth unemployment rate during the year of graduation was associated with a 0.7% decline in constant dollar earnings 5 years following graduation.

The maximum monthly youth unemployment rate registered so far in 2020 is 29.4%. Source: Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey. How will the slowdown from COVID-19 affect this year’s graduating class? Although it is too early to tell, it is possible to expand upon the work of Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz (2012) to gain some insights. To that end, using quinquennial Census data from 1986 to 2016, this article estimates the impact of graduating during a recession on labour market earnings separately for male and female high school, college and bachelor’s degree graduates. The focus is on the relationship between the provincial youth unemployment rate (obtained from the Labour Force Survey) during the graduation year and annual earnings from paid and self-employment up to five years after graduation. To further inform possible labour market impacts on this year’s graduating class, the study then applies the estimated relationship between the youth unemployment rate and graduate outcomes from the past to simulate cumulative earnings losses due to the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19 for this year’s cohort of graduates over the following 5 years. Since it is too early to know what impact COVID‑19 will have on the youth labour market in the coming months, the analysis will be based on various scenarios for this year’s youth unemployment rate. In doing so, this study casts a wide net by simulating earnings losses related to the downturn based on a wide variety of potential youth unemployment rates: 16.0%, 19.0%, 22.0%, 25.0%, and 28.0%.Note It is important to note that the study does not simulate total earnings losses between this year’s class of graduates and previous cohorts, but rather, only the portion of earnings losses that may be caused by the COVID-related economic downturn. Other factors may come into play, which may counterbalance or exacerbate earnings losses related to an economic downturn. For example, increasing automation in the workplace may preferentially benefit knowledge workers whose skills may complement those of robots and computer algorithms, while reducing the demand for workers whose tasks may be automatable.Note Graduates could lose $25,000 or more over the next 5 years if the labour market does not improve soon If the youth unemployment remains close to its June rate of 27.5% for the remainder of the year, this year’s graduates could lose $25,000 or more during the next 5 years compared to what previous graduates earned. For example, male bachelor’s degree graduates could lose $27,887 during this time span if the youth unemployment rate in 2020 will be 28.0% (Chart 2 in the Appendix). This represents a loss of almost $6,000 per year. Potential losses under this scenario range from about $23,000 to $44,000, depending on the sex and education level (see Chart 2, 3, and 4 in the Appendix). Such losses are quite relevant given that many postsecondary graduates typically graduate with significant debt. According to the National Graduates Survey, 49% of college graduates from the class of 2015 held student debt at graduation. Among those who held debt, the average debt was $15,000. Among bachelor’s degree graduates, 54% held student debt at graduation, and the average debt load among those owing money was $28,000.Note However, the size of the student debt load, as well as the magnitude of the simulated earnings losses under the scenario described above are quite small compared to the estimated benefit of graduating with a postsecondary qualification. In fact, Frenette (2019) found that over a 15 year period early in one’s career, male and female bachelor’s degree graduates earned about $500,000 more than their counterparts with a high school diploma. Moreover, an annual youth unemployment rate of 28.0% would top the previous high of 19.2% set in 1983 by 8.8 percentage points. While it is clear that youth are very disproportionately affected during this pandemic due to restaurant, bar, and retail closures or reductions in operations, a turnaround in the youth labour market could happen quickly if the infection curve has been flattened significantly and physical distancing guidelines are eased as a result. If instead this year’s youth unemployment rate roughly matches the historical high at 19.0%, earnings losses are likely to be far more moderate. For example, under this scenario, male bachelor’s degree graduates could lose $9,590 over the next five years, or less than $2,000 per year (Chart 2). In general, potential losses under this scenario, could range from about $8,000 to $15,000 (Chart 2, 3, and 4). Under a scenario where the youth labour market recovers very quickly (i.e. the youth unemployment rate will be 16.0% this year), five year losses could be less than $6,000 for all groups, or less than $1,200 per year (Chart 2, 3, and 4). Female postsecondary graduates face larger potential earnings losses than their male counterparts Regardless of the scenario that actually unfolds, this year’s female postsecondary graduates may incur larger earnings losses during the next five years than their male counterparts. For example, if the unemployment rate remains at around 28.0%, female bachelor’s graduates may lose $43,674, compared to $27,887 among their male counterparts.Note As the annual earnings of women are generally lower than those of men, even when both have a bachelor’s degree, these earnings losses represent a larger share of women’s earnings. Specifically, women could lose 21.3% under this scenario, compared to only 11.6% for men. Even under a more optimistic scenario corresponding to a 16.0% youth unemployment rate, women with a bachelor’s degree could lose $5,467 over the next five years—about $2,000 more than their male counterparts.Note The differences in potential losses are much smaller among college graduates, but they are still larger among women. Under the 28.0% youth unemployment rate scenario, female college graduates may lose $29,491 over the next five years, compared to $25,197 for men. Again, since female college graduates typically earn less than men with a college credential, this difference in dollars corresponds to a much larger difference when expressed as a share of earnings (22.1% for women compared to 14.9% for men). Under the more optimistic scenario (16.0% youth unemployment rate), the earnings loss may be quite negligible over the five year period (about $500 more for women). Among high school graduates, men and women may lose the same amount in dollars, although this represents a larger share of women’s earnings. High school graduates may lose a larger share of their typical earnings than postsecondary graduates When it comes to weathering the storm of the recession, education appears to matter as well. High school graduates may be more adversely affected than postsecondary graduates. Although high school graduates may lose less in dollar earnings than postsecondary graduates, these potential losses represent a larger share of their earnings. This is because postsecondary graduates, earn considerably more than high school graduates on average. For instance, male postsecondary graduates could lose between about $500 and $4,000 more than their high school peers, depending on the scenario that unfolds in the youth labour market. For female postsecondary graduates, the losses may be between about $3,000 and $21,000 more than their high school peers. While the losses are greater in dollar terms for postsecondary graduates, they are larger when viewed as a share of earnings for high school graduates. Under the worst case scenario examined in this study, male high school graduates may lose 8.3 percentage points more of their earnings than bachelor’s degree graduates. For women, the loss would be 3.6 percentage points higher among high school graduates compared to postsecondary graduates. Conclusion Previous research has shown that new graduates are adversely affected by a recessionary economic environment during the year they enter the labour market. Often, the implications of a poor start to one’s career can follow these new graduates for years. The concern is that this year’s graduates will enter the labour market under unusually difficult and unpredictable conditions. This study examines the potential impact of worsening economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown on the earnings of the 2020 secondary and postsecondary graduates. Specifically, this study simulates the initial 5 years of annual earnings of these new high school, college, and bachelor’s degree graduates while taking into consideration various youth unemployment rate scenarios. The main findings suggest that if the youth unemployment rate remains near its current historic high for the remainder of the year, graduates could lose $25,000 or more over the next 5 years. Female postsecondary graduates may be hit somewhat harder than their male counterparts, as could high school graduates compared to postsecondary graduates. The COVID-19 recession may be less predictable than traditional economic downturns, and thus the outcomes may be governed by several atypical factors. For instance, successive waves of the COVID‑19 virus may dictate how the economy recovers since there is a possibility of subsequent shutdowns. Additionally, it is still not known when or if there will be a successful vaccine or treatment, and how effective workplaces will be at adapting to the pandemic environment. Methods The estimated relationship between the youth unemployment rate and annual earnings of graduates derives from a regression of the log of annual earnings on a vector of fixed effects (FEs) for potential experience interacted with the unemployment rate of younger workers (aged 15 to 24) in the province of birth/study and year of graduation. The regression also controls for FEs by potential experience, province of study, survey year and highest level of schooling. Earnings are expressed in 2016 constant dollars, and are bottom- and top-coded at the 1st and 99th percentiles to control for outliers. The sample is restricted to individuals aged 15 to 40 who are not in school (if known, from 1991 onward), who are in the labour force, have 1 to 15 years of potential experience and have strictly positive earnings in the survey year. The “Mincerian” year of graduation is used, defined as year of birth + 6 + total years of schooling. From 2006 onward, years of schooling is not reported so this value is imputed based on the average number of years of schooling required for individuals to complete their highest level of schooling, estimated using data from 2001 and earlier. Potential experience is calculated as the difference between the survey and graduation years.Note Province of study is reported from 2006 onward among those who attended some postsecondary education; for all other respondents, the province of birth (2001 and earlier) or province of residence 5 years ago (2006 onward) is used depending on the availability of these variables. The highest level of schooling is grouped into three categories to maintain consistent reporting across Census years: terminal high school diploma, college diploma graduates, and bachelor’s degree graduates (including professional certifications). Graduates of the trades and registered apprenticeships are not included since their educational pathways are generally less linear than other graduates, which creates challenges in estimating the graduation year on the Census. Moreover, registered apprenticeships did not appear as a category until the 2006 Census. To estimate the model, the data are grouped into cells based on the interaction of province of study, year of graduation, survey year, gender and highest level of schooling. Probability weights are used to compute averages within cells and then each cell is weighted by its sample size using frequency weights in the regressions so the results are nationally-representative. While the regressions include individuals up to 15 years following graduation, earnings losses due to an economic downturn are only simulated up to 5 years post-graduation since longer projections are generally less reliable. Then, to simulate earnings losses, the historical average earnings of graduates are adjusted based on various youth unemployment rate scenarios for 2020 (compared to a historical average) and the marginal impact of youth unemployment at graduation on post-graduate outcomes. The five scenarios for the youth unemployment rate: 16.0%, 19.0%, 22.0%, 25.0%, and 28.0%. Cumulative earnings losses due to the downturn are reported in 2016 constant dollars and in percent terms. The historical comparison group graduated between one and five years prior to one of the Census income reference years (i.e. the calendar year prior to the Census), thus between 1980 and 2014. During this period, the average youth unemployment rate was 14.3%. Note that the simulated earnings loss only refers to the potential loss that is related to a downturn in the youth labour market compared to historical norms. No attempt is made to simulate total earnings losses for this year’s class of graduates as this would require taking into account many other factors, some of which may increase or decrease the demand for graduates. Also note that the historical relationship between the youth unemployment rate during the year of graduation and future earnings may or may not hold in a post-COVID world. Indeed, COVID may affect certain sectors, and thus graduates, more or less than during past recessions. Ultimately, only time will tell what impact COVID will have on graduates.

Howe Institute’s Business Cycle Council, Canada has already entered a recession in the first quarter of 2020 based on the institute’s definition, “a pronounced, persistent, and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity” (C.D. Howe Institute 2020). Moreover, the Bank of Canada’s April 2020 Monetary Policy Report reveals estimates showing, that due to COVID-19, the near-term economic decline is expected to be one of the largest on record (Bank of Canada 2020). Return to note referrer Note See Table 14-10-0287-01. Return to note referrer Note Thus far, the Federal government has proposed several policies to help students overcome financial hardship as a consequence of COVID-19 (Government of Canada 2020). For instance, the government has temporarily suspended principal repayments and interest on student loans and apprentice loans until September 30, 2020. Also, the government plans to expand grants and loans for students who are coming back to school and to create more federal training placement and job opportunities for students. And, for those students and graduates who are unable to work or acquire employment between May and August 2020, the government has instituted the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) program, which will provide monthly monetary compensation. Return to note referrer Note These scenarios are compared to the historical average of 14.3% (see the Methods section for more details). Several factors informed the choice of these potential scenarios, including the historical range of youth unemployment data, post-COVID data on youth unemployment, as well as forecasts of the overall unemployment rate by various banks and other organizations. Return to note referrer Note See the Methods section for more details on the approach used in this study. Return to note referrer Note The student debt figures can be found in Table 37-10-0036-01. Return to note referrer Note It is not clear why, among bachelor’s degree graduates, women are more negatively affected than men. Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz (2012) only study male bachelor’s degree graduates. Although Schwandt and von Wachter (2019) estimate results by sex and also by education level, they do not estimate results separately by sex and education level. One possibility may be related to women’s field of study choices in university. Specifically, women are more likely to select university programs typically associated with lower pay such as arts, education, humanities, and social sciences than men (who are more likely to select higher-paying disciplines such as engineering and mathematics). Whether the fields that women tend to select display more cyclical variability than the choices of men is not known, but it could be the subject of future research. Return to note referrer Note A 16.0% youth unemployment rate would be on par with recessionary periods. For instance, around the time of the 2008‑2009 recession, the peak youth unemployment rate was 16.4%. Return to note referrer Note Although the Mincerian approach will result in measurement errors, the approach is applied to the same sub-samples of the Census in both the actual and simulated earnings. To the extent that biases arising from the measurement error in both the actual and simulated data are similar, focusing on the difference between the two will tend to minimize the impact of the measurement errors.

December data are now available from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), which provides monthly information on payroll employment, earnings and hours worked in Canada, the provinces and the territories. The SEPH provides an account of payroll employment, that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. Preliminary monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are also now available for December. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), data from the SEPH and JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions. Payroll employment increases in December The number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer—measured in the SEPH as payroll employment—rose by 44,200 (+0.3%) in December, after decreasing by 64,500 (-0.4%) in November. The largest increases were in health care and social assistance, and transportation and warehousing. December gains were tempered by declines in accommodation and food services; retail trade; and arts, entertainment and recreation. The total number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer was 1.1 million (-6.2%) lower than in February 2020. The December LFS—for the week of December 6 to 12—recorded a decrease of 53,000 (-0.3%) in the number of people with a job or business, with the largest declines in accommodation and food services; ""other services""; and information, culture and recreation. Employment declines were in self-employment and part-time work. In December, public health measures introduced earlier in the fall remained in place for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as for the Halifax Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island entered a two-week lockdown on December 7. In Quebec, in addition to the measures already implemented, non-essential retail businesses were closed effective December 25. In Ontario, restrictions already in place for some regions of southern Ontario—including the closure of non-essential retail businesses—were extended to the rest of the province effective December 26. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in December after a dip in the previous month Payroll employment changes in December vary by province Payroll employment increased in five provinces in December and decreased in four. Increases were in Ontario (+0.6%; +37,800), Quebec (+0.4%; +13,500), New Brunswick (+0.7%; +2,100), Newfoundland and Labrador (+0.6%; +1,100), and Prince Edward Island (+1.1%; +700). In contrast, payroll employment declined in Manitoba (-0.9%; -5,400), Alberta (-0.3%; -5,200), Saskatchewan (-0.5%; -2,400) and Nova Scotia (-0.3%; -1,400). In December, the three Maritime provinces were closest to pre-COVID-19 employment levels, led by New Brunswick, at 0.5% below the level in February, followed by Prince Edward Island (-2.5%) and Nova Scotia (-3.9%). Little change in average weekly earnings in December Average weekly earnings were $1,112 in December, little changed compared with November. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 6.4%, as job losses since February have been concentrated among hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees. In December, the number of hourly paid employees was 8.9% below its pre-COVID-19 level, compared with a gap of 2.8% for salaried employees. Total hours worked and average hours worked per week hold steady Total hours worked were little changed in December and 5.3% below their pre-COVID-19 February level, compared with a gap of 16.6% in May. Average hours worked per week were also little changed, at 33.6 hours. Rise in payroll employment driven by services-producing sector In December, payroll employment rose in the services-producing sector (+0.2%; +31,900), nearly offsetting the loss in the previous month. December gains were spread across a number of sectors but largest in health care and social assistance (+22,400), and transportation and warehousing (+10,500). At the same time, there were notable losses in accommodation and food services (-32,900); retail trade (-5,600); and arts, entertainment and recreation (-3,600). Employment in the goods-producing sector was little changed for a second consecutive month. Prior to this, employment in the goods-producing sector had been trending up since May. In December, payroll employment in the services-producing sector and the goods-producing sector was 6.5% and 4.6% below pre-COVID-19 levels, respectively. Health care and social assistance sector surpasses pre-COVID-19 level of employment The upward trend in payroll employment in health care and social assistance continued in December, with the number of payroll jobs rising by 22,400 (+1.1%) month over month. This brought employment in the sector to 0.8% above its pre-COVID-19 level. The December rise in payroll employment in this sector was spread across ambulatory health care services (+8,600), nursing and residential care facilities (+5,800), social assistance (+4,300), and hospitals (+3,700). Most of the growth in health care and social assistance in the fourth quarter of 2020 was in the ambulatory health care services and social assistance subsectors. Average weekly earnings in health care and social assistance were $1,029 in December, up 7.1% compared with 12 months earlier. Recovery resumes in transportation and warehousing Payroll employment increased in transportation and warehousing (+10,500; +1.4%) in December, after a decrease of 4,800 (-0.6%) in November. The increase in this sector coincided with a holiday season marked by online shopping as in-person shopping and in-person gatherings were limited in many provinces as a result of public health restrictions. Within the sector, the largest payroll employment increases were concentrated in subsectors related to online shopping and mail and parcel delivery—led by postal service (+2,400; +3.2%), warehousing and storage (+1,700; +2.7%), and truck transportation (+1,700; +0.8%). On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in the transportation and warehousing sector grew 5.7% to $1,178. Payroll employment up in professional, scientific and technical services for seventh consecutive month Payroll employment rose for the seventh consecutive month in professional, scientific and technical services, up 6,700 (+0.7%) in December. A relatively small share of jobs in this sector—which includes computer systems design services and advertising and related services—require close physical proximity to others, limiting the impact of public health measures on the sector. The December gain was spread across nearly all industries, with the largest increases in computer systems design and related services (+3,200) and architectural, engineering and related services (+1,700). Most of the employment growth in the sector was in Ontario. In December, payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services was 0.5% below the February level. Scientific research and development services were the furthest above their pre-pandemic level (+5.9%), followed by computer systems design and related services (+3.9%), while advertising, public relations, and related services were the furthest below their February level (-9.1%). Year over year, average weekly earnings in professional, scientific and technical services were up 3.6% to $1,496. This sector is among the highest paying in Canada. Accommodation and food services, and arts, entertainment and recreation continue to decline Payroll employment in accommodation and food services fell for the second consecutive month, down 3.4% (-32,900) in December, with declines in all provinces except Prince Edward Island. The largest losses were in full-service restaurants and limited-service eating places, traveller accommodation, and drinking places. This brought payroll employment in accommodation and food services to 30.4% below the February level. Sales in the food services and drinking places subsector fell for a third consecutive month, down 8.0% to $4.2 billion in December. On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in accommodation and food services rose 3.6% to $443. Payroll employment in arts, entertainment and recreation also declined for a second month in a row, down 1.7% (-3,600) in December, the result of losses in other amusement and recreation industries, which include skiing facilities, as well as recreational, sports and fitness centres. Compared with February, employment in the sector was down 32.0%. On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in arts, entertainment and recreation were up 17.2% to $711 in December. Payroll employment in tourism-related industries declines for a second month in a row After trending upward from May to September, payroll employment in tourism-related industries—a total of 27 industries mostly in transportation; arts, entertainment and recreation; and accommodation and food services—fell 6.3% (-98,700) from October to December. Many provinces have implemented targeted public health measures since September in response to a rise in COVID-19 cases. With this decline, employment in tourism-related industries was 27.3% (-549,100) below its February level, accounting for over half (51.8%) of the overall payroll employment decline. First payroll employment decline in retail trade since May Payroll employment in retail trade declined by 0.3% (-5,600) in December, following six consecutive months of increases. Notable declines were recorded in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-6,200), and health and personal care stores (-2,700). At the same time, employment increased in food and beverage stores (+3,200). Most of the decline in the sector was observed in Ontario. Since the closure of non-essential retail businesses occurred towards the end of December in Quebec and Ontario, many employees affected by this measure likely received pay after the shutdown and would have been counted in December payroll employment. In December, retail sales posted their largest decline (-3.4%) since the low of April driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Employment in retail trade was 4.5% below its February level in December, with the number of payroll jobs in clothing and clothing accessories stores continuing to be the furthest from its pre-pandemic level (-18.9%). Average weekly earnings in retail trade were $632, up 1.1% compared with December 2019. Monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey In December, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 478,000 positions (not seasonally adjusted) as they continued to navigate COVID-19 and the associated public health measures. The job vacancy rate, which represents vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied) was 3.0% in December, following a rate of 3.3% in November and 3.5% in October (not seasonally adjusted). While monthly and quarterly job vacancy statistics are not directly comparable because of seasonal patterns and month-to-month variations within quarters, prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the quarterly job vacancy rate ranged from 3.0% to 3.5% between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. The job vacancy rate is a key measure of unmet labour demand and, in conjunction with other indicators such as payroll employment and the unemployment rate, provides valuable insight into the labour market. For example, a high job vacancy rate could represent either an increased pace of recruiting or difficulty on the part of employers in finding or retaining suitable candidates. Health care and social assistance sector continues to have the most vacancies In December, the health care and social assistance sector continued to have the highest number of job vacancies (95,000), and it had a job vacancy rate of 4.4% (not seasonally adjusted), the second-highest job vacancy rate of any sector. From October to December, the monthly job vacancy rate for this sector was higher than the quarterly rates observed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate ranged from 3.0% to 3.3% between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Retail trade had the second-highest number of vacancies (51,800) in December and a job vacancy rate of 2.6% (not seasonally adjusted). The number of job vacancies in this sector can vary largely based on seasonal patterns. Job vacancies in retail trade were lower in December than in November (69,700) and October (92,800), when retail businesses were recruiting more in preparation for the holiday season. Provincially, the highest job vacancy rates were in British Columbia (3.6%) and Quebec (3.5%) (not seasonally adjusted). These two provinces have consistently had the highest job vacancy rates since monthly job vacancy statistics became available in October 2020, and they had among the highest job vacancy rates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Job vacancy rates were lowest in Alberta (1.9%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (2.0%). A more detailed analysis on job vacancies (by occupation and economic region, for example) will be released with the quarterly estimates (October to December 2020) of the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey on March 23, 2021. Looking ahead January SEPH results—to be released on March 30—will provide detailed information on the subsectors that continue to be most affected by the reimplementation and tightening of public health measures to control the spread of COVID-19. In particular—and building on the January LFS results—these results will shed further light on the impacts of the province-wide closure of non-essential retail businesses in Quebec and Ontario at the end of December. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers With the March 30 release of January 2021 estimates, seasonally adjusted data will be revised based on the latest seasonal factors. Seasonally adjusted estimates will be revised historically back to 2001. In addition to the new seasonal factors, historical revisions will be made for a small number of industries (four-digit level of the North American Industry Classification System [NAICS]). The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees, and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, data on average weekly hours are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupations for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wage and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. In addition, year-over-year comparisons between estimates of different frequencies (month vs. quarter) should be interpreted with caution as job vacancy statistics can vary from month to month within a quarter. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on March 15, 2021. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours and job vacancies for January 2021 will be released on March 30, 2021.

In the fourth quarter, Canadian corporations reported a 7.9% increase in net income before taxes to $82.5 billion, a growth of $6.1 billion. Operating revenues rose 1.8% to $1,080.4 billion during the quarter. Net income before taxes in the non-financial sector increases Net income before taxes in the non-financial sector increased by 12.8% (or $6.0 billion) to $53.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Chart 1 Corporate net income before taxes (seasonally adjusted) Net income before taxes in oil and gas extraction and support activities increased by $3.7 billion (+56.5%) in the fourth quarter. This increase is attributable to higher oil prices and volumes for the quarter. Nonetheless, the industry reported losses for a fourth consecutive quarter, recording a loss of $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter. This was an improvement from the loss of $6.6 billion in the third quarter. Manufacturing net income before taxes edges down Net income before taxes in the manufacturing industry edged down by $120 million (-0.9%), reaching $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Petroleum and coal manufacturing led the decrease in net income before taxes, down $870 (-187.1%) million as expenses related to asset revaluations increased in the fourth quarter. Net income before taxes in motor vehicle and trailer manufacturing decreased by $536 million (-45.8%) as revenues were down this quarter. Exports of motor vehicles and parts decreased by 9.9% in the fourth quarter. Mostly offsetting these decreases in net income before taxes for the manufacturing industry was wood and paper manufacturing, which rose by $711 million (+32.4%), on increased prices and robust demand in the panels segment of the industry. Retail trade sector net income before taxes decreases Net income before taxes in the retail trade sector decreased (-17.8%, or -$776 million) to $3.6 billion. The food and beverage stores industry led the decrease in net income before taxes, down $2.6 billion (-187.8%) on lower revenues. Motor vehicles and parts dealers recorded an increase in net income before taxes (+$755 million, or +126.9%). Financial sector net income before taxes edges up Net income before taxes for financial corporations edged up 0.1% (+$37 million) to $29.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Life, health and medical insurance carriers led the increase, up $873 million (+56.2%) because of higher premium revenues. The banking and depository credit intermediation industry saw continued growth from the prior quarter, with net income before taxes reaching $9.5 billion in the fourth quarter—a rise of 6.2% (+$553 million). Mostly offsetting those increases in net income before taxes for the financial sector were the property and casualty insurance carriers that decreased by $1.4 billion (-50.7%) in the fourth quarter. Chart 2 Change in income or loss before income taxes in major non-financial industries Note to readers Data from the Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements (QSFS) include amounts from government programs that support business, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. These amounts are considered to be revenue for these businesses. However, with response rates lower than historical averages; the potential delay in the release of this information by businesses; and the methodology used to calculate QSFS estimates, use of these government support programs may be underestimated in the published data. Data on quarterly net income before taxes in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Quarterly financial statistics for enterprises are based on a sample survey and represent the activities of all corporations in Canada, except those that are government-controlled or not-for-profit. The survey collects data on balance sheets, income statements and additional disclosures of enterprises. An enterprise can be a single corporation or a family of corporations under common ownership or control, for which consolidated financial statements are produced. Survey changes The following changes were introduced to the survey starting with the first quarter of 2020: New content was implemented in the first quarter to align the survey to new accounting standards adopted by corporations starting in 2011. New industrial breakdowns were implemented, allowing for more granularity in the dissemination of data, were implemented. As a result, some industry groupings were merged, others were split and some remained the same. The survey's sample was modified to support the new industrial breakdowns; however, a maximum sample overlap with the previous sample was adopted. A more automated imputation strategy was implemented to streamline the process and to reduce the need for manual intervention. Analytical focus change Up to the fourth quarter of 2019, the QSFS focused primarily on operating profit/losses to track the financial performance of enterprises. An enterprise earns operating profits from its core business operations and is the difference between operating revenues and operating expenses. The content for the QSFS questionnaire, up until the fourth quarter of 2019, did not include a distinction between operating revenues and expenses. To calculate the operating profit of an enterprise, additional information on expenses—particularly cost of goods sold—was collected and included in the calculation. Over time, the response rate for the cost of goods sold variable declined. Accounts used by financial industries and non-financial industries differed due to the nature of their activity, with some enterprises no longer reporting operating profits in their financial statements. Changes to accounting standards in 2006 (new financial instruments standards) and in 2011 (adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards) included the introduction of gains/losses in asset revaluations, which further complicated the calculation of operating profits. Asking respondents to report categories of revenue and expenses, as well as a breakdown, within each of those two categories, between operating and non-operating amounts, would have increased response burden. Being an economy-wide program, the QSFS requires a certain degree of comparability with the concepts used to assess financial performance across enterprises and industries. To overcome some of the difficulties in terms of comparability at the operating profit level, and to avoid increased response burden, the focus of QSFS analysis will change—starting with the first quarter of 2020— from operating profit to net income before income taxes to better assess an enterprise's financial performance. Net income before income taxes is earned from normal business activities. Net income before income taxes is a more inclusive measure and its calculations are more standardized between enterprises and industries. Revisions, benchmarking and back-casting The release of the QSFS in the fourth quarter 2020 includes revised estimates from the first, second and third quarter 2020. Efforts are being made to back-cast these data to the first quarter of 2010 to allow for better historical comparisons. However, as more than one cycle of the new content is required before this exercise can begin, users are encouraged to be cautious when making historical comparisons. It is expected that the back-casting work will be completed and results will be released at the end of 2021. Larger-than-usual revisions may be anticipated in the future, as quarterly revisions, annual benchmarking, back casting and receipt of new survey data from respondents will be incorporated to improve data quality and include the most up-to-date data. Business performance and ownership statistics portal The Business performance and ownership statistics portal, accessible from the Subjects module of our website, provides users a single point of access to a wide variety of information related to business performance and ownership in Canada. Next release Financial statistics for enterprises for the first quarter of 2021 will be released on May 25, 2021.

This occurred against the backdrop of tightening restrictions on business activity in several provinces to contain the spread of COVID-19. By the end of the year, the number of exporting enterprises was up 19.9% from the low in April, but it was still 3.5% below pre-pandemic levels observed in February. December's rise in goods exporters was led by enterprises with fewer than 50 employees (+2.4%). These exporters, which are generally less integrated in global supply chains, had been among the most impacted during the initial months of the pandemic. Chart 1 Number of exporting enterprises, by employment size, January to December 2020 Number of exporters to the United States almost reaches pre-pandemic levels The number of enterprises that exported goods to the United States rose 3.9% in December to reach 16,627. After an almost 20% decline from February to April, the number of exporters to the United States in December had almost fully recovered to February levels (16,632). However, in terms of value, exports were still 7.2% below their February levels on a balance of payments basis. Among other major trading partners, the number of exporters to Spain (+9.3%), Italy (+3.5%), Japan (+3.5%) and China (+3.5%) also grew month over month in December. The number of exporters to each of these countries was above February levels at year-end. At the global level, a region that has been relatively less affected by the pandemic is Oceania. When the number of Canadian exporters is compared between December 2019 and December 2020 by region of destination, Oceania was the only region showing an increase (+2.8%). This slight growth was primarily attributable to small exporting enterprises (fewer than 50 employees)—their number went up 10.9% over this period, led by exporters of electronic and electrical equipment and parts. Alberta and British Columbia see the largest monthly increase in exporters An enterprise can have multiple establishments located in different provinces or territories and operating in various industries. Most provinces posted month-over-month growth in the number of exporting establishments in December, with the largest increases observed in the western provinces of Alberta (+98) and British Columbia (+80). This growth was led by establishments from the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector and was mainly among those exporting to the United States. The number of exporters in Quebec (+38) and Ontario (+28) also went up, but to a lesser extent. In relative terms, only the Atlantic region (+3.6%) and Manitoba (+3.0%) were above their February levels by the end of the year. The growth in the Atlantic region was tied to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector, while Manitoba's increase was related to wholesale trade. Several of Manitoba's wholesale trade establishments export agricultural products such as wheat, soybeans, and rape or colza seeds. Amid strong global demand and rising prices, the total value of Manitoba's exports of these products has gone up significantly year over year. Chart 2 Percentage change in number of exporting establishments, by selected province or region, February to December 2020 Table 1 Number of exporting enterprises, by region of destination, December 2019 to December 2020 Note to readers The monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics program will be discontinued following the release of reference month December 2020. Seasonal adjustment With this release, the monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics program incorporates data that have been seasonally adjusted to track the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian exporters on a month-to-month basis. Seasonal adjustment techniques that remove the effect of seasonal and calendar influences from the original data can sharpen the extent to which a time series can be used to evaluate meaningful changes in economic conditions over time. Seasonally adjusted data are available at aggregated levels, such as the number of exporters by province, by major country of destination, by enterprise employment size, etc. For more detailed information such as the number of exporters at the industry level by province, data are available on an unadjusted basis only. The analysis in this text, unless stated otherwise, is conducted using seasonally adjusted data. For more information on seasonal adjustment, consult Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The term major trading partners refers to Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United States, Brazil, Japan, China and India. These countries represent a subset of the countries defined as Canada's principal trading partners as per the Canadian International Merchandise Trade program and the Balance of International Payments program and are among those that have been the most impacted by COVID-19 in terms of confirmed cases. Methodology The monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics release is a special product that is being published specifically to provide Canadians with timely information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian exporters. Seasonally adjusted data are available from January 2019 to December 2020 at aggregated levels only. For more detailed levels, data are available from January 2019 to December 2020 on a customs basis and unadjusted for seasonal variation. Monthly export data for reference year 2019 are derived from the annual production database, while data for January to December 2020 are newly developed based on a similar linkage methodology used for the annual Trade by Exporter Characteristics – Goods (TEC–Goods) program. Prior to January 2020, data on exports to non-US destinations were collected by Statistics Canada. In January 2020, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) began collecting non-US export data and transmitting them to Statistics Canada on a daily basis. Exporters were gradually transitioned to the CBSA collection system, and collection by Statistics Canada was phased out completely later in 2020. Data collection remains unchanged for exports to the United States; the US Census Bureau collects and transmits the data to Statistics Canada each month under the terms of the Canada–US data exchange. Overall, a very similar linkage methodology is applied to this 24-month monthly time series as to the annual data, ensuring that consistency between monthly and annual data is maintained. For each month from January 2019 to December 2020, the total number of identified exporters accounted for 99% of the total domestic export value. The number of exporters corresponds to the number of exporters identified in the Business Register (2020). The total value of exports refers to all transactions that can be linked from the monthly domestic exports (customs basis) database. In this release, data disseminated at the provincial level are conceptually different from customs-based merchandise export data. Provincial data for the TEC–Goods program are based on the province where the exporters are located. Goods can be shipped to other provinces for final consumption or can be shipped from other provinces when leaving Canada. Customs-based merchandise exports are based on the province of origin, which is the province in which the goods are grown, produced, extracted or manufactured. Monthly domestic export (customs basis) data can be obtained from Canadian International Merchandise Trade (Customs Basis). Data availability Unadjusted and seasonally adjusted data on monthly trade in goods by exporter characteristics are available upon request.

January rang in the new year with a record high total value of building permits issued, rising 8.2% to $9.9 billion and surpassing the previous record of $9.6 billion set in April 2019. These gains were driven primarily by the residential sector. Chart 1 Total value of building permits Chart 2 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Infographic 1 Building permits, January 2021 Residential sector surges to new heights The value of permits issued in the residential sector increased 10.6% to $7.1 billion in January—rising past the previous peak of $6.5 billion posted two months earlier. Provincial highs were reported in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Manitoba. The majority of the rise in the residential sector was attributable to single-family homes, which climbed 15.1% to a record $3.5 billion—the eighth increase in nine months. Continuing the upward trend observed since October, the value of single-family permits issued in Quebec soared, rising 40.3%. Much of the gain came from regions outside of census metropolitan areas (CMAs). Multi-family permits increased 6.5% to $3.5 billion, mainly driven by higher construction intentions in Ontario (+17.1%), where several permits in excess of $100 million were issued for condominium apartments in the CMA of Toronto. Conversely, the value of multi-family building permits in Quebec fell for a fifth consecutive month in January. Chart 3 Month-to-month change in the value of residential building permits Chart 4 Month-to-month change in the value of non-residential building permits Non-residential sector up modestly in January The total value of permits issued for non-residential buildings rose 2.6% to $2.8 billion in January after a 10.8% drop in December. Following three consecutive monthly declines, industrial permits bounced back to average 2020 levels, increasing 31.7% to $535 million in January. High-value permits for an Amazon warehouse in Lachine, Quebec, and for two Eglinton Crosstown light rail transit stations in Toronto helped reverse the downward trend. The value of commercial permits increased 3.3% to $1.5 billion. Six provinces posted increases in this component, led by Ontario (+14.7%) and Quebec (+20.4%). Within the institutional component, municipalities issued permits worth $781 million, 11.8% lower than December. Values in Newfoundland and Labrador returned to typical levels following a $170 million hospital renovation permit issued in Corner Brook the previous month, pushing the national total lower.

For more information on housing, please visit the Housing Statistics Portal. Statistics Canada has a Housing Market Indicators dashboard. This web application provides access to key housing market indicators for Canada, by province and by CMA. These indicators are updated automatically with new information from monthly releases, giving users access to the latest data. Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The Building Permits Survey covers over 2,400 municipalities, representing 95% of the Canadian population. The communities representing the other 5% of the population are very small, and their levels of building activity have little impact on the total for the entire population. Building permit data are used as a leading indicator of activity in the construction industry. The value of planned construction activities presented in this release excludes engineering projects (such as waterworks, sewers or culverts) and land. For the purposes of this release, the census metropolitan area of Ottawa–Gatineau (Ontario and Quebec) is divided into two areas: the Ottawa part and the Gatineau part. Unless otherwise specified, the highlights refer to seasonally adjusted current dollars and are ranked in terms of dollar change rather than percentage change. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous two months have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous three months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for February will be released on April 1.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) edged up 0.1% in December, following a 0.8% increase in November. This eighth consecutive monthly increase continued to offset the steepest drops on record in Canadian economic activity in March and April. Nevertheless, total economic activity was about 3% below February's pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product grows in December Infographic 1 Peak pandemic declines and December 2020 Goods-producing industries were up 0.6% while services-producing industries edged down 0.1% as 12 of 20 industrial sectors increased in December. Advanced information indicates an approximate 0.5% increase in real GDP for January 2021. The wholesale trade, manufacturing and construction sectors led the increase while retail trade declined. Owing to its preliminary nature, this estimate will be revised on March 31 with the release of the official GDP data for the January 2021 reference month. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector keeps growing The mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector grew 2.9% in December as all three subsectors expanded. With a fourth consecutive monthly gain, the sector continued recouping the declines largely experienced through the second and third quarters of the year, but remained about 7% below February's pre-pandemic level of activity. Chart 2 Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector grows in December Oil and gas extraction rose 2.5% in December, up for the fourth consecutive month. Oil sands extraction grew 4.0%, driven by the highest level of synthetic oil production in Alberta since the series started in 1997, as a number of facilities continued ramping up production following production disruptions and delayed maintenance activities. Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) was up 0.7%, the third gain in four months, as higher crude petroleum extraction more than offset lower natural gas extraction. Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) rose 3.6% in December, following a 7.4% jump in November. Non-metallic mineral mining increased 6.4% on the strength of potash mining (+13.2%), as international demand for the mineral strengthened in the last two months of the year. Metal ore mining expanded 2.1% as all types of activities were up. Growth in iron ore (+4.2%) and a surge in other metal ore mining (+13.2%) as uranium production resumed following pandemic-induced closures, contributed the most to the increase. Support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction grew 3.7%, the sixth consecutive monthly increase, as all types of support activities were up. The public sector continues to grow The public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) grew 0.6% in December, as all three components were up. Health care and social assistance rose 0.8%, led by ambulatory health care services (+1.7%). The educational services sector was up 0.6%, as elementary and secondary schools contributed the most to the increase. Public administration grew 0.5% as all levels of government services recorded growth in December. Retail trade contracts Sales in the retail trade sector fell 3.3% in December, after seven consecutive months of growth, as 10 of 12 subsectors were down. December saw the reintroduction of lockdown measures across many parts the country including the closure of all non-essential retailing and strict capacity and physical distancing control at essential retailers. Activity at stores typically associated with the holiday shopping season declined as clothing and clothing accessories (-13.6%), general merchandise (-6.2%), sporting goods, hobby, book and music (-19.9%) and electronic and appliance (-10.3%) stores fell. Activity at gasoline stations declined 3.4% in December as stay-at-home orders and other measures contributed to lower gasoline product demand during what would typically be a busy driving season. Non-store retailers were also down (-1.1%) as many holiday-shoppers did their shopping early, anticipating restrictions and longer delivery times than usual. Only retailing activity at food and beverage stores (+0.3%) and health and personal care stores (+0.5%) was up as those were designated essential services and allowed to remain open under modified hours. Wholesale trade contracts Wholesale trade contracted 1.2% in December, the largest, and only the second, decline since April, as six of nine subsectors were down. Machinery, equipment and supplies wholesaling (-2.6%) contributed the most to the decline as the majority of industries were down, reflecting lower levels of exports and imports of machinery. Motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories wholesaling was down 3.1%, as lower production and exports of passenger cars, light trucks and motor vehicle parts contributed to the decline. Miscellaneous (+1.0%), farm product wholesaling (+2.2%), and building material and supplies (+0.3%) offset some of the decline. Manufacturing declines The manufacturing sector contracted 1.1% in December, as lower sales and lower inventory contributed to the largest, and only the second decline in the sector since April. Non-durable manufacturing decreased 1.6%, following three months of growth, as the majority of subsectors were down. Plastics and rubber products (-9.4%), petroleum and coal products (-4.4%) and chemical manufacturing (-1.6%) contributed the most to the decline while food (+2.1%) and paper manufacturing (+1.9%) partially offset some of the decreases. Durable manufacturing contracted 0.6% as 4 of 10 subsectors decreased. Lower machinery (-3.6%), fabricated metal products (-2.7%) and primary metal manufacturing (-3.8%) contributed the most to the decline. Wood products (+2.8%), non-metallic mineral products (+3.3%), and computer and electronic products manufacturing (+3.2%) partly offset the declines. Accommodation and food services decline The reintroduction of lockdown measures in December across the country and announcements of additional travel restrictions to come took a bite out of accommodation and food services and contributed to a 6.8% contraction in the sector. Food services and drinking places were down 6.7%, as most types of restaurants and drinking places reported lower activity, while accommodation services shrank 7.1%. Construction grows Construction rose 1.2% in December, following a 0.3% contraction in November, as the majority of subsectors increased. Residential construction grew 1.4% in December as single-unit and alterations and improvements increased. Repair construction increased 1.5%, while engineering and other construction activities grew 1.4%. Non-residential construction was down for the sixth consecutive month, edging down 0.3% in December, with lower industrial and commercial construction offsetting an uptick in institutional construction. Real estate and rental and leasing grows Chart 3 Activity at offices of real estate agents and brokers grows in December Real estate and rental and leasing grew 0.9% in December, up for an eighth month in a row. With an 8.5% jump in December, activity at the offices of real estate agents and brokers more than offset the previous two monthly contractions to reach an all-time high as continued strong home resale activity across the country fueled the growth. Other industries Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting was up 1.1% in December led by higher crop production and forestry and logging. Transportation and warehousing grew 0.7% as all subsectors, except for water transportation (-1.3%), were up in December. The professional, scientific and technical sector was up 0.4%, the eighth consecutive increase, as the majority of industries grew in December. The finance and insurance sector edged down 0.1% in December driven by a 2.0% decline in financial investment services, funds and other financial vehicles. Utilities were essentially unchanged in December as an uptick in electric power generation, transmission and distribution (+0.3%) was offset by lower natural gas distribution (-1.8%). Chart 4 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product Fourth quarter 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented impacts across many industrial sectors. After a strong rebound in the third quarter, marked by the reopening of the economy following the first lockdowns, economic activity continued to expand in the fourth quarter. Value added of goods-producing industries grew 2.4% while services-producing industries rose 2.1%. Overall, there were gains in 18 of 20 industrial sectors. The largest contributor to the increase in the services-producing industries was a 3.1% rise in the public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) as all three components rose. Health care and social assistance services grew (+3.5%), driven by ambulatory health care services (services provided by offices of physicians, health practitioners, dentists, medical and diagnostic laboratories). Educational services rose 3.8% while public administration was up 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Professional, scientific and technical services (+3.6%) added to the growth as all industries within the sector were up in the quarter. Growth was led by computer systems design and related services (+3.2%), other professional, scientific and technical services including research and development (+5.0%) and legal services (+4.8%). Finance and insurance rose 2.0%, on widespread growth across all subsectors. The momentum, seen in the third quarter in the securities markets, continued into fourth quarter. The high level of trading activity of federal government bonds, along with other increased activity such as the money market and the bond repo market, contributed to a 4.5% increase in financial investment services. Activity at depository credit intermediation and monetary authorities rose 1.3% as record-low interest rates on mortgages and loans encouraged lending to customers. Insurance carriers and related activities were up 2.8%. Real estate and rental and leasing (+0.9%) increased for the second quarter in a row. Strong home resale market across the country pushed activity at the offices of real estate agents and brokers up (+3.1%) to record high levels. The transportation and warehousing sector posted gains (+3.2%), with the majority of subsectors up, led by rail (+6.6%), truck (+1.6%) and air (+40.2%) transportation, as business activities continued to rebound for the second consecutive quarter. Wholesale trade rose 1.7%, as eight of nine subsectors grew, led by a 4.2% increase in machinery, equipment and supplies wholesaling. Retail trade was up 0.7%, led by building material, garden equipment and supplies (+6.6%) supported by another strong increase in residential construction. Mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction rose 6.1%, the largest quarterly gain since the second quarter of 2019, as the sector continued offsetting the declines of the second and third quarters of 2020. Oil and gas extraction expanded 5.2%, led by an 11.4% increase in the oil sands extraction as crude bitumen and synthetic oil production ramped up in Alberta. Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) shrank 1.0% as growth in natural gas extraction was more than offset by lower crude petroleum, particularly at Canada's North Atlantic facilities. Support activities for mining and oil and gas extraction jumped by more than one-third (+35.0%), led by higher drilling and rigging services but remain well below levels from the beginning of the year. Mining and quarrying (excluding oil and gas) rose 0.7% led by increases in coal (+14.1%) and iron ore (+9.7%) mining, coinciding with strong global demand for iron ore used in steel production. The gains were largely offset by a 13.9% decrease in potash mining, as international demand for the mineral declined. Manufacturing gained 1.4%, following an 18.0% jump in the third quarter. Non-durable manufacturing rose 2.5% with gains largely concentrated in petroleum and coal product manufacturing (+11.5%) as activities at Canada's refineries grew in the quarter. Durable manufacturing edged up 0.4% with gains in 7 of 10 subsectors. Leading the growth were fabricated metal (+4.1%), wood (+3.6%), and computer and electronic (+3.3%) product manufacturing. A 3.9% decline in transportation equipment manufacturing tempered the growth. Construction grew 1.7%, up for the second consecutive quarter. Leading the growth was residential construction (+4.2%) as changing housing demand and declines in mortgage interest costs contributed to the increase. Repair (+4.7%) and engineering and other construction activities (+2.5%) were up, while non-residential construction declined 8.5% as all types of non-residential construction were down in the fourth quarter. Chart 5 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product, fourth quarter Year 2020 Activity was down in 17 of 20 industrial sectors in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic and measures put in place to reduce the spread of the virus affected economic activities to various degrees. Goods-producing industries' value added declined 6.2%, the largest annual decrease since 2009. Services-producing industries contracted 4.9% over the year, the largest decline since the beginning of the series in 1961, and contributed more to the overall economic decline. The decline in services-producing industries was widespread, affecting more adversely services whose online delivery is unfeasible or not economically viable. The transportation and warehousing sector dropped 19.8%, contributing the most to the decline in services. Air transportation (-73.7%) was severely impacted by the travel restrictions imposed by governments around the world. These measures led a large number of Canadian airlines to either completely shutter their operations or drastically reduce their operating capacity in 2020. In concert with domestic and international travel restriction and also impacted by additional measures across many Canadian jurisdictions on indoor dining, the accommodation and food services sector fell by one-third (-33.4%). The public sector (education, health and public administration combined) decreased 4.3% driven mostly by health care and social assistance (-5.8%). Ambulatory health care services were down 13.3% in 2020 as offices of physicians, dentists and medical and diagnostic laboratories reduced many of their in-person visits and activities in response to the onset of the pandemic. Finance and insurance (+3.8%) and real estate and rental and leasing (+1.7%) were the only two sectors in the services-producing industries to have positive growth in 2020 as government authorities responded decisively to help the economy. With regards to the global pandemic and to secure liquidity on the financial market, the Bank of Canada cut the overnight lending rate three times in 2020 and was engaged in large-scale asset purchase programs. The main contributor to the decrease in goods-producing industries was manufacturing, which fell 9.5% in 2020 after edging down 0.2% in 2019. Durable manufacturing dropped 13.0%, mainly due to the transportation equipment subsector (-19.8%). This subsector was severely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown measures put in place in March and April 2020 as consumers decided to postpone the purchase of big-ticket consumer goods in the midst of uncertainty and lack of accessibility brought about by the pandemic. The contraction in non-durable manufacturing (-5.2%) was primarily the result of declines in petroleum and coal (-12.4%) and plastics and rubber (-10.2%) products. Across the manufacturing sector, the only subsector to increase its activities was miscellaneous manufacturing (+2.3%), which includes medical equipment and supplies manufacturing. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction was down 9.7% in 2020 due to lower activity in the oil and gas extraction (-6.4%) and support activities for mining, and oil gas (-31.1%) extraction subsectors. Oil and gas (except oil sands) (-6.7%) and oil sands (-6.1%) extraction decreased, reflecting reduced global demand for energy products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) declined 7.6%. The annual decline in construction (-3.7%) was mostly attributable to engineering and other construction activities (-8.6%). Non-residential construction fell 2.8% as remote work and online shopping reduced construction activity related to office buildings and shopping malls. Residential construction, in contrast, increased 1.1% in spite of the lockdown measures. Consumers spent more on investment goods such as houses as social distancing measures and travel restrictions helped contribute to higher household savings. The agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector (+4.7%) was the sole goods-producing industries sector to post gains in 2020 as some of the subsectors were deemed essential and remained exempt from lockdown measures.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The release on gross domestic product by industry is an example of how Statistics Canada supports global sustainable development goal reporting. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Monthly data on gross domestic product (GDP) by industry at basic prices are chained volume estimates with 2012 as the reference year. This means that the data for each industry and each aggregate are obtained from a chained volume index multiplied by the industry's value added in 2012. The monthly data are benchmarked to annually chained Fisher volume indexes of GDP obtained from the constant-price supply and use tables (SUTs) up to the latest SUT year (2017). For the period starting in January 2018, data are derived by chaining a fixed-weight Laspeyres volume index to the prior period. The fixed weights are 2017 industry prices. This approach makes the monthly GDP by industry data more comparable with expenditure-based GDP data, which are chained quarterly. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. An advance estimate of industrial production for January 2021 is available upon request. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Revisions With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions have been made back to January 2020. Each month, newly available administrative and survey data from various industries in the economy are integrated, resulting in statistical revisions. Updated and revised administrative data (including taxation statistics), new information provided by respondents to industry surveys, and standard changes to seasonal adjustment calculations are incorporated with each release. Real-time table Real-time table 36-10-0491-01 will be updated on March 15, 2021. Next release Data on GDP by industry for January 2021 will be released on March 31, 2021.

Retail sales posted their largest decline since the low of April driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing 3.4% to $53.4 billion in December. Sales were down in 9 out of 11 subsectors, representing 83.6% of retail sales. Core retail sales—which exclude sales by gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—also posted their slowest growth since April, falling 4.6% in December on lower sales at general merchandise stores and clothing and clothing accessories stores, as well as sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores. In volume terms, retail sales fell 3.6% in December. On a quarterly basis, retail sales were up 1.2% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of 2020, while retail sales in volume terms increased 0.8%. With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Canada, provincial governments began to reintroduce physical distancing measures, which directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, approximately 15% of retailers were closed during December. The average length of the shutdown was two business days. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 3.3% in January. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 51% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 86.8%. Chart 1 Retail sales decrease in December Widespread declines weigh down core retail sales On the heels of continued growth in November, core retail sales declined 4.6% in December as all subsectors in this group, except health and personal care stores (+0.3%), posted lower sales. The largest contributor to the decline in core retail sales was general merchandise stores (-7.6%). Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores fell for the third consecutive month, decreasing 17.0% in December—the largest decline for this subsector since April. Approximately half of the retailers in this subsector reported being closed for an average of six business days in December. In April, 70% of retailers in this subsector were closed for an average of 20 days. Two of the three industries in this subsector reported declines in December, while sales at shoe stores edged up 0.1%. Following two months of growth, sales at sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores decreased by over one-fifth (-22.5%) in December. This decrease coincided with the closure of brick-and-mortar retailers in several regions on Boxing Day, as well as other restrictions on the sale of non-essential goods. Also contributing to the decrease in core retail sales were electronics and appliance stores (-12.8%) and furniture and home furnishings stores (-7.0%). These declines followed increases in November, which saw record gains in several commodity groups within these subsectors as a result of a prolonged Black Friday and an earlier Christmas spending season. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers decline for a second straight month Continuing their decline from November, sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers contracted 1.4% in December—the largest decline since April. The decrease was driven by lower sales at new car dealers (-3.2%). According to the New Motor Vehicle Sales Survey, sales of new motor vehicles declined 1.0% (not seasonally adjusted) year over year in December. Sales at gasoline stations increased for the first time in four months, rising 0.3% in December. Growth was largely the result of higher gasoline prices. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations were down 3.4%. Chart 2 Sales down in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales down in every province for the first time since April Sales decreased in every province in December, led by Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba. In Ontario, sales decreased 6.5%, with motor vehicle and parts dealers reporting the largest decline. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, sales were down 9.6%. In the second half of December, Ontario was under renewed lockdown measures that prohibited in-store shopping at many non-essential retailers and enforced stricter physical distancing measures at essential retailers. Sales in British Columbia fell 2.2% in December, driven by lower sales at general merchandise stores. Sales were down 2.1% in the CMA of Vancouver. In Manitoba, sales declined for the third month in a row, falling 7.2% in December on lower sales at general merchandise stores. Public health measures that began in mid-November and continued on into December led to the closure of non-essential retailers and restricted the sale of non-essential items at essential retailers in Manitoba. Chart 3 Retail sales decline in all provinces Retail e-commerce continues to climb On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales reached a record high in December, increasing by over two-thirds (+69.3%) year over year to $4.7 billion in December. In comparison, total unadjusted retail sales increased 5.9% on a year-over-year basis in December. E-commerce accounted for 7.8% of total retail trade in December—the largest share since May. The rise in e-commerce sales coincided with an uptick in the number of retailers reporting shutdowns in December. When adjusted for basic seasonal effects, retail e-commerce sales increased 1.1%. Chart 4 Retail e-commerce increases in December Retail sales in 2020 The COVID-19 pandemic led consumers to change their shopping habits and retailers to change their business practices, and this impacted retail sales. Both faced a rapidly changing retail environment as protective measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 resulted in the temporary closure of stores deemed non-essential, along with other physical distancing measures. This in turn changed the way consumers bought goods, as well as how they shopped. Canadian retailers finished 2020 with $606 billion in sales, down 1.4% from 2019. This was the largest annual decline since the 2009 recession, as the onset of COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 and related health measures led to the temporary closure of many non-essential brick-and-mortar retailers across the country. Limitations on in-person shopping and gatherings also contributed to a 1.7% volume decline in sales, also the largest drop since 2009. Ontario (-3.4%) and Alberta (-2.5%) led the national decline in retail sales, with the provinces of Nova Scotia (-2.0%), Quebec (-0.4%) and Saskatchewan (-1.1%) also posting declines. In contrast, sales in British Columbia increased 2.3%. Sales were also up in Manitoba (+0.6%), New Brunswick (+1.2%), Newfoundland and Labrador (+1.2%), and Prince Edward Island (+1.5%). Retail e-commerce sales soar In the spring of 2020, temporary store closures and physical distancing measures made online shopping a more attractive and accessible alternative to the in-store experience. Many brick-and-mortar retailers were quick to adopt and promote online sales. As a result, retail e-commerce sales increased 70.5% in 2020. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail trade reached a record-high 9.8% in April, when most non-essential retailers were mandated to close their storefronts across the country. Retail e-commerce sales accounted for 5.9% of total retail sales in 2020, up from 3.5% in 2019. The onset of COVID-19 prompted many Canadian retailers to open or expand their e-commerce presence, quickly changing the retail landscape. Lower sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers Motor vehicle and parts dealers (-8.8%) led the decline in retail sales in 2020, outpacing the subsector's previous record decline in 2009 (-6.1%). Sales at new car dealers, which accounted for about one-fifth of total retail sales, declined 11.5% in 2020. Dealership closures during the early months of the pandemic more than offset strong sales during the summer, which saw a rebound in household spending combined with pent-up demand. According to the New Motor Vehicle Sales Survey, sales of new motor vehicles declined 18.0% in 2020. Accounting for just under 1/10 of total retail sales, sales at gasoline stations declined 17.8% in 2020. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations fell 10.9%. Stay-at-home orders and lockdown measures in several regions throughout the year decreased domestic demand for gasoline. The price of gasoline was also lower in 2020 because of temporary business closures and lower global economic activity. Core retail sales rise In 2020, core retail sales rose at over twice the pace (+4.5%) compared with 2019 (+2.1%), with food and beverage stores, general merchandise stores, and building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers leading the gain. Sales declined at clothing and clothing accessories stores. Sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores—deemed essential at the start of the pandemic—increased 11.5% in 2020. Part of the increase was attributable to a record sales surge in March (+28.7%) amid panic buying of non-perishable goods during the early stages of the pandemic. Sales declined thereafter but remained at elevated levels compared with 2019. Higher prices also contributed to the sales increase, with prices for fresh vegetables and meat products up compared with 2019. Sales at general merchandise stores, many of which were deemed essential, increased 7.2% in 2020. With consumers spending a lot more time at home, sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers increased 11.4% in 2020. Growth in this subsector was largely attributable to increased spending on home improvement goods as purchases of hardware, tools, and renovation and lawn and garden products remained elevated beyond the summer months. Higher prices of lumber and household equipment also contributed to the year-over-year increase in 2020. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores declined by over one-quarter (-25.8%) in 2020—falling to their lowest level since 2011. Much of this decline was attributable to restrictions on in-store shopping at malls. From April to June, over half (57%) of retailers in this subsector were closed for at least one day. Lower prices also played a role in this decline as many retailers discounted online prices amid higher inventories. Cannabis sales more than double Marking the second full year of legal cannabis sales, sales at cannabis stores more than doubled (+120.5%) in 2020 on higher demand. Prices faced downward pressure as cannabis companies competed with the illicit market, coupled with increased competition as more companies entered the market. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are the exact same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. For information regarding cannabis statistics, consult the Cannabis Stats Hub. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they too are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales in the food services and drinking places subsector fell 8.0% to $4.2 billion in December 2020. Decreased sales were reported in full-service restaurants (-18.3%), limited-service restaurants (-1.9%) and drinking places (-18.9%). Sales increased 5.5% in special food services. Lower sales were reported in seven provinces with Ontario (-9.9%) and Alberta (-16.2%) posting the largest decreases. Chart 1 Sales in food services and drinking places Further information is available in the Food Services and Drinking Places Sales dashboard, which provides access to data on sales in food services and drinking places for Canada and by province and territory. This application allows users to compare provincial and territorial data through interactive maps and charts. COVID-19 pandemic takes a bite out of restaurant sales The figures in this section are based on seasonally unadjusted estimates. In 2020, the food services and drinking places subsector was directly affected by measures imposed by the government and by anxiety among Canadians about the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in March, all provinces imposed restrictions and closures. Large-scale business losses were experienced across the subsector, with unadjusted sales falling 28.2% in 2020 compared with 2019. With many dining rooms closed across the country, restaurants transitioned to take-out and delivery as their primary means of conducting business. Best-positioned to make this transition, limited-service eating places saw sales decline by 13.4% in 2020. In comparison, over the same period, full-service restaurants saw a far greater decrease in sales (-37.5%), partly because of their larger share of sales coming from alcoholic beverages (18.8% in 2019). Drinking places and special food services saw the largest decreases in 2020 because of full closures and limitations on indoor gatherings. Sales at drinking places declined 47.8% and sales of special food services were down 48.3% in 2020. The largest decreases in both dollar and percentage terms were in the most populous provinces: Ontario (-31.1%), Quebec (-31.3%), British Columbia (-25.4%) and Alberta (-24.6%). Prices continued to rise in the subsector as the prices for food purchased from restaurants increased 2.2% in 2020 compared with 2019, while the prices for alcoholic beverages served in licensed establishments increased 1.4% over the same period.

At the same time, the youngest households recorded the largest gain in their net worth (+9.8%). These changes were driven by unprecedented increases in transfers to households, as the value of government COVID-19 support measures exceeded losses in wages and salaries and self-employment income. As the pandemic unfolded in Canada, households experienced extraordinary changes in their economic well-being. While quarterly releases of gross domestic product and the national balance sheet provide an aggregate view of these impacts, new experimental sub-annual distributions of household economic accounts (DHEA), released today, provide insight into how the pandemic and the associated government support measures have affected the economic well-being of different groups of households in Canada. Gap between lowest- and highest-income households declines in 2020 Although the everyday experiences of particular households may have differed, on average, the gap in household disposable income between the lowest- and highest-income earners declined in 2020. Households in the lowest income quintile increased their share of disposable income from 6.1% in the first quarter to a high of 7.2% in the second quarter of 2020, while those in the highest income quintile decreased their share from 40.1% to 37.7% over the same period. Changes in income distribution were led by strong growth in current transfers received by the lowest-income households as the value of government COVID-19 support measures exceeded losses in wages and salaries and self-employment income. Chart 1 Distribution of household disposable income by income quintile, first to third quarter 2020 Stronger rebound in disposable income for lower-income and younger households In the early months of 2020, because of volatility in financial markets and as the emergence of COVID-19 cases led to various restrictions in economic activity across the country, disposable income declined for all households in Canada. Led by significant increases in government support measures, household disposable income rebounded in the second quarter, with the largest gains for the lowest-income earners (+33.6%) and youngest households (+20.1%). Hypothetically, if the federal government had not introduced its support measures to counteract the negative impacts of the pandemic, overall household disposable income would have fallen by 3.6% in the second quarter. The largest declines would have occurred for middle- and lower-income earners, as well as younger households. As the economy began to recover in the third quarter of 2020, relatively muted gains in disposable income occurred for higher-income earners (+5.5%) and workers aged 55 to 64 (+6.1%), while lower-income earners and younger households held onto gains achieved earlier in the second quarter. Chart 2 Change in average household disposable income by income quintile, first to third quarter 2020 Chart 3 Change in average household disposable income by age group of major income earner, first to third quarter 2020 Lowest-income and youngest households experience largest decline in wages and salaries As the pandemic began to unfold in Canada, compensation of employees, of which wages and salaries are the biggest component, fell the most in the first quarter of 2020 for lower-income earners (-3.7% for the lowest income quintile and -2.3% for the second income quintile) and the youngest households (-1.6%). As more economic restrictions were implemented to combat the spread of the virus, wages and salaries declined for all households in the second quarter, with lower-income households recording the steepest losses. As economic restrictions were loosened in many parts of the country throughout the summer, wages and salaries rebounded in the third quarter, with notable gains for all households. Despite these improvements, wages and salaries did not return to their first-quarter level for many households, except those with a major income earner younger than 35 or aged 55 or older. Mixed income, earned through self-employment, declined for all households in both the first and the second quarters of 2020, with the largest cumulative declines occurring for the lowest-income households (-31.9%), as well as those with a major income earner aged 55 to 64 (-17.2%). As with wages and salaries, self-employment income rebounded sharply in the third quarter as economic activity recovered. The same households that saw the biggest declines in self-employment income in the first two quarters recorded the largest gains in the third quarter. The value of COVID-19 support measures exceeds losses in wages and salaries and self-employment income The introduction of various COVID-19 support measures led to an unprecedented increase in current transfers (+57.6%) to all households in the second quarter of 2020. Although households did experience notable declines both in wages and salaries and in self-employment income in the second quarter, the value of COVID-19 support measures provided by governments more than compensated for those losses. The difference between the value of COVID-19 support measures and decreased wages and salaries and self-employment income in the second quarter was most pronounced for middle-income households, as on average they gained roughly $2,500 more than they lost. On average, young and middle-aged households gained around $3,000 more through COVID-19 support measures than they lost in wages and salaries and self-employment income in the second quarter. As lockdowns were eased and people returned to work in the third quarter, the value of government COVID-19 support measures declined for all households. Still, households received on average between $1,000 and $2,600 through COVID-19 support measures in the third quarter of 2020. Chart 4 Average change in employment earnings compared with the value of COVID-19 support measures, by income quintile, second quarter 2020 Chart 5 Average change in employment earnings compared with the value of COVID-19 support measures, by age group of household major income earner, second quarter 2020 COVID-19 support measures have largest impact on lower-income and younger households Although a larger proportion of the total value of government COVID-19 support measures went to middle- and upper-income earners and middle-aged households, the impact of the benefits was greater for lower-income and younger households. Over the first three quarters of 2020, the value of government COVID-19 support measures represented 16.4% of disposable income for the lowest-income earners and 11.3% for the youngest households, compared with 4.3% for the highest-income earners and 4.2% for the oldest households. Households increase their net saving in 2020 Households experienced unprecedented gains in net saving in 2020 because of a combination of higher disposable income, driven by the introduction of COVID-19 support measures, and lower consumer spending as a result of lockdowns that limited economic activity. While all households increased their net saving in the second quarter, the improvement did not carry through to the third quarter for the lowest-income households. Middle-income earners saw some of the biggest improvements, as they moved from a net dissaving to a net saving position—the first time that this has been observed for middle-income earners in the DHEA estimates, which date back to 1999. Lowest-income and youngest households see largest gains in wealth Similar to the trends in net saving, households increased their wealth in 2020 despite negative economic pressures introduced by the pandemic. Relative to 2019, household net worth grew by 5.2% up to the third quarter of 2020, reaching an average of $786,000 per household. However, households did not benefit equally from the overall increase in net worth. Wealth for households in the lowest quintile of disposable income grew more than for other households, up 6.3% as of the third quarter of 2020 relative to 2019, compared with 4.8% for those in the highest income quintile. Gains in net worth for the lowest-income households occurred as increases in the value of their real estate holdings outweighed increases in the value of mortgage debt acquisitions, while they reduced their non-mortgage debt balances more than higher-income households. Meanwhile, fluctuations in wealth for the highest-income earners were driven more by volatility in financial markets, as they held more in investment funds relative to lower-income earners. The highest 20% of income earners accounted for 55% of the $470 billion reduction in the value of financial assets that occurred in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the end of 2019. Similarly, along with a recovery in financial markets, the highest-income earners accounted for more than half of the subsequent $677 billion increase in financial asset values as of the end of the third quarter of 2020. The trends in net worth also varied by age. Although households with a major income earner younger than 35 held the least wealth of any age group as of the third quarter of 2020, at $220,200, compared with almost $1.3 million for those with a major income earner aged 55 to 64, they increased their average net worth by more than older households. Driven by gains in value in the acquisition of real estate and consumer goods—such as cars, appliances and electronics—that outpaced growth in debt obligations, households with a major income earner younger than 35 grew their net worth by 7.7%, while net worth for those with a major income earner aged 55 or older grew by 4.7%. Chart 6 Quarterly change in net worth by age group of household major income earner, indexed to fourth quarter 2019 Low lending rates facilitate home buying for lower-income and younger households Although the pandemic greatly reduced job security for many households in 2020, lower-income earners and younger households acquired mortgage debt at a faster pace than other households as they were encouraged by dramatically reduced mortgage lending rates offered by financial institutions. While mortgage lending rates dropped to historic lows, falling to about 2% by the end of the third quarter, average mortgage debt for the lowest-income households increased 5.4% from the end of 2019, while households with a major income earner younger than 35 increased their mortgage debt by 5.8%. Even though lower-income earners (+7.7%) and younger households (+7.9%) increased their mortgage liabilities by more than other households, they were also less leveraged as real estate values grew at an even faster pace. From the end of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020, the ratio of mortgage debt to real estate assets decreased from 32.9% to 32.2% for the lowest-income earners, and from 51.7% to 50.7% for the youngest age group. Meanwhile, because of relatively limited real estate acquisitions for higher-income earners and older age groups, their ratio of mortgage debt to real estate assets remained unchanged, at around 20.0% for those in the highest income quintile, about 19.0% for those aged 55 to 64 years, and close to 7.0% for those aged 65 years and older. Lower-income households limit balances on credit cards and non-mortgage loans Non-mortgage debt—credit card balances, car loans, etc.—fluctuated more than mortgage debt over time, as it decreased for households in each income quintile with the onset of the pandemic in the first half of the year, and then grew in the third quarter as lockdown measures were eased. Over the entire period, households in the lowest income quintile restricted their non-mortgage debt acquisitions more than other households. From the end of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020, average non-mortgage debt decreased by 1.8% for households in the lowest income quintile, compared with a reduction of 1.0% for those in the highest income quintile. Younger households limit non-mortgage borrowing despite acquiring more consumer goods Households with a major income earner younger than 45 tended to reduce their credit card and non-mortgage loan balances in the first half of 2020 and limited their borrowing to purchase consumer goods in the third quarter as restrictions on retail operations eased. Although the value of consumer goods held by those younger than 35 increased by 4.9% in the third quarter, the highest growth of any age group, most of these purchases were financed through savings or debt consolidation rather than through additional borrowing; their non-mortgage debt grew by 2.3% in that same quarter. The total value of consumer goods held by those younger than 35 was up 4.7% as of the third quarter of 2020 compared with 2019, while non-mortgage debt remained unchanged over that period. Chart 7 Average non-mortgage debt by age group of household major income earner, quarterly and cumulative change up to third quarter 2020 Large shifts in debt-to-income ratios for lower-income and younger households The debt-to-income ratio fluctuated greatly throughout 2020, especially for lower-income earners and younger workers. Along with reductions in income attributable to the onset of the pandemic, households in the lowest income quintile increased their ratio from 289.5% at the end of 2019 to 301.8% by the first quarter of 2020. Their ratio dropped to 227.0% in the second quarter as governments introduced support measures for those who lost their jobs or had a reduction in work hours. As business shutdowns eased in the third quarter, the debt-to-income ratio for the lowest-income earners stabilized as they regained employment or increased their hours of work. In contrast with other households, the debt-to-income ratio for those in the second income quintile grew by 4.7 percentage points, reaching 182.2% in the third quarter, because of a combination of increased mortgage debt and reductions in government benefits that outweighed gains in employment income. While the debt-to-income ratio for younger and core-age workers benefited from the introduction of a range of government benefits in the second quarter of 2020 to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic, ratio reductions for those aged 55 and older were driven by a combination of reduced debt and moderate growth in disposable income. In contrast with other age groups, households with a major income earner younger than 35 increased their debt-to-income ratio in the latter half of 2020, rising from 186.7% in the second quarter to 191.8% in the third quarter. Similar to lower-income earners, the youngest households increased their debt-to-income ratio in the third quarter as increased mortgage acquisitions outweighed income gains. Despite recent increases in the debt-to-income ratio for lower-income and younger households, their ratios remained far below those that existed prior to the pandemic. As the economy continues to evolve in response to the challenges introduced by the pandemic, future DHEA releases will shed further light on the state of household economic well-being, including developments in the trends for income, consumption, saving and wealth. Table 1 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Table 2 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Table 3 Net worth, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Table 4 Net worth, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Note to readers Statistics Canada regularly publishes macroeconomic indicators on household disposable income, final consumption expenditure, net saving and wealth as part of the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (CSMA). These accounts are aligned with the most recent international standards and are compiled for all sectors of the economy, including households, non-profit institutions, governments and corporations, along with Canada's financial position vis-à-vis the rest of the world. While the CSMA provides high-quality information on the overall position of households relative to other economic sectors, the distributions of household economic accounts (DHEA) provide additional granularity to address questions such as vulnerabilities of specific groups and the resulting implications for economic well-being and financial stability, and are an important complement to standard quarterly outputs related to the economy. The sub-annual DHEA estimates released today provide experimental estimates of income, consumption, saving and wealth and their sub-components by various household distributions for the first three quarters of 2020. Annual estimates for 2019 have also been revised to include the latest CSMA benchmarks. As with all data, these experimental sub-annual DHEA estimates are not without their limitations. For the most part, these experimental data rely on the same concepts and methods as the annual DHEA. However, to produce the DHEA on a sub-annual basis, new data sources were used and assumptions were made. DHEA estimates for wages and salaries were derived using Statistics Canada's Social Policy Simulation Database and Model, which incorporates data from the Labour Force Survey for employment by industry and wage level. The distributions of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit were aligned with microdata from Employment and Social Development Canada. Aggregate data on DHEA liabilities were distributed to household groups using sub-aggregate data purchased from a consumer credit rating agency. Because of scarcity in available microdata sources, aggregate estimates of DHEA household final consumption expenditure and household assets were allocated according to the DHEA distributions for reference year 2019. In an effort to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic well-being of households in Canada, these experimental DHEA estimates hold constant the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 2019 when estimating changes in income, consumption, saving and wealth throughout the first three quarters of 2020. It is therefore assumed that all households remained in their same distributional category as they did in the 2019 DHEA (e.g., age group, equivalized disposable income quintile, household composition). By holding constant the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of 2019, it is possible to estimate changes in various household economic indicators without intersecting changes from households moving across distributional groups. This approach allows for a clearer identification of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on household distributions, as well as the associated impacts of economic restrictions and government support measures on household economic well-being. The DHEA estimates released today are benchmarked to the quarterly income and expenditure accounts and the national balance sheet accounts published in December 2020. All values are expressed in quarterly nominal unadjusted rates, unless otherwise specified.

From 2002 to 2019, labour productivity grew 22.1% in digitally intensive sectors—more than three times higher than in non-digitally intensive sectors. Over the past two decades, Canada has embraced digital technologies at an unprecedented pace and breadth as businesses and individuals have relied increasingly on digital products and services. Two articles released today in Economic and Social Reports provide results from a new composite index developed by Statistics Canada researchers to provide a comprehensive measure of digitalization so that its impact on the Canadian economy can be better analyzed and understood. The articles released today use the index to describe the intensity of digitalization in Canadian industries, as well as to measure and compare the economic performance between sectors in which digital inputs have been used more intensively in the production process and those in which they have not. High but uneven growth of digital intensification across industries The final composite index suggests that Canada's economy-wide digital intensity increased continually from 2000 to 2015, growing by more than 60% across industries. However, this intensification of digitalization has been uneven across industries. Digital intensity in some industries was high at the beginning of the sample period and grew markedly over time. These industries were information services; telecommunications; professional, scientific and technical services; machinery, computer and electronic product manufacturing; and transportation equipment manufacturing. The digital intensity of other industries such as agriculture, mining and construction, as well as most manufacturing and transportation industries, was low in the beginning and increased slightly over the period. The composite index can also be used to rank industries based on their digital intensities. A digitally intensive sector can be defined as having an intensity within the top quartile. For the period from 2013 to 2015, the digitally intensive sectors were utilities; plastics and rubber products; primary metal manufacturing; machinery manufacturing; computer and electronic product manufacturing; transportation equipment manufacturing; pipeline transportation; publishing and data processing; broadcasting and telecommunications; and professional, scientific and technical services. In contrast, agriculture, construction, food product manufacturing, and accommodation and food services were ranked among the least digitally intensive industries. This characterization of digitally intensive sectors provides a useful tool for future studies on the effects of digitalization on the economy and quality of life that will help inform and measure the impact of policy. For information on the other articles released today in Economic and Social Reports please see the Economic and Social Reports release. Note to readers Multidimensional metrics were constructed to measure the extent to which firms use digital inputs to produce goods and services, and the analysis uses data on information and communications technology (ICT) capital, the use of intermediate ICT goods and services, digital workforce, and robot adoption. The metrics are then aggregated into a single composite index based on weights derived from a principal component analysis. Products The Spotlight on Data and Research article titled ""Economic performance associated with digitalization in Canada over the past two decades"" and the study titled ""Measuring digital intensity in the Canadian economy,"" part of Economic and Social Reports, February 2021 (36-28-0001), are now available.

The article ""Workers' responses to job loss when employment opportunities are scarce"" provides insight into how workers laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic might adjust by examining the way workers responded to 2009 job losses following the 2008-2009 recession. In 2010, between 4% and 6% of laid-off workers entered postsecondary education. Close to 6% changed economic regions from the year prior to job loss (2008) to the year following job loss (2010). Slightly more than 4% moved into unincorporated self-employment in 2010. In contrast, no more than 1% started a registered apprenticeship. The use of these strategies varied by worker characteristics. International students earn less than Canadians after graduation Securing a good paying job could be more difficult for international students graduating from Canadian institutions compared with Canadian students. Results in the article ""Early earnings trajectories of international students after graduation from postsecondary programs"" show that international students who graduated from 2010 to 2012 earned 11% less in the first year after graduation than students with Canadian citizenship and 12% less five years after graduation. The earnings gap in the first year after graduation was particularly large among those with a master's degree (40%) and doctoral degree (35%). These gaps decreased to 26% and 10%, respectively, in the fifth year after graduation. Field of study was also a factor. This disadvantage could be because international students were much less likely to gain work experience before graduation than were students with Canadian citizenship. About 44% of international students had no Canadian work experience before graduation, compared with 2% of students with Canadian citizenship. Limited years of residence in Canada, language proficiency, cultural differences, academic performance, and employers' inability to recruit and train job applicants with temporary residency status may all be factors in international students' having less pre-graduation work experience. In addition, some government programs that help Canadian students gain paid work experience are not available to international students.

December data are now available from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), which provides monthly information on payroll employment, earnings and hours worked in Canada, the provinces and the territories. The SEPH provides an account of payroll employment, that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. Preliminary monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are also now available for December. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), data from the SEPH and JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions. Payroll employment increases in December The number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer—measured in the SEPH as payroll employment—rose by 44,200 (+0.3%) in December, after decreasing by 64,500 (-0.4%) in November. The largest increases were in health care and social assistance, and transportation and warehousing. December gains were tempered by declines in accommodation and food services; retail trade; and arts, entertainment and recreation. The total number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer was 1.1 million (-6.2%) lower than in February 2020. The December LFS—for the week of December 6 to 12—recorded a decrease of 53,000 (-0.3%) in the number of people with a job or business, with the largest declines in accommodation and food services; ""other services""; and information, culture and recreation. Employment declines were in self-employment and part-time work. In December, public health measures introduced earlier in the fall remained in place for Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as for the Halifax Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island entered a two-week lockdown on December 7. In Quebec, in addition to the measures already implemented, non-essential retail businesses were closed effective December 25. In Ontario, restrictions already in place for some regions of southern Ontario—including the closure of non-essential retail businesses—were extended to the rest of the province effective December 26. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in December after a dip in the previous month Payroll employment changes in December vary by province Payroll employment increased in five provinces in December and decreased in four. Increases were in Ontario (+0.6%; +37,800), Quebec (+0.4%; +13,500), New Brunswick (+0.7%; +2,100), Newfoundland and Labrador (+0.6%; +1,100), and Prince Edward Island (+1.1%; +700). In contrast, payroll employment declined in Manitoba (-0.9%; -5,400), Alberta (-0.3%; -5,200), Saskatchewan (-0.5%; -2,400) and Nova Scotia (-0.3%; -1,400). In December, the three Maritime provinces were closest to pre-COVID-19 employment levels, led by New Brunswick, at 0.5% below the level in February, followed by Prince Edward Island (-2.5%) and Nova Scotia (-3.9%). Little change in average weekly earnings in December Average weekly earnings were $1,112 in December, little changed compared with November. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 6.4%, as job losses since February have been concentrated among hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees. In December, the number of hourly paid employees was 8.9% below its pre-COVID-19 level, compared with a gap of 2.8% for salaried employees. Total hours worked and average hours worked per week hold steady Total hours worked were little changed in December and 5.3% below their pre-COVID-19 February level, compared with a gap of 16.6% in May. Average hours worked per week were also little changed, at 33.6 hours. Rise in payroll employment driven by services-producing sector In December, payroll employment rose in the services-producing sector (+0.2%; +31,900), nearly offsetting the loss in the previous month. December gains were spread across a number of sectors but largest in health care and social assistance (+22,400), and transportation and warehousing (+10,500). At the same time, there were notable losses in accommodation and food services (-32,900); retail trade (-5,600); and arts, entertainment and recreation (-3,600). Employment in the goods-producing sector was little changed for a second consecutive month. Prior to this, employment in the goods-producing sector had been trending up since May. In December, payroll employment in the services-producing sector and the goods-producing sector was 6.5% and 4.6% below pre-COVID-19 levels, respectively. Health care and social assistance sector surpasses pre-COVID-19 level of employment The upward trend in payroll employment in health care and social assistance continued in December, with the number of payroll jobs rising by 22,400 (+1.1%) month over month. This brought employment in the sector to 0.8% above its pre-COVID-19 level. The December rise in payroll employment in this sector was spread across ambulatory health care services (+8,600), nursing and residential care facilities (+5,800), social assistance (+4,300), and hospitals (+3,700). Most of the growth in health care and social assistance in the fourth quarter of 2020 was in the ambulatory health care services and social assistance subsectors. Average weekly earnings in health care and social assistance were $1,029 in December, up 7.1% compared with 12 months earlier. Recovery resumes in transportation and warehousing Payroll employment increased in transportation and warehousing (+10,500; +1.4%) in December, after a decrease of 4,800 (-0.6%) in November. The increase in this sector coincided with a holiday season marked by online shopping as in-person shopping and in-person gatherings were limited in many provinces as a result of public health restrictions. Within the sector, the largest payroll employment increases were concentrated in subsectors related to online shopping and mail and parcel delivery—led by postal service (+2,400; +3.2%), warehousing and storage (+1,700; +2.7%), and truck transportation (+1,700; +0.8%). On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in the transportation and warehousing sector grew 5.7% to $1,178. Payroll employment up in professional, scientific and technical services for seventh consecutive month Payroll employment rose for the seventh consecutive month in professional, scientific and technical services, up 6,700 (+0.7%) in December. A relatively small share of jobs in this sector—which includes computer systems design services and advertising and related services—require close physical proximity to others, limiting the impact of public health measures on the sector. The December gain was spread across nearly all industries, with the largest increases in computer systems design and related services (+3,200) and architectural, engineering and related services (+1,700). Most of the employment growth in the sector was in Ontario. In December, payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services was 0.5% below the February level. Scientific research and development services were the furthest above their pre-pandemic level (+5.9%), followed by computer systems design and related services (+3.9%), while advertising, public relations, and related services were the furthest below their February level (-9.1%). Year over year, average weekly earnings in professional, scientific and technical services were up 3.6% to $1,496. This sector is among the highest paying in Canada. Accommodation and food services, and arts, entertainment and recreation continue to decline Payroll employment in accommodation and food services fell for the second consecutive month, down 3.4% (-32,900) in December, with declines in all provinces except Prince Edward Island. The largest losses were in full-service restaurants and limited-service eating places, traveller accommodation, and drinking places. This brought payroll employment in accommodation and food services to 30.4% below the February level. Sales in the food services and drinking places subsector fell for a third consecutive month, down 8.0% to $4.2 billion in December. On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in accommodation and food services rose 3.6% to $443. Payroll employment in arts, entertainment and recreation also declined for a second month in a row, down 1.7% (-3,600) in December, the result of losses in other amusement and recreation industries, which include skiing facilities, as well as recreational, sports and fitness centres. Compared with February, employment in the sector was down 32.0%. On a year-over-year basis, average weekly earnings in arts, entertainment and recreation were up 17.2% to $711 in December. Payroll employment in tourism-related industries declines for a second month in a row After trending upward from May to September, payroll employment in tourism-related industries—a total of 27 industries mostly in transportation; arts, entertainment and recreation; and accommodation and food services—fell 6.3% (-98,700) from October to December. Many provinces have implemented targeted public health measures since September in response to a rise in COVID-19 cases. With this decline, employment in tourism-related industries was 27.3% (-549,100) below its February level, accounting for over half (51.8%) of the overall payroll employment decline. First payroll employment decline in retail trade since May Payroll employment in retail trade declined by 0.3% (-5,600) in December, following six consecutive months of increases. Notable declines were recorded in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-6,200), and health and personal care stores (-2,700). At the same time, employment increased in food and beverage stores (+3,200). Most of the decline in the sector was observed in Ontario. Since the closure of non-essential retail businesses occurred towards the end of December in Quebec and Ontario, many employees affected by this measure likely received pay after the shutdown and would have been counted in December payroll employment. In December, retail sales posted their largest decline (-3.4%) since the low of April driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Employment in retail trade was 4.5% below its February level in December, with the number of payroll jobs in clothing and clothing accessories stores continuing to be the furthest from its pre-pandemic level (-18.9%). Average weekly earnings in retail trade were $632, up 1.1% compared with December 2019. Monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey In December, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 478,000 positions (not seasonally adjusted) as they continued to navigate COVID-19 and the associated public health measures. The job vacancy rate, which represents vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied) was 3.0% in December, following a rate of 3.3% in November and 3.5% in October (not seasonally adjusted). While monthly and quarterly job vacancy statistics are not directly comparable because of seasonal patterns and month-to-month variations within quarters, prior to the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the quarterly job vacancy rate ranged from 3.0% to 3.5% between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. The job vacancy rate is a key measure of unmet labour demand and, in conjunction with other indicators such as payroll employment and the unemployment rate, provides valuable insight into the labour market. For example, a high job vacancy rate could represent either an increased pace of recruiting or difficulty on the part of employers in finding or retaining suitable candidates. Health care and social assistance sector continues to have the most vacancies In December, the health care and social assistance sector continued to have the highest number of job vacancies (95,000), and it had a job vacancy rate of 4.4% (not seasonally adjusted), the second-highest job vacancy rate of any sector. From October to December, the monthly job vacancy rate for this sector was higher than the quarterly rates observed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate ranged from 3.0% to 3.3% between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Retail trade had the second-highest number of vacancies (51,800) in December and a job vacancy rate of 2.6% (not seasonally adjusted). The number of job vacancies in this sector can vary largely based on seasonal patterns. Job vacancies in retail trade were lower in December than in November (69,700) and October (92,800), when retail businesses were recruiting more in preparation for the holiday season. Provincially, the highest job vacancy rates were in British Columbia (3.6%) and Quebec (3.5%) (not seasonally adjusted). These two provinces have consistently had the highest job vacancy rates since monthly job vacancy statistics became available in October 2020, and they had among the highest job vacancy rates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Job vacancy rates were lowest in Alberta (1.9%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (2.0%). A more detailed analysis on job vacancies (by occupation and economic region, for example) will be released with the quarterly estimates (October to December 2020) of the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey on March 23, 2021. Looking ahead January SEPH results—to be released on March 30—will provide detailed information on the subsectors that continue to be most affected by the reimplementation and tightening of public health measures to control the spread of COVID-19. In particular—and building on the January LFS results—these results will shed further light on the impacts of the province-wide closure of non-essential retail businesses in Quebec and Ontario at the end of December. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers With the March 30 release of January 2021 estimates, seasonally adjusted data will be revised based on the latest seasonal factors. Seasonally adjusted estimates will be revised historically back to 2001. In addition to the new seasonal factors, historical revisions will be made for a small number of industries (four-digit level of the North American Industry Classification System [NAICS]). The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees, and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, data on average weekly hours are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupations for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wage and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. In addition, year-over-year comparisons between estimates of different frequencies (month vs. quarter) should be interpreted with caution as job vacancy statistics can vary from month to month within a quarter. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on March 15, 2021. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours and job vacancies for January 2021 will be released on March 30, 2021.

It started out like any other year, with Canadians mingling freely, celebrating the New Year by visiting family or friends at their homes, going to concerts, sporting events, parties, restaurants and bars. We travelled freely inside the country and around the world. Then, in March, everything changed. The year ended with our borders closed to all but essential travel, with much of country under a second lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19. Most Canadians spent the New Year holiday inside a small bubble or at home alone. Our economy was 3.3% (correction) smaller at year end. Millions of Canadians were temporarily underemployed or out of work at some point last year. Almost 16,000 Canadians had died from COVID-19, making it the third leading cause of death in 2020, following cancer and heart disease. About 85% fewer Americans and overseas residents visited us last year, while 75% fewer Canadians returned home from abroad. Perhaps not surprisingly, almost 40% of Canadians said they had become more downcast since the onset of the pandemic. This was also a downturn like no other, with sectors of the economy thriving, such as online sales, housing, forestry and crop farming. Despite the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic, Canadians and businesses adapted to the new reality and carried on, caring for the most vulnerable at hospitals and nursing homes, working in shops and factories, and for those that could, increasingly working from home. What we learned How do we know all this? Because you told us, millions of you. We asked Canadians and businesses how they were doing over the course of the year and they shared how they fared during a year of massive economic and social disruption. Thousands of Canadians voluntarily participated in the rapid response crowdsourcing surveys we conducted in 2020, and tens of thousands more responded to our regular surveys. We gleaned more data still from administrative sources to reduce respondent burden while, as always, respecting and protecting personal data. COVID-19 in Canada: A one-year update on social and economic impacts We would now like to share what we have learned through a compendium of tables that track a year of record highs and lows. Analysts from across the agency have crunched the numbers and quantified and described the level of change in their field of expertise through a series of statistical vignettes of charts, text and tables. This year-in-review compendium updates and extends our analysis of the pandemic's effects on the health, and social and economic lives of Canadians, based largely on information collected in late 2020 as public health measures began to tighten in response to the resurgence of COVID-19. It is organized around several key themes: • How are Canadians adapting and responding to public health measures, and which socioeconomic factors are most related to vaccine hesitancy? • What are the unintended consequences of the pandemic for the health of Canadians, including the implications of COVID-19 for excess mortality, cancer screening and mental health? • To what extent have social and economic disparities widened as a result of the pandemic, given the disproportionate impacts of public health measures on more socially and financially vulnerable groups? • What are the potential structural impacts of the pandemic on Canada's economy? How much financial uncertainty are businesses facing as support measures remain in place while restrictions continue to tighten and ease? What are the potential implications of the pandemic for business investment, productivity and competitiveness. We hope this compendium will help you better understand how the pandemic has reshaped our lives. It provides a quick reference on the state of the recovery, especially as it pertains to recent changes in economic momentum, or to differences in the pace of the recovery across socioeconomic groups. Other analysis in this compendium speaks more directly to what may ultimately prove to be the transformative impacts of the pandemic, as they relate to the changing nature of work, or the types of investments and activities that enhance Canadians' social and economic well-being.

Beyond deaths attributed to the disease itself, the pandemic could also have indirect consequences that increase or decrease the number of deaths as a result of various factors, including delayed medical procedures or increased substance use. To understand both the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, it is important to measure excess mortality, which occurs when there are more deaths during a period of time than what would be expected for that period. It should be noted that, even without a pandemic, there is always some year-to-year variation in the number of people who die in a given week. This means that the number of expected deaths should fall within a certain range of values. Excess mortality occurs when the number of deaths exceeds that range. From January to mid-December 2020, there were an estimated 296,373 deaths in Canada, representing an excess of 13,798 deaths above and beyond what would have been expected had there been no pandemic. This is about 5% more deaths than expected in that period, after accounting for changes in the population, such as aging, and about 7% more deaths than the 277,276 observed within the same time frame in 2019. Today, as part of Statistics Canada's commitment to provide timely and relevant information on COVID-19 and its impact on Canadians, an updated provisional dataset from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database covering the period from January to mid-December is now available. Updates were also made to the provisional death estimates, which have been adjusted, where possible, to account for the incomplete nature of the counts. The provisional estimates will continue to be revised in future releases as more information is reported by provincial and territorial vital statistics agencies. The direct impacts of COVID-19 cannot fully account for the excess deaths observed in Canada in 2020, particularly in the fall In the early months of the pandemic, the weekly number of excess deaths and deaths caused by COVID-19 were closely aligned and mostly affected older populations, suggesting that COVID-19 itself was driving excess mortality in Canada. However, more recently, the number of excess deaths has been higher than the number of deaths due to COVID-19, and these deaths are affecting younger populations, suggesting that other factors, including possible indirect impacts of the pandemic, are now at play. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March to early June, there were 8,530 deaths where COVID-19 was the underlying cause, based on the medical certificate of cause of death. This exceeded the number of excess deaths (8,496) by under 1% over that period. The alignment at the start of the pandemic may not be surprising as it may have been too early for some of the possible indirect consequences of the pandemic to have an effect. At this time, excess mortality would have largely been driven by COVID-19 itself. Overall, during those first months of the pandemic, 86% of excess deaths occurred among individuals aged 65 and older. Similarly, COVID-19 deaths also disproportionately occurred in older populations during the March-to-early-June period. Approximately 94% of the deaths caused by COVID-19 involved individuals aged 65 and older. After several months during which deaths fell within the expected range, Canada once again experienced excess mortality at a national level beginning in September. From September to November, 3,626 excess deaths were reported nationally. Within this same period, there were 1,835 deaths reported to have been caused directly by COVID-19, although this number is expected to rise as more deaths are reported by the provinces and territories. In addition to the difference in the number of excess deaths and the number of deaths caused by COVID-19, the age groups affected by both were no longer as closely aligned in the fall as they were in the spring. Similar to what was observed in the spring, about 95% of the deaths directly caused by COVID-19 during the fall involved people aged 65 and older. However, during the fall of 2020, younger people became more heavily affected by excess deaths, as 35% of these deaths involved individuals under the age of 65, up from 14% in the spring. The number of deaths was 24% higher than expected for men aged under 45, followed by women aged 45 to 64, who recorded 14% more deaths than expected. By comparison, there were 6% more deaths than expected among those aged 85 and older during the fall period. As these shifts imply an increase in deaths not directly caused by COVID-19, it is important to note that some deaths may be due to the indirect consequences of the pandemic, which could include increases in mortality due to overdoses. For example, in British Columbia, the Chief Coroner's Office has reported increases in deaths due to overdoses since the start of the pandemic. Similarly, Alberta Health Services reported decreases in both the provision and use of substance use treatment programs as well as increases in opioid-related emergency responses and deaths since the onset of the pandemic. Overdose deaths disproportionately affect younger men. For example, according to a report by Alberta Health, between January 1 and June 30, 2020, 79% of apparent unintentional fentanyl overdoses were among men, with those aged 25 to 39 recording the highest proportions of such deaths. The number of provinces with excess deaths is increasing as the pandemic progresses The number of deaths reported during the fall also reflected a change in the distribution of excess mortality among the provinces. In the spring, more than half of excess deaths occurred in Quebec (52%). However, from September to November, about 15% of excess deaths occurred in that province. In fact, Quebec has not reported any significant excess mortality since June. Increased excess mortality in Alberta and British Columbia partly accounted for the shift. In the fall, there were 12% more deaths than expected in Alberta, up from 5% more deaths than expected in the spring. Similarly, for British Columbia, there were 9% more deaths than expected in the fall, compared with 6% in the spring. Excess mortality was also observed in the fall, for the first time, in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Saskatchewan and New Brunswick had 9% more deaths than expected over those months, while Nova Scotia reported 6% more deaths than expected. The share of excess deaths for Ontario was relatively similar in the spring (39%) and fall (40%). Deaths from other causes also up in some provinces in 2020 Statistics Canada also released today provisional data on the causes of death covering the period from January to mid-December 2020. The provisional results on causes of death, while not complete, do allow for some insight into changes in mortality during the pandemic. The cause of death has been reported for 94% of the deaths that occurred during the first period of excess mortality in Canada—from March to June. Based on data received to date, from March to June, the number of deaths from certain causes rose in several provinces compared with the same period in previous years. For example, the number of deaths caused by heart disease in Ontario rose from 4,125 in the spring of 2019 to 4,345 in the spring of 2020, which was higher than in the spring of any of the previous five years. While overdose deaths across Canada appeared to decline in 2019 from highs in 2017 and 2018, there are early signs of an increase in 2020. For example, Alberta reported 220 deaths caused by overdoses from March to June 2020, compared with 170 overdose deaths during same time period in 2019. This could be an early indication of the indirect impacts of the pandemic, in advance of the period when excess mortality started to trend among younger age groups. Note to readers The data released today are provisional as they are not based on all deaths that occurred during the reference period due to reporting delays, and do not include Yukon. Provisional death counts are based on what is reported to Statistics Canada by the provincial and territorial vital statistics registries. Provisional death estimates have been adjusted to account for incomplete data, where possible. The numbers of excess deaths discussed in this analysis refer to provisional estimates. Information on the methods used can be found in the Definitions, data sources and methods for Survey 3233 — Vital Statistics - Death Database. The provisional death counts and estimates released today for 2020 may not match figures from other sources, such as media reports, or counts and estimates from provincial or territorial health authorities and other agencies. Deaths due to COVID-19, are those for which COVID-19 was found to be the underlying cause of death, defined by the World Health Organization as the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death; or, as the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause of death is selected from the causes and conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death completed by a medical professional, medical examiner or coroner. These figures exclude cases where a cause might be listed on the medical certificate of cause of death but where it is not considered the underlying cause of death. While any rises in causes of death other than COVID-19 may be indirectly related to the pandemic, it is important to note that there is always some variation in the number of people who die from year to year. Unlike the analysis on excess deaths, comparing against previous figures for causes of death does not account for this variability nor does it account for other changes unrelated to COVID-19 such as population aging. More information on causes of death, including the certification and classification of COVID-19 deaths can be found in the study ""COVID-19 death comorbidities in Canada.""

At the same time, the youngest households recorded the largest gain in their net worth (+9.8%). These changes were driven by unprecedented increases in transfers to households, as the value of government COVID-19 support measures exceeded losses in wages and salaries and self-employment income. As the pandemic unfolded in Canada, households experienced extraordinary changes in their economic well-being. While quarterly releases of gross domestic product and the national balance sheet provide an aggregate view of these impacts, new experimental sub-annual distributions of household economic accounts (DHEA), released today, provide insight into how the pandemic and the associated government support measures have affected the economic well-being of different groups of households in Canada. Gap between lowest- and highest-income households declines in 2020 Although the everyday experiences of particular households may have differed, on average, the gap in household disposable income between the lowest- and highest-income earners declined in 2020. Households in the lowest income quintile increased their share of disposable income from 6.1% in the first quarter to a high of 7.2% in the second quarter of 2020, while those in the highest income quintile decreased their share from 40.1% to 37.7% over the same period. Changes in income distribution were led by strong growth in current transfers received by the lowest-income households as the value of government COVID-19 support measures exceeded losses in wages and salaries and self-employment income. Chart 1 Distribution of household disposable income by income quintile, first to third quarter 2020 Stronger rebound in disposable income for lower-income and younger households In the early months of 2020, because of volatility in financial markets and as the emergence of COVID-19 cases led to various restrictions in economic activity across the country, disposable income declined for all households in Canada. Led by significant increases in government support measures, household disposable income rebounded in the second quarter, with the largest gains for the lowest-income earners (+33.6%) and youngest households (+20.1%). Hypothetically, if the federal government had not introduced its support measures to counteract the negative impacts of the pandemic, overall household disposable income would have fallen by 3.6% in the second quarter. The largest declines would have occurred for middle- and lower-income earners, as well as younger households. As the economy began to recover in the third quarter of 2020, relatively muted gains in disposable income occurred for higher-income earners (+5.5%) and workers aged 55 to 64 (+6.1%), while lower-income earners and younger households held onto gains achieved earlier in the second quarter. Chart 2 Change in average household disposable income by income quintile, first to third quarter 2020 Chart 3 Change in average household disposable income by age group of major income earner, first to third quarter 2020 Lowest-income and youngest households experience largest decline in wages and salaries As the pandemic began to unfold in Canada, compensation of employees, of which wages and salaries are the biggest component, fell the most in the first quarter of 2020 for lower-income earners (-3.7% for the lowest income quintile and -2.3% for the second income quintile) and the youngest households (-1.6%). As more economic restrictions were implemented to combat the spread of the virus, wages and salaries declined for all households in the second quarter, with lower-income households recording the steepest losses. As economic restrictions were loosened in many parts of the country throughout the summer, wages and salaries rebounded in the third quarter, with notable gains for all households. Despite these improvements, wages and salaries did not return to their first-quarter level for many households, except those with a major income earner younger than 35 or aged 55 or older. Mixed income, earned through self-employment, declined for all households in both the first and the second quarters of 2020, with the largest cumulative declines occurring for the lowest-income households (-31.9%), as well as those with a major income earner aged 55 to 64 (-17.2%). As with wages and salaries, self-employment income rebounded sharply in the third quarter as economic activity recovered. The same households that saw the biggest declines in self-employment income in the first two quarters recorded the largest gains in the third quarter. The value of COVID-19 support measures exceeds losses in wages and salaries and self-employment income The introduction of various COVID-19 support measures led to an unprecedented increase in current transfers (+57.6%) to all households in the second quarter of 2020. Although households did experience notable declines both in wages and salaries and in self-employment income in the second quarter, the value of COVID-19 support measures provided by governments more than compensated for those losses. The difference between the value of COVID-19 support measures and decreased wages and salaries and self-employment income in the second quarter was most pronounced for middle-income households, as on average they gained roughly $2,500 more than they lost. On average, young and middle-aged households gained around $3,000 more through COVID-19 support measures than they lost in wages and salaries and self-employment income in the second quarter. As lockdowns were eased and people returned to work in the third quarter, the value of government COVID-19 support measures declined for all households. Still, households received on average between $1,000 and $2,600 through COVID-19 support measures in the third quarter of 2020. Chart 4 Average change in employment earnings compared with the value of COVID-19 support measures, by income quintile, second quarter 2020 Chart 5 Average change in employment earnings compared with the value of COVID-19 support measures, by age group of household major income earner, second quarter 2020 COVID-19 support measures have largest impact on lower-income and younger households Although a larger proportion of the total value of government COVID-19 support measures went to middle- and upper-income earners and middle-aged households, the impact of the benefits was greater for lower-income and younger households. Over the first three quarters of 2020, the value of government COVID-19 support measures represented 16.4% of disposable income for the lowest-income earners and 11.3% for the youngest households, compared with 4.3% for the highest-income earners and 4.2% for the oldest households. Households increase their net saving in 2020 Households experienced unprecedented gains in net saving in 2020 because of a combination of higher disposable income, driven by the introduction of COVID-19 support measures, and lower consumer spending as a result of lockdowns that limited economic activity. While all households increased their net saving in the second quarter, the improvement did not carry through to the third quarter for the lowest-income households. Middle-income earners saw some of the biggest improvements, as they moved from a net dissaving to a net saving position—the first time that this has been observed for middle-income earners in the DHEA estimates, which date back to 1999. Lowest-income and youngest households see largest gains in wealth Similar to the trends in net saving, households increased their wealth in 2020 despite negative economic pressures introduced by the pandemic. Relative to 2019, household net worth grew by 5.2% up to the third quarter of 2020, reaching an average of $786,000 per household. However, households did not benefit equally from the overall increase in net worth. Wealth for households in the lowest quintile of disposable income grew more than for other households, up 6.3% as of the third quarter of 2020 relative to 2019, compared with 4.8% for those in the highest income quintile. Gains in net worth for the lowest-income households occurred as increases in the value of their real estate holdings outweighed increases in the value of mortgage debt acquisitions, while they reduced their non-mortgage debt balances more than higher-income households. Meanwhile, fluctuations in wealth for the highest-income earners were driven more by volatility in financial markets, as they held more in investment funds relative to lower-income earners. The highest 20% of income earners accounted for 55% of the $470 billion reduction in the value of financial assets that occurred in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the end of 2019. Similarly, along with a recovery in financial markets, the highest-income earners accounted for more than half of the subsequent $677 billion increase in financial asset values as of the end of the third quarter of 2020. The trends in net worth also varied by age. Although households with a major income earner younger than 35 held the least wealth of any age group as of the third quarter of 2020, at $220,200, compared with almost $1.3 million for those with a major income earner aged 55 to 64, they increased their average net worth by more than older households. Driven by gains in value in the acquisition of real estate and consumer goods—such as cars, appliances and electronics—that outpaced growth in debt obligations, households with a major income earner younger than 35 grew their net worth by 7.7%, while net worth for those with a major income earner aged 55 or older grew by 4.7%. Chart 6 Quarterly change in net worth by age group of household major income earner, indexed to fourth quarter 2019 Low lending rates facilitate home buying for lower-income and younger households Although the pandemic greatly reduced job security for many households in 2020, lower-income earners and younger households acquired mortgage debt at a faster pace than other households as they were encouraged by dramatically reduced mortgage lending rates offered by financial institutions. While mortgage lending rates dropped to historic lows, falling to about 2% by the end of the third quarter, average mortgage debt for the lowest-income households increased 5.4% from the end of 2019, while households with a major income earner younger than 35 increased their mortgage debt by 5.8%. Even though lower-income earners (+7.7%) and younger households (+7.9%) increased their mortgage liabilities by more than other households, they were also less leveraged as real estate values grew at an even faster pace. From the end of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020, the ratio of mortgage debt to real estate assets decreased from 32.9% to 32.2% for the lowest-income earners, and from 51.7% to 50.7% for the youngest age group. Meanwhile, because of relatively limited real estate acquisitions for higher-income earners and older age groups, their ratio of mortgage debt to real estate assets remained unchanged, at around 20.0% for those in the highest income quintile, about 19.0% for those aged 55 to 64 years, and close to 7.0% for those aged 65 years and older. Lower-income households limit balances on credit cards and non-mortgage loans Non-mortgage debt—credit card balances, car loans, etc.—fluctuated more than mortgage debt over time, as it decreased for households in each income quintile with the onset of the pandemic in the first half of the year, and then grew in the third quarter as lockdown measures were eased. Over the entire period, households in the lowest income quintile restricted their non-mortgage debt acquisitions more than other households. From the end of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020, average non-mortgage debt decreased by 1.8% for households in the lowest income quintile, compared with a reduction of 1.0% for those in the highest income quintile. Younger households limit non-mortgage borrowing despite acquiring more consumer goods Households with a major income earner younger than 45 tended to reduce their credit card and non-mortgage loan balances in the first half of 2020 and limited their borrowing to purchase consumer goods in the third quarter as restrictions on retail operations eased. Although the value of consumer goods held by those younger than 35 increased by 4.9% in the third quarter, the highest growth of any age group, most of these purchases were financed through savings or debt consolidation rather than through additional borrowing; their non-mortgage debt grew by 2.3% in that same quarter. The total value of consumer goods held by those younger than 35 was up 4.7% as of the third quarter of 2020 compared with 2019, while non-mortgage debt remained unchanged over that period. Chart 7 Average non-mortgage debt by age group of household major income earner, quarterly and cumulative change up to third quarter 2020 Large shifts in debt-to-income ratios for lower-income and younger households The debt-to-income ratio fluctuated greatly throughout 2020, especially for lower-income earners and younger workers. Along with reductions in income attributable to the onset of the pandemic, households in the lowest income quintile increased their ratio from 289.5% at the end of 2019 to 301.8% by the first quarter of 2020. Their ratio dropped to 227.0% in the second quarter as governments introduced support measures for those who lost their jobs or had a reduction in work hours. As business shutdowns eased in the third quarter, the debt-to-income ratio for the lowest-income earners stabilized as they regained employment or increased their hours of work. In contrast with other households, the debt-to-income ratio for those in the second income quintile grew by 4.7 percentage points, reaching 182.2% in the third quarter, because of a combination of increased mortgage debt and reductions in government benefits that outweighed gains in employment income. While the debt-to-income ratio for younger and core-age workers benefited from the introduction of a range of government benefits in the second quarter of 2020 to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic, ratio reductions for those aged 55 and older were driven by a combination of reduced debt and moderate growth in disposable income. In contrast with other age groups, households with a major income earner younger than 35 increased their debt-to-income ratio in the latter half of 2020, rising from 186.7% in the second quarter to 191.8% in the third quarter. Similar to lower-income earners, the youngest households increased their debt-to-income ratio in the third quarter as increased mortgage acquisitions outweighed income gains. Despite recent increases in the debt-to-income ratio for lower-income and younger households, their ratios remained far below those that existed prior to the pandemic. As the economy continues to evolve in response to the challenges introduced by the pandemic, future DHEA releases will shed further light on the state of household economic well-being, including developments in the trends for income, consumption, saving and wealth. Table 1 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Table 2 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Table 3 Net worth, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Table 4 Net worth, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to third quarter 2020, Canada Note to readers Statistics Canada regularly publishes macroeconomic indicators on household disposable income, final consumption expenditure, net saving and wealth as part of the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (CSMA). These accounts are aligned with the most recent international standards and are compiled for all sectors of the economy, including households, non-profit institutions, governments and corporations, along with Canada's financial position vis-à-vis the rest of the world. While the CSMA provides high-quality information on the overall position of households relative to other economic sectors, the distributions of household economic accounts (DHEA) provide additional granularity to address questions such as vulnerabilities of specific groups and the resulting implications for economic well-being and financial stability, and are an important complement to standard quarterly outputs related to the economy. The sub-annual DHEA estimates released today provide experimental estimates of income, consumption, saving and wealth and their sub-components by various household distributions for the first three quarters of 2020. Annual estimates for 2019 have also been revised to include the latest CSMA benchmarks. As with all data, these experimental sub-annual DHEA estimates are not without their limitations. For the most part, these experimental data rely on the same concepts and methods as the annual DHEA. However, to produce the DHEA on a sub-annual basis, new data sources were used and assumptions were made. DHEA estimates for wages and salaries were derived using Statistics Canada's Social Policy Simulation Database and Model, which incorporates data from the Labour Force Survey for employment by industry and wage level. The distributions of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit were aligned with microdata from Employment and Social Development Canada. Aggregate data on DHEA liabilities were distributed to household groups using sub-aggregate data purchased from a consumer credit rating agency. Because of scarcity in available microdata sources, aggregate estimates of DHEA household final consumption expenditure and household assets were allocated according to the DHEA distributions for reference year 2019. In an effort to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic well-being of households in Canada, these experimental DHEA estimates hold constant the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 2019 when estimating changes in income, consumption, saving and wealth throughout the first three quarters of 2020. It is therefore assumed that all households remained in their same distributional category as they did in the 2019 DHEA (e.g., age group, equivalized disposable income quintile, household composition). By holding constant the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of 2019, it is possible to estimate changes in various household economic indicators without intersecting changes from households moving across distributional groups. This approach allows for a clearer identification of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on household distributions, as well as the associated impacts of economic restrictions and government support measures on household economic well-being. The DHEA estimates released today are benchmarked to the quarterly income and expenditure accounts and the national balance sheet accounts published in December 2020. All values are expressed in quarterly nominal unadjusted rates, unless otherwise specified.

Total investment in building construction reached $16.0 billion for the first time on record, up 2.8% from the previous month, based on continued strength in the residential sector, while non-residential construction remained flat for the fourth consecutive month. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction increased 3.0% to $12.6 billion in January. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Residential construction investment continues to rise Investment in residential construction rose 3.9% to $11.6 billion in January, following a record high in December 2020. Gains were reported in every province except Manitoba. Ontario was the largest contributor, accounting for over one-third of the growth. A fourth consecutive monthly increase was reported in single-unit construction investment, up 4.0%. With the exception of a large drop in April 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, this component has increased eight times in the last nine months. While Ontario remained as the provincial leader in this component, Nova Scotia and Quebec both reached record highs. Multi-unit construction investment increased 3.7% on sustained growth in new construction and renovations in large condominium apartment projects. Multi-unit construction investment has been rising in Ontario from May 2020 to January 2021, with the majority of the investment reported in the census metropolitan area of Toronto. Infographic 1 Investment in residential building construction, January 2021 Non-residential construction investment remains flat Non-residential construction investment held steady for the fourth consecutive month at $4.4 billion in January. Institutional construction investment rose 0.6%, up in seven provinces, led by Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. Renovations to a hospital in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the construction associated with the Nova Scotia Community College, contributed to the growth in these two provinces. Investment in commercial building construction edged up 0.2%. Increases in five provinces more than offset declines in the other provinces. Investment in Ontario rose for the third consecutive month, attributable to the construction of high-value office buildings in the cities of Toronto and Ottawa, Amazon's ongoing Project Python in Ottawa, as well as an indoor recreational building in Pickering as part of the planned Durham Live tourist district. Industrial construction investment dipped 0.4% to $804 million. This was the second consecutive monthly decline, with Alberta (-5.1%) and Manitoba (-2.9%) posting the largest decreases. Investment in this component fell to its lowest level since January 2018, excluding the low level reported in April 2020 related to COVID-19 shutdowns.

Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in non-residential building construction, January 2021 Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Deflated data and seasonally adjusted data are revised for the previous two months. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates in constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (Table 18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to the structure type ""single."" Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage. Effective November 23, 2018, Table 34-10-0175-01 contains data on both the residential and non-residential sectors. It replaced tables 34-10-0010-01, 34-10-0011-01 and 34-10-0012-01. Next release Data on investment in building construction for February will be released on April 9.

By the end of May, many businesses had begun to adapt to the new reality by shifting to teleworking, reducing business hours, laying off staff, applying for government funding or seeking rent relief. With the gradual easing of pandemic-related restrictions, the business climate began to improve. The subsequent months resulted in an improvement in economic activity; however, the resurgence of COVID-19 and a return to a partial shutdown in several provinces this winter meant that there remain challenges and uncertainty ahead for businesses. Real gross domestic product edged up 0.1% in December, the eighth consecutive monthly increase. Total economic activity in December was about 3% below the pre-pandemic level in February 2020. From mid-January to mid-February, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. The survey collects information on the expectations of businesses moving forward and the ongoing impact of the pandemic on businesses in Canada. Over the next three months (see note to readers), over two-fifths of businesses expected their profitability would decrease, close to one-third expected their sales would decrease, over one-tenth expected they would increase the prices they charge and nearly three-quarters expected their number of employees would remain the same. Compared with 2019, close to one-third of businesses saw a decline in revenue of 30% or more in 2020. Businesses are concerned with future survival and expect to face a variety of obstacles in the short term. Many businesses anticipate decline in profitability in the short term Over two-fifths (41.8%) of all businesses and almost three-fifths (56.4%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expected their profitability would decrease over the next three months. Conversely, 8.3% of businesses expected their profitability would increase, most notably in wholesale (13.3%) and retail (12.8%) trade. Close to one-third (30.6%) of businesses expected their sales would decrease over the next three months. Nearly half of the businesses in accommodation and food services (49.2%) expected sales to fall. Over one-tenth (14.0%) of businesses expected they would raise prices over the next three months, down from nearly one-fifth (18.1%) of businesses last cycle. Businesses in wholesale trade (27.5%), manufacturing (23.3%) and retail trade (21.2%) were the most likely to expect they would raise prices. Slightly more than seven-tenths (70.6%) of businesses expected their number of employees to remain the same over the next three months, down from nearly three-quarters (74.1%) of businesses last cycle. Conversely, 11.7% of businesses expected their number of employees would decrease, relatively unchanged from 10.4% the previous cycle. Close to one-third (29.6%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expected a reduction in their number of employees over the next three months, up from nearly one-quarter (22.5%) in the previous cycle. The vast majority of businesses in accommodation and food services and arts, entertainment and recreation experienced loss in revenue in 2020 The vast majority of businesses in accommodation and food services (86.4%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (78.3%) reported a decline in revenue in 2020 from a year earlier. Furthermore, approximately three-fifths of businesses in accommodation and food services (61.5%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (54.8%) had revenues fall 30% or more year over year. Three-fifths (60.5%) of all businesses reported that revenues were down in 2020 from a year earlier and nearly one-third (31.0%) reported that revenue fell by 30% or more. Businesses are concerned with their survival over the next year Over half (51.3%) of businesses did not know how long they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures before considering closure or bankruptcy, while one-tenth (10.3%) of businesses reported they could continue for less than 12 months. Nearly one-quarter of businesses in accommodation and food services (24.9%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (23.3%) reported they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before having to consider closure or bankruptcy. Nearly half (46.4%) of businesses did not know how long they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures before considering laying off staff, while over one-fifth (21.3%) reported they could continue for less than 12 months. Over one-tenth (12.3%) of businesses have plans to expand or restructure their business, or to acquire or invest in other businesses in the next year. Conversely, 3.2% of businesses have plans to transfer or sell their business within the next year and 2.4% have plans to close their business, similarly to last cycle. Businesses in manufacturing (6.6%) and accommodation and food services (6.0%) were most likely to have plans to sell over the next year. Businesses expect to face a variety of obstacles Approximately one-third of all businesses expected fluctuations in demand (31.4%) or insufficient demand (29.2%) to be obstacles for their business over the next three months, while around one-quarter expected rising cost of inputs (25.5%), maintaining sufficient cash flow or managing debt (24.2%), and recruiting and retaining skilled employees (24.1%) to be obstacles. During these uncertain times, businesses are faced with a variety of obstacles and future unknowns. Fluctuations in consumer demand was a common obstacle expected over the next three months among businesses in accommodation and food services (45.5%), retail trade (43.3%), wholesale trade (39.6%), manufacturing (35.2%), construction (31.9%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (30.1%). Apart from fluctuations in consumer demand, key obstacles expected by businesses vary by industry. Around two-fifths of businesses in wholesale trade (46.9%), manufacturing (44.2%), construction (42.2%) and retail trade (37.3%) expected supply chain challenges to be an obstacle over the next three months. A substantial proportion of businesses in accommodation and food services (50.5%), transportation and warehousing (37.2%), mining, quarrying, and oil and gas (36.0%), information and cultural industries (35.0%) and wholesale trade (34.9%) expected insufficient demand would be an obstacle. Over two-fifths (42.5%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expected maintaining sufficient cash flow or managing debt would be an obstacle. Over half of businesses in this sector stated they do not have the ability to take on more debt (52.7%). In light of continuous reopenings and shutdowns because of fluctuations in the number of COVID-19 cases during different waves, government regulations posed an expected obstacle for around two-fifths of businesses in arts, entertainment and recreation (43.6%) and accommodation and food services (38.1%). Businesses shift to increase online sales capabilities The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with temporary store closures and physical distancing measures, prompted many Canadian retailers to open or expand their e-commerce presence, quickly changing the retail landscape. Retail e-commerce rose from 3.5% of total retail sales in 2019 to 5.9% in 2020. In December alone, online sales were up by over two-thirds (+69.3%) year over year to $4.7 billion. Almost one-fifth (16.7%) of businesses had an online sales platform or had plans to implement one. Businesses in retail trade (39.5%), wholesale trade (30.9%) and finance and insurance (30.9%) were most likely to have an online sales platform or plans to implement one. One-tenth (10.0%) of businesses made half or more of their total sales online in 2020, up from 6.8% in 2019. The largest increase (+9.5%) was in finance and insurance, where the share of businesses with half or more of their total sales online almost doubled from 11.8% in 2019 to 21.3% in 2020. Table 1 Expected obstacles to businesses or organizations over the next three months, by selected industries, first quarter of 2021 Note to readers Data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions are now available. The tables provide data at the national, provincial and territorial level by industrial sector, by employment size, by type of business and by majority ownership. Data are also available for the 20 largest cities in Canada by request. Data in this release are from Statistics Canada's Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. Results from this survey are applicable to employer businesses in Canada. This survey is carried out on a quarterly basis to collect information from businesses in Canada more efficiently and rapidly compared with traditional survey methods. The most recent survey was conducted from January 11 to February 11, 2021, and respondents were asked what their expectations would be over the next three-month period. As a result, those three months could range from January 11 to May 11, 2021, depending on when the business responded. This survey collected data from businesses on the current economic situation and will be used to effectively assess their needs for the implementation of support measures both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistics Canada would like to thank Canadians who took the time to answer questions for this survey at this time and enable a more robust understanding of COVID-19's impact on Canadian businesses and the economy.

January rang in the new year with a record high total value of building permits issued, rising 8.2% to $9.9 billion and surpassing the previous record of $9.6 billion set in April 2019. These gains were driven primarily by the residential sector. Chart 1 Total value of building permits Chart 2 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Infographic 1 Building permits, January 2021 Residential sector surges to new heights The value of permits issued in the residential sector increased 10.6% to $7.1 billion in January—rising past the previous peak of $6.5 billion posted two months earlier. Provincial highs were reported in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Manitoba. The majority of the rise in the residential sector was attributable to single-family homes, which climbed 15.1% to a record $3.5 billion—the eighth increase in nine months. Continuing the upward trend observed since October, the value of single-family permits issued in Quebec soared, rising 40.3%. Much of the gain came from regions outside of census metropolitan areas (CMAs). Multi-family permits increased 6.5% to $3.5 billion, mainly driven by higher construction intentions in Ontario (+17.1%), where several permits in excess of $100 million were issued for condominium apartments in the CMA of Toronto. Conversely, the value of multi-family building permits in Quebec fell for a fifth consecutive month in January. Chart 3 Month-to-month change in the value of residential building permits Chart 4 Month-to-month change in the value of non-residential building permits Non-residential sector up modestly in January The total value of permits issued for non-residential buildings rose 2.6% to $2.8 billion in January after a 10.8% drop in December. Following three consecutive monthly declines, industrial permits bounced back to average 2020 levels, increasing 31.7% to $535 million in January. High-value permits for an Amazon warehouse in Lachine, Quebec, and for two Eglinton Crosstown light rail transit stations in Toronto helped reverse the downward trend. The value of commercial permits increased 3.3% to $1.5 billion. Six provinces posted increases in this component, led by Ontario (+14.7%) and Quebec (+20.4%). Within the institutional component, municipalities issued permits worth $781 million, 11.8% lower than December. Values in Newfoundland and Labrador returned to typical levels following a $170 million hospital renovation permit issued in Corner Brook the previous month, pushing the national total lower.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The Building Permits Survey covers over 2,400 municipalities, representing 95% of the Canadian population. The communities representing the other 5% of the population are very small, and their levels of building activity have little impact on the total for the entire population. Building permit data are used as a leading indicator of activity in the construction industry. The value of planned construction activities presented in this release excludes engineering projects (such as waterworks, sewers or culverts) and land. For the purposes of this release, the census metropolitan area of Ottawa–Gatineau (Ontario and Quebec) is divided into two areas: the Ottawa part and the Gatineau part. Unless otherwise specified, the highlights refer to seasonally adjusted current dollars and are ranked in terms of dollar change rather than percentage change. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous two months have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous three months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for February will be released on April 1.

Terms of trade 95.2 (2012=100) Fourth quarter 2020 Source(s): Table 36-10-0105-01. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, following record fluctuations in the previous two quarters. In 2020, real GDP shrank 5.4%, the steepest annual decline since quarterly data were first recorded in 1961. Final domestic demand rose 0.9% in the fourth quarter, but was down 4.5% for 2020 overall. Chart 1 Gross domestic product and final domestic demand Growth in real GDP was strengthened by a large change in business inventories, as well as increases in government final consumption expenditure, business investment in machinery and equipment, and housing investment. Housing investment increases coincided with low mortgage rates and rising demand for housing. The large inventory drawdowns that were a drag on third-quarter GDP growth were absent in the fourth quarter as inventories recorded a small accumulation. For non-farm business inventories, the sizeable shift was concentrated in the retail sector, with accumulation observed for motor vehicle, building supply and sporting goods retailers. Accumulation of cannabis stocks largely contributed to the increase in farm inventories. The economy-wide stock-to-sales ratio fell from 0.843 in the third quarter to 0.836 in the fourth quarter. Chart 2 Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product, fourth quarter of 2020 Housing investment continues to rise Housing investment increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter, after rising 30.7% in the third quarter. Chart 3 Housing investment The increases were broad-based: new construction grew 4.1%, renovations rose 4.8% and ownership transfer costs were up 4.1%. A substantial increase occurred in new construction of both single-family and multiple-unit dwellings, especially in Ontario and Alberta. The increase in ownership transfer costs was widespread, as home resale activity continued to rise across the country. Compared with 2019, housing investment was up 3.9% in 2020, while household residential mortgage debt expanded significantly over the same period. Business investment slackens Business investment in engineering structures rose 1.6% in the fourth quarter, but investment in non-residential buildings fell 10.9%. This reflected weak demand for office buildings and shopping malls as remote working and online shopping became more common. Increased investment in machinery and equipment (+7.0%) coincided with higher imports of industrial machinery and equipment. Nevertheless, investment in machinery and equipment was down 16.4% in 2020. Household spending edges down Household spending edged down 0.1% in the fourth quarter, after a 13.1% increase in the third quarter. Spending was down 6.1% in 2020, compared with 2019. Chart 4 Household final consumption: durable and semi-durable goods Outlays for durable goods declined 0.2%, after the record increase (+39.6%) in the third quarter, which followed drops in the second quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreases in purchases of new trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles (-3.5%), and new passenger cars (-6.4%) were partly offset by increased sales of used motor vehicles (+4.0%). This reflected consumers' tendency to opt for used goods at times of economic uncertainty. Excluding these purchases, outlays for durable goods rose 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Household spending on major appliances (+9.0%) and furniture (+2.4%) rose, coinciding with stronger housing investment. Overall, spending on durable goods was down 3.7% in 2020. Outlays for semi-durable goods fell 4.7% in the fourth quarter, after sharp fluctuations in the previous two quarters. Decline in clothing and footwear (-8.9%) was partly offset by increases in games, toys and hobbies (+0.7%), and equipment for sport, camping and open-air recreation (+6.9%). These movements reflected shifts in spending patterns in the wake of the pandemic. Spending on semi-durable goods was down 7.8% in 2020. Chart 5 Household final consumption: non-durable goods and services Outlays for non-durable goods rose 0.6%, after rising 4.2% in the third quarter. As consumers spent more time at home and less time travelling, expenditures on food (+3.1%), licensed cannabis (+17.0%) and pharmaceutical products (+7.1%) rose. Expenditures on fuels and lubricants (-5.4%) dropped, owing to reduced use because of new restrictions in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec in the fourth quarter. Overall, spending on non-durable goods was up 3.1% in 2020 compared with 2019. Growth in outlays on services slowed from 9.7% in the third quarter to 0.2% in the fourth. Increases in outpatient services (+6.7%), and insurance and financial services (+1.8%) were more than offset by lower spending on food, beverage and accommodation services (-11.1%), and personal grooming services (-7.5%), owing to closures and limited openings of bars, restaurants and salons. Overall, outlays for services were down 10.3% in 2020. Export and import volumes slow Growth in export volumes slowed from 14.7% in the third quarter to 1.2% in the fourth, reflecting reduced international demand, owing to slowdowns in the economies of major trading partners in the fourth quarter, notably the United States (+1.0%), the United Kingdom (+1.0%), the Netherlands (-0.1%), Germany (+0.1%) and Italy (-2.0%). Chart 6 Exports and imports Exports of energy products (+6.1%) and metal and non-metallic mineral products (+10.8%) increased. Growth in the latter stemmed mainly from unwrought gold, silver, and platinum group metals, and their alloys; this surge reflected exports of refined gold to the United Kingdom, related to the Brexit-induced period of economic uncertainty. Export volumes were down 9.8% in 2020, compared with the volumes in 2019. Import volumes rose 2.6% in the fourth quarter, following record fluctuations in the previous two quarters. Increases in imports of consumer goods (+5.5%), motor vehicles and parts (+5.3%), and industrial machinery and equipment (+8.3%) were partly offset by a decline in imports of metal and non-metallic mineral products (-10.7%). Overall, import volumes in 2020 were down 11.3%, compared with the volumes in 2019. Terms of trade improve The ratio of the price of exports to the price of imports—the terms of trade—rose 1.7%, primarily because of a 2.4% increase in prices of exported crude oil and crude bitumen in the fourth quarter. However, for 2020 overall, terms of trade declined by 3.4%, owing largely to a 38.6% drop in prices of exported crude oil and crude bitumen. Nominal gross domestic product rises The GDP implicit price index, which reflects the overall price of domestically produced goods and services, rose 1.1% in the fourth quarter. Consequently, growth in nominal GDP (+3.4%) was higher than that of real GDP. Compared with 2019, nominal GDP was down 4.6% in 2020. Map 1 Compensation of employees in 2020 compared with 2019 (index 2019=100) Compensation of employees rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter, following a 7.7% increase in the third. Despite this growth in the second half of 2020, compensation was 1.6% lower over the year compared with 2019. The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy represented 3.3% of total compensation of employees in the fourth quarter, down from 7.3% in the third. Declines varied by region and were particularly sharp in the two oil-rich provinces, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador, reflecting the impact of lower prices of crude oil and crude bitumen in 2020. Households end the year with third consecutive double-digit savings rate Household disposable income dropped 1.0% in the fourth quarter, mainly because of a 17.2% decline in other benefits received from governments, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. Despite this decline, disposable income was up 10.0% compared with 2019, the largest increase on record in nearly four decades, as governments took extraordinary economic support measures during the year. By the fourth quarter, the extent of this support had diminished considerably; nonetheless, government transfers still exceeded their pre-pandemic levels from the fourth quarter of 2019 by a sizeable margin (+33.2%). The continued rebound in compensation, albeit at a reduced pace, coupled with still-elevated government transfers and stagnant consumption, kept the savings rate in double-digit territory for the third consecutive quarter. Canadians recorded a similar amount of savings in 2020 as in the previous seven years combined. Some of this savings made its way into currency and deposits of Canadian households, with growth in this asset nearing $160.0 billion over the first three quarters of the year. The savings rate for the fourth quarter stood at 12.7%, while the savings rate for 2020 was 15.1%. Transfers from governments exceeded losses in wages and self-employment income, resulting in lower-income and younger households recording some of the largest increases in savings. Support program expenditures continue to fuel government borrowing Overall, government revenues were far outstripped by expenditures throughout 2020, with the fourth quarter showing a marked increase from the second-quarter peak in governments' net borrowing of $443.8 billion. Government revenue remained fairly flat over 2020, the notable exception being the second quarter, when a decline in tax revenue on both income and products reduced government coffers. By the fourth quarter, these components had regained lost ground, but annual government revenue was 3.9% lower than the preceding year.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Data on gross domestic product, income and expenditure are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Revisions Gross domestic product (GDP) data for the fourth quarter have been released along with revised data from the first to third quarter of 2020. These releases incorporate new and revised data, as well as updates on seasonal trends. Given the unprecedented economic situation in 2020, revisions for this period are expected to be higher than normal. Support measures by governments To alleviate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented a number of programs, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. For a comprehensive explanation of how government support measures were treated in the compilation of the estimates, see ""Recording COVID-19 measures in the national accounts"" and ""Recording new COVID measures in the national accounts."" Details of some of the more significant government measures can be found in the footnotes of tables 36-10-0103-01, 36-10-0112-01, 36-10-0115-01, 36-10-0118-01, and 36-10-0477-01. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Percentage change Percentage changes for expenditure-based statistics (such as household spending, investment, and exports) are calculated from volume measures that are adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-based statistics (such as compensation of employees and operating surplus) are calculated from nominal values; that is, they are not adjusted for price variations. Unless otherwise stated, growth rates represent the percentage change in the series from one quarter to the next; for instance, from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2020. Real-time tables Real-time tables 36-10-0430-01 and 36-10-0431-01 will be updated on March 8.

From September to December 2020, just over three-quarters of Canadians told us that they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine, with marked differences observed in willingness by age, province and population subgroup. These findings are presented in a new study released today called ""COVID-19 vaccine willingness among Canadian population groups,"" which is based on responses from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine rises, mental health declines in November 2020 Following a summer respite, COVID-19 cases began rising again in the fall during the second wave of the pandemic. Then in December came promising news about the development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines. Widespread acceptance of the vaccine is important to help control the spread of COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy is a complex issue defined by the World Health Organization as a ""delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services."" From November to mid-December, 80.4% of Canadians reported they were somewhat or very likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This represents an increase from September, when 75.5% of Canadians reported a willingness to receive the vaccine. Moreover, an increase was observed in the proportion of Canadians who said they took certain precautions during this time, with over four-fifths reporting that they avoided leaving the house for non-essential reasons from November to mid-December (80.8%), up from two-thirds in September (67.0%). Also during this time, over one-third of Canadians told us their mental health had worsened since before the pandemic (37.3%), up from 29.6% in September. Vaccine willingness was higher in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and British Columbia Willingness to get the vaccine was not uniform across the country. From September to mid-December, a higher proportion of residents of Prince Edward Island (89.1%), Nova Scotia (81.5%) and British Columbia (81.4%) reported a willingness to get the vaccine, compared with the Canadian average. The differences between Canada and all other provinces were not statistically significant. Willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine varies markedly for diverse groups of Canadians Statistics Canada has previously reported that, for a number of reasons, population groups designated as visible minorities are at an increased risk of contracting or dying from COVID-19. Many of these population groups have higher poverty rates, are overrepresented in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, or live in overcrowded housing conditions. Additionally some visible minority groups are overrepresented in employment sectors where there is a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, such as Black and Filipino employees in the health care and social assistance industry. Among groups designated as visible minorities, willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 56.6% among the Black population to 82.5% among the South Asian population. At the time of the survey last fall, landed immigrants and non-permanent residents (74.6%) were less likely than Canadian-born individuals (77.7%) to report that they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine. No statistically significant differences were observed between recent and established immigrants. 72% of Indigenous people reported a willingness to receive the vaccine Nearly three-quarters of First Nations people living off reserve (74.2%) and Inuit (72.5%E) living outside Inuit Nunangat told us they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine, compared with just over two-thirds of Métis (67.8%). By way of comparison, just over three-quarters of respondents who were non-Indigenous (77.1%) were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine. Recent crowdsourced data from Statistics Canada found that Indigenous participants have also been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, especially with regard to their mental health and socioeconomic conditions. LGBTQ2+ Canadians are more likely to get the vaccine than non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians Based on multiple socioeconomic factors, including their higher representation in low-income groups and housing insecurity, LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 than other Canadians. Among LGBTQ2+ Canadians aged 15 and older, 83.3% reported last fall that they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine, compared with 76.8% of non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians. Older Canadians are more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine Seniors are the group most vulnerable to experiencing more severe outcomes of COVID-19, which is why they have higher priority for getting the vaccine. Perhaps it is not surprising then that last fall, more than four-fifths of Canadians aged 65 and older (82.5%) living in households said that they were somewhat or very willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, compared with three-quarters of Canadians aged 12 to 64 (75.5%). Black respondents aged 65 and older (78.1%) were much more likely than those aged 12 to 64 (54.9%) to say they were somewhat or very willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. There were no statistical differences in vaccine willingness by age group among LGBTQ2+ Canadians and Indigenous peoples. Note to readers The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is an annual survey that was adjusted during the pandemic to produce more timely estimates related to COVID-19. This analysis is based on CCHS data collected from September to mid-December 2020. The sample of more than 20,000 is representative of the Canadian population 12 years and older living in the provinces. Sampling and collection for the time period used in this analysis do not have adequate coverage to represent the entire population of the territories. Respondents were included in the analysis of the Indigenous population based on their self-reported answer to ""Are you an Aboriginal person, that is, First Nations, Métis or Inuk (Inuit)? First Nations includes Status and Non-Status Indians."" The CCHS does not collect data on reserves. Consequently, the results presented for First Nations people exclude those living on reserves, as well as Indigenous people in the territories or in remote northern regions of the provinces that include Inuit Nunangat. LGBTQ2+ Canadians include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or two-Spirit or persons reporting another non-binary gender or minority sexual identity. While members of these communities differ in the types of challenges and discrimination that they face depending on where they fall on the spectrum of sexual orientation and gender, this article groups them together due to the small sample size. Respondents were included in the LGBTQ2+ population based on self-reported sexual orientation, sex at birth and gender identity (transgender, including respondents with non-binary identities like genderqueer, gender fluid or agender). At this time, the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved in Canada have not been tested on children and are only available to those aged 16 and older. The CCHS includes respondents aged 12 and older, and the analysis in this article includes the entire population, since information on the willingness of Canadians aged 12 to 16 will be valuable once the vaccine becomes available for this age group. For more information on survey definitions and methods, refer to the Statistics Canada survey page: Canadian Community Health Survey. The symbol E next to an estimate indicates that the coefficient of variation for this estimate is between 15.1% and 35.0% and the quality is marginal. Users should interpret these results with caution. Products To help identify trends in COVID-19 indicators by age group and gender and by province and region, the interactive visual tool ""Canadians' Health and COVID-19: Interactive Dashboard"" has been updated with November estimates.

Health Canada is responsible for approving new vaccines after clinical research results confirm their effectiveness. Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is voluntary. As such, vaccine hesitancy could pose a threat to the success of a vaccination program (Dubé et al., 2013). Vaccine hesitancy is a complex issue defined by the World Health Organization as a delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services. Results from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) for the period of September 1 to December 12, 2020 show that 76.9% of Canadians (excluding residents of the territories) aged 12 and older reported being somewhat or very willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple reasons exist for why some Canadians are feeling hesitant towards receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. From the Canadian Perspective Survey Series 3, collected in June 2020, the most common reasons were lack of confidence in the safety of the vaccine (54.2%) and concerns about its risks and side effects (51.7%) (Frank and Arim 2020). These sources of concerns may have changed since vaccine testing and approval stages, which demonstrated their safety and effectiveness for authorized groups (Government of Canada, 2021). Although more than three-quarters of Canadians have indicated a willingness to receive the vaccine, there was some variation by province. Compared to the Canadian average, a higher proportion of residents living in Prince Edward Island (89.1%), Nova Scotia (81.5%) and British Columbia (81.4%) reported willingness. The differences between Canada and all other provinces were not statistically significant. Every individual has different lived experiences and beliefs, and this may influence vaccine hesitancy in different populations. This article focuses on vaccine willingness among certain populations that may have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding differences in vaccine willingness between populations can also help inform decision making, and public health messaging related to vaccines. Groups designated as visible minorities are at an increased risk of infection and mortality from COVID-19 (Subedi et al. 2020). One of the factors contributing to increased risk is over-representation in employment sectors where there is a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, such as the over representation of Black and Filipino employees in the health care and social assistance industry (Turcotte and Savage, 2020). The National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI) has placed employees who work in sectors with greater risk of exposure in a higher priority group for receiving the COVID-19 vaccines (NACI, 2020). Among people designated as a visible minority, 74.8% reported being very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Some differences exist for willingness among particular visible minority groups. Compared to non-visible minorities (77.6%), a much lower proportion of the Black population (56.6%) reported being somewhat or very willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (Table 1). A lower rate of vaccine willingness was also seen among the Latin American population (66.0%). Conversely, a higher proportion of the South Asian population (82.5%) reported a willingness to receive the vaccine. Immigrants also have a disproportionately high representation in employment sectors with greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 (Statistics Canada, 2020). From September to December 2020, 74.6% of landed immigrants and non-permanent residents reported a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, a lower rate compared to the Canadian-born population (77.7%). There were no statistically significant differences between recent (less than 10 years living in Canada) and established immigrants (living in Canada for 10 years or more; data not shown; excluding non-permanent residents). Previous crowdsource collected data from Statistics Canada have indicated that Indigenous participants have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, with greater impacts to their mental health and socio-economic conditions (Arriagada et al., 2020a, 2020b). Compared to the non-Indigenous population, a lower proportion of Métis (67.8%) reported a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The differences between non-Indigenous (77.1%) and First Nations people living off reserve (74.2%), or Inuit (72.5%E) living outside of Inuit Nunangat, were not statistically significant. Based on multiple socio-economic factors, including over representation in low income categories and higher incidence rates of housing insecurity, LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 (Prokopenko and Kevins, 2020). A higher proportion of LGBTQ2+ Canadians (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or Two-Spirit or persons reporting another non-binary gender or minority sexual identity) aged 15 and older reported a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Among LGBTQ2+ Canadians, 83.3% were somewhat or very willing to receive the vaccine, compared to 76.8% of non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians. ﻿ Table 1 Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, by population groups, Canada excluding the territories Table summary This table displays the results of Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 Vaccine and 95% confidence intervals, calculated using percentage units of measure (appearing as column headers).

Older adults are at a higher risk of experiencing more severe outcomes from COVID-19, and are positioned in a higher priority group to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. When looking at the previously discussed populations by age group, the proportion of willingness was higher for those aged 65 and older for both Immigrants and the Black population, compared to their counterparts aged 12 to 64 (Table 2). For LGBTQ2+ and Indigenous people, there were no statistically significant differences in vaccine willingness by age group. Looking at vaccine willingness by gender, no statistically significant differences were observed in vaccine willingness by males and females for Indigenous people, LGBTQ2+ Canadians, immigrants, and people designated as a visible minority. ﻿ Table 2 Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, by population and age groups, Canada excluding the territories Table summary This table displays the results of Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Total (aged 12 and older), Aged 12 to 64 (reference category) and Aged 65 and older, calculated using percentage units of measure (appearing as column headers).

Return to note 3 referrer Source: Canadian Community Health Survey (September to December 2020). Methodology The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is an annual survey that was adjusted during the pandemic to produce more frequent estimates on COVID-19 topics. This analysis is based on CCHS data collected from September to mid-December 2020. The sample of more than 20,000 is representative of the Canadian population aged 12 years and older living in the provinces. Sampling and collection for the time period used in this analysis does not have adequate coverage to represent the entire population of the territories. Respondents were included in the analysis for Indigenous peoples on the basis of their self-reported answer to “Are you an Aboriginal person, that is, First Nations, Métis or Inuk (Inuit)? First Nations includes Status and Non-Status Indians.” The CCHS does not collect data on reserves. Consequently, the results discussed for First Nations people exclude those living on reserves, as well as Indigenous peoples in the Territories or remote northern regions of the provinces which includes Inuit Nunangat. The sample size for Indigenous peoples was around 800 people. Currently the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved in Canada are only available to those aged 16 and older. The Canadian Community Health Survey includes respondents aged 12 and older, and the analysis in this article includes the entire population as the willingness of Canadians aged 12 to 16 will be valuable when the vaccine becomes available for this age group. All reported differences are statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.05. Bootstrap weights were used for significance tests. The term “visible minority” refers to Canadians designated as visible minorities as per the definition in the Employment Equity Act. The act defines minorities as “persons other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.” Visible minority groups include: South Asian; Chinese; Black; Filipino; Latin American; Arab; Southeast Asian; west Asian; Korean and Japanese. The term 'LGBTQ2+’ refers to persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, or persons reporting another non-binary gender or minority sexual identity. While members of these communities differ in the types of challenges and discrimination that they face depending on where they fall on the spectrums of sexual orientation and gender, this article groups them together due to small sample size. Respondents were included in the LGBTQ2+ population on the basis of self-reported sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another minority sexual identity such as asexual, pansexual or queer), sex at birth and gender identity (transgender, including respondents with non-binary identities like genderqueer, gender fluid or agender).

January Employment Insurance (EI) statistics reflect labour market conditions as of the week of January 10 to 16. During the reference week, public health measures already implemented for many regions of southern Ontario—including the closure of non-essential retail businesses—that were extended to the rest of the province effective December 26 were still in place. Existing public health measures also continued in Alberta and Manitoba, including the closure of in-person dining services, recreation facilities and personal care services, as well as restrictions on retail businesses. In Quebec, non-essential retail businesses were closed effective December 25, and a curfew implemented on January 14 further affected the operating hours of some businesses. Public health measures were eased between the EI statistics reference weeks in December and January in two provinces. In Prince Edward Island, restrictions that led to the closure of in-person dining and recreation and cultural facilities were lifted on December 18. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the surrounding area, restrictions on in-person dining were eased on January 4. Number of regular EI beneficiaries up sharply in January The number of Canadians receiving regular EI benefits rose 11.2% (+149,000) to 1.5 million in January. Results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicate that 1.9 million people were unemployed in January, including 1.5 million who were looking for work and 400,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Number of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries up sharply in January Proportion of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under new rules up in most provinces In September, temporary changes to the EI program, including a reduction in the number of required insured hours, were introduced to increase EI eligibility. In January, the proportion of EI recipients qualifying for EI under these new eligibility rules continued to grow in most provinces, with Newfoundland and Labrador (+2.3 percentage points) and Nova Scotia (+0.7 percentage points) posting the largest increases (not seasonally adjusted). Quebec was the only province to show a decline (-0.6 percentage points). Newfoundland and Labrador (16.8%) and Quebec (15.5%) had the highest proportions of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying for EI under the new rules, while Alberta (9.9%) had the lowest. Chart 1 Proportion of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules up in most provinces (not seasonally adjusted) Increase in number of regular EI beneficiaries concentrated in Ontario and Quebec In January, the increase in the number of regular EI beneficiaries was concentrated in Ontario (+82,000; +17.2%) and Quebec (+75,000; +25.0%), reflecting employment losses associated with public health measures implemented in both provinces at the end of December. The number of regular EI beneficiaries fell in British Columbia (-10,000; -6.7%), Nova Scotia (-3,000; -6.4%), New Brunswick (-1,000; -2.3%) and Saskatchewan (-600; -1.6%). The majority of the January increase in the number of regular EI beneficiaries occurred in census metropolitan areas (CMAs) (+108,000; +11.6%), particularly CMAs in Quebec (+59,000; +28.4%) and Ontario (+57,000; +14.0%). In January, the three largest CMAs—Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver—accounted for over one-third (36.0%) of total regular EI recipients, up from 21.5% a year earlier. Public health measures impact retail trade and accommodation and food services The number of regular EI recipients was up in all industries compared with 12 months earlier, with accommodation and food services (+251,000; +728.5%) and retail trade (+177,000; +438.8%) posting the largest increases (not seasonally adjusted). Illustrating the impact of ongoing public health measures, accommodation and food services (16.7%) continued to have the highest proportion of total regular EI recipients (not seasonally adjusted). According to January LFS data, employment in this industry was almost one-third (-31.4%) below its pre-pandemic February level, making this industry the one furthest from full recovery among all industries. Proportion of youth EI recipients on the rise Youth aged 15 to 24 accounted for 15.0% of total regular EI recipients in January, up from 9.1% one year earlier. The increase in proportion among young women (+4.1 percentage points) was more than double that among young men (+1.8 percentage points). January LFS results indicate that young women remained further from pre-pandemic employment levels than all other demographic groups. The number of core-aged (25 to 54 years) men receiving regular EI benefits rose by 46,000 (+11.2%) in January, while the increase among core-aged women was 33,000 (+8.3%). Combined, men and women who last worked in retail trade accounted for almost one-quarter (23.5%) of the monthly increase in regular EI recipients (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Proportion of youth regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries on the rise Looking ahead According to the January LFS results, 26.9% of all unemployed people in January had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more, an indication that many workers continued to face challenges resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market. This finding is reinforced by EI data, which show that 58.7% of regular EI recipients in January had received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for at least 7 of the 12 months before the survey, up from 15.6% one year earlier (not seasonally adjusted). Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit). Concepts and methodology The analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March 2020 to January 2021 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The number of regular EI beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from January 10 to 16. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals who qualified for EI only as a result of these program changes. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. EI beneficiaries by number of months on EI or Canada Emergency Response Benefit over the last year This supplementary indicator presents the number of regular EI recipients who received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for a defined number of total months over the last 12 months. A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – Definitions for more information. Data availability Data tables 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337 remain suspended as of the December 2019 reference period, because of occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is ongoing to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. Data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008 remain suspended as of the March 2020 reference period, because a source data file contains records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. In the data table 14-10-0009, for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed because of data quality. Next release Data on EI for February 2021 will be released on April 22, 2021.

Entire sectors of the economy have been subject to temporary restrictions on business activities as a result of public health measures aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19. At the same time, many workers have seen changes in working conditions, such as teleworking, reduced work hours and greater job insecurity. From mid-February to mid-March 2020, the 2020 Survey on Quality of Employment (SQE) collected information on aspects of job quality in Canada from the perspective of workers. Estimates reflect employment characteristics before the full onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and contribute to establishing a baseline for future analysis of quality of employment in Canada. Unless otherwise stated, the analysis focuses on the 23.5 million workers who were employed in February or March 2020 or who had last worked in 2018 or after, and excludes unpaid family workers. About half of workers in Canada had access to paid sick leave in their jobs prior to the pandemic As Canada entered the pandemic in March 2020, just over half (52.1%) of people who worked in the previous two years had access to paid sick leave in their current or last job. Just under 7 in 10 permanent employees had access to paid sick leave (66.3%). Among temporary employees, 4 in 10 employees with a contract of a fixed duration (41.0%) had access to paid sick leave, compared with 1 in 10 (12.6%) among other temporary employees, including on-call, seasonal, and casual workers. Few self-employed Canadians (6.2%) had access to paid sick leave through their job, particularly self-employed workers without employees (1.1%). Chart 1 Just over half of workers had access to paid sick leave prior to the pandemic Most workers with an irregular schedule would have preferred regular hours In February and March 2020, about 2 in 10 workers (22.6%), including unpaid family workers, had an irregular work schedule in their current or last job. For most (62.3%), this involved variation in both the schedule and the number of hours worked. Among people with an irregular schedule, 6 in 10 would have preferred a regular schedule (58.4%) and 2 in 10 worked less than they would have liked (22.0%). Workers with a regular schedule were generally more satisfied with their work hours; less than 1 in 10 worked less than they would have liked (8.8%). As a result of the pandemic, more Canadians have faced greater uncertainty in their hours. In February 2021, according to data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), 1.2 million workers had a job, but worked less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19. Autonomy and control was the main reason for self-employment Data from the LFS indicate that the recovery in self-employment has slowed in recent months, with employment levels further behind pre-COVID levels than among paid employees. There are a number of reasons why Canadians become self-employed. According to the SQE, in February and March 2020, 4 in 10 self-employed workers (40.4%) reported that the main reason why they were working or had recently worked in this capacity was to have autonomy and control over their work hours, wage rate and other aspects of work. Other common reasons include being passionate about the work (17.9%) and working in their field of expertise (17.2%). In contrast, less than 1 in 20 (4.1%) self-employed workers were unable to find work as an employee.

The SQE was conducted as part of Statistics Canada's RapidStats Program and was funded by Employment and Social Development Canada. Data were collected in the provinces in February and March 2020. The approximated response rate for in-scope persons for the SQE is 37.2%. After applying survey sampling weights, the survey is representative of non-institutionalized persons 15 years of age or older who have worked in a job or business in the past two years, who lived in one of Canada's 10 provinces, and who were not living in a collective dwelling or on a reserve.

Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—also posted their second consecutive decline, falling 1.4% in January because of lower sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores, furniture and home furnishings stores, and sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores. In terms of volume, retail sales fell 1.6% in January. With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Canada, provincial governments began to reintroduce physical distancing measures, which directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, approximately 14% of retailers were closed at some point in January for an average of three business days. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales increased by 4.0% in February. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 58% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 86.5%. Chart 1 Retail sales decrease in January Core retail sales decline because of lower activity at non-essential retailers Core retail sales fell for the second month in a row, down 1.4% in January because of lower sales at non-essential retailers, which were mandated to close their brick and mortar stores to in-person shopping in many regions across the country. Clothing and clothing accessories stores (-17.8%) led the decline, down for a fourth consecutive month. Furniture and home furnishings stores (-15.1%) posted declines in January after decreasing by 7.1% in December. Sales were also down at sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (-16.8%). Sales at food and beverage stores were flat in January (+0.1%), driven by lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores (-1.9%). The decline in supermarkets and other grocery stores followed gains in November and December, when more Canadians hosted their own holiday dinners following pandemic-related restrictions on gatherings. Sales at general merchandise stores—many of which are considered essential—increased by 3.3% in January after falling in December. Building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers also posted gains (+2.9%) in January, following a decrease in December. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers decline for a third straight month, while gasoline stations record another gain Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers contracted by 1.0% in January—their third consecutive decline. The decrease was mostly due to lower sales at other motor vehicle dealers (-13.5%) and used car dealers (-6.5%). By contrast, new car dealers (+1.2%) posted their first gain in four months. Sales at gasoline stations increased for the second month in a row, rising 0.9% in January. Growth was largely the result of higher gasoline prices, which were up on a month-over-month basis. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations were down 1.2%. Chart 2 Sales down in 6 of 11 subsectors Sales down in two provinces Sales declined in two provinces in January: Quebec and Ontario. In Quebec, sales posted their largest decrease since April 2020, down 9.8% in January. Stricter lockdown measures, including new restrictions on non-essential retailers and non-essential goods, were implemented in January. The introduction of a curfew also reduced operating hours for some essential retailers. Motor vehicle and parts dealers in the province reported lower sales, as lockdown measures limited in-person sales of new cars, while repairs and maintenance were still permitted. General merchandise stores, which were considered essential, also posted lower sales, as they were prohibited from selling non-essential goods. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montréal, sales were down 11.8%. In Ontario, sales decreased by 2.6% on lower activity at clothing and clothing accessories stores. Much of the province was under lockdown restrictions in January, which included the closure of non-essential retailers to in-person shopping, while physical distancing measures were in place at essential retailers. In the CMA of Toronto, sales were down 0.2%. Retail e-commerce in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 110.7% year over year to $3.5 billion in January, accounting for 7.8% of total retail trade. The continued rise in e-commerce sales coincided with an increase in store closures in January. On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce rose 15.0% in January. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are the exact same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally-adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally-adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. For information regarding cannabis statistics, consult the Cannabis Stats Hub. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form as there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they too are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

This was the sector's seventh consecutive year-over-year increase. Higher sales were reported in 13 of the 19 commodity categories. Looking ahead to January, the advance estimate provided by the Monthly Retail Trade Survey suggests that unadjusted total retail sales decreased 2.9%. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. Holiday spending leads to gains for food and beverage retailers Canadian retailers saw their largest gains come from food sales (+14.3%), as many consumers prepared for the holiday season at home because of restrictions related to social gatherings and travel. All product categories recorded higher sales, led by packaged food and dry goods not elsewhere classified (+17.7%), as demand remained high for chocolate and other baking supplies related to the Christmas season. Strong sales were also seen for fresh fruit and vegetables (+16.8%) and fresh meat and poultry (+16.3%) as more Canadians prepared holiday dinners as a result of the pandemic. Soft drinks and alcoholic beverages posted a 9.1% increase, due largely to sales of alcoholic beverages (+8.5%), which represented 75.3% of the gain in beverages in December. Automotive sales rise Motor vehicle sales rose for the fifth consecutive month, rising 3.3% compared with the same month a year before. Gains within the category were attributable to the sale of used motor vehicles (+10.7%), which posted its seventh consecutive year-over-year increase. Sales of new motor vehicles decreased 0.5%, as consumer preferences continued to shift away from new passenger vehicles (-13.1%) and toward new minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks (+3.1%). With many consumers looking for outdoor activities, sales of recreational vehicles (+67.7%) recorded their seventh consecutive monthly increase on a year-over-year basis. Gains were primarily driven by higher sales of new recreational vehicles (+72.9%), in particular new snowmobiles and personal off-road vehicles (+78.5%). Sales of automotive fuels continued to stagnate in December, down 21.4% from the same month the previous year. This was the eighth consecutive month during which automotive fuels posted the largest decline in the sector, as lower demand and prices (-21.3%) continued to restrict sales. Home for the Holidays Despite limitations by certain provinces on social gatherings during the holiday season, consumers continued to spend on Christmas-related decorations, with sales of decorative home furnishings up 9.0%. Santa Claus still visited many young children, as sales of toys and games increased 12.3%. Higher sales were also seen for live plants, seeds and other home and garden supplies (+39.8%), in part as a result of higher sales of real Christmas trees. Products associated with home improvement projects continued to be in demand, with renovation materials and supplies (+28.1%), major home appliances (+47.5%) and hardware and tools (+31.6%) posting strong sales increases compared with the same month a year before. Table 1 Sales by type of commodity, all retail stores – Seasonally unadjusted Note to readers The Retail Commodity Survey collects national-level retail sales data by commodity, from the same businesses surveyed in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey. No data have been seasonally adjusted. All percentage changes are year over year. New retail commodity data for e-commerce now available! Estimates from the Retail Commodity Survey are now available for the electronic shopping and mail-order houses industry (North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] code 454110). E-commerce figures of brick-and-mortar retailers are included with the commodity sales of the retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they are classified to NAICS code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose at a faster pace in January (+1.0%) year over year than in December (+0.7%). The acceleration in consumer prices was largely due to higher prices for durable goods (+1.7%) and rising gasoline prices (+6.1%) compared with December 2020. Excluding gasoline, the CPI grew 1.3% in January—up from a 1.0% increase in December. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.4% in January. Enhancements and Developments in the Consumer Price Index Program The Consumer Price Index (CPI) program evolves over time to incorporate innovations and adapt to changing circumstances.

Chart 1 The 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding gasoline Highlights The rise in consumer prices (+1.0%) occurred amid continuing economic uncertainty. Although consumer spending expectations are higher with the vaccine on the horizon, physical distancing measures were extended or reimposed in some regions to contain the spread of COVID-19, resulting in employment loss in close-contact sectors. Steadily increasing commodity prices since April also contributed to the overall rise in consumer prices in January. Chart 2 Prices for durable goods rise, while prices for semi-durable goods fall Gasoline prices rise for the second consecutive month Gasoline prices rose for the second consecutive month, up 6.1% in January compared with December. This increase coincided with production cutbacks by major oil-producing countries in response to low global demand for crude oil. Nevertheless, gasoline prices were 3.3% lower compared with January 2020, when heightened demand uncertainty first arose in the oil and gas market with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Chart 3 Monthly changes in gasoline prices New models push passenger vehicle prices higher Year over year, passenger vehicle prices rose at a faster pace in January (+2.9%) compared with December (+2.5%), mainly attributable to higher availability of new model-year vehicles compared with January 2020. Meat and fresh vegetable prices slow in January Meat prices grew at half the pace in January (+1.2%) year over year compared with December (+2.5%). This was partly due to much slower price growth year over year for fresh or frozen chicken in January (+0.2%) compared with December (+3.9%). Prices for fresh vegetables edged up 0.2% year over year, following a 1.1% increase in December. Slower vegetable price growth was attributable to abundant supply following a good harvest in the United States and Mexico, as well as the diversion of food destined for the food service sector towards grocers. Chart 4 Meat price growth slows Consumers pay more for phones and phone plans Prices for multipurpose digital devices, including smartphones, were 3.4% higher month over month in January—the highest monthly increase since September 2020. Prices for telephone services, which include landline and cellular services, rose 4.2% month over month in January, the first monthly increase since July 2020 (+0.2%). In January, prices for cellular services increased 5.5% month over month, following a 4.3% decline in December. Higher monthly prices for smartphones and service plans in January were largely a result of holiday promotions ending. Despite the monthly increases, prices for multipurpose digital devices (-19.9%) and cellular services (-9.4%) were lower year over year. Chart 5 Yearly changes in prices for multipurpose digital devices and cellular services Air transportation price index declines in January Airfares were down 5.5% year over year in January, the seventh consecutive monthly decline since July 2020. Lower prices coincided with ongoing advisories against non-essential travel. Chart 6 Yearly changes in air transportation prices Travel tours and COVID-19 In the wake of international travel advisories, travel tours remained unavailable to consumers in January. A general imputation strategy for services not available to consumers resulted in prices for travel tours being replaced with an imputed movement from the all-items CPI. This imputation effectively removed the impact of travel tours from the monthly CPI movement. At times, this approach has resulted in large year-over-year index movements because prices for travel tours often fluctuate significantly throughout the year, given the highly seasonal nature of travel services. In January 2020, the travel tours index fell 6.9% during a period of low seasonal demand for international travel. As a result of this decline falling out of the 12-month movement, which resulted in upward pressure on the index in January 2021, and the imputation treatment applied, the travel tours index was up 31.1% compared with January 2020. Given the treatment applied to this index, interpretation of the 12-month price change indicator for travel tours should be done with caution. Regional highlights Prices rose more year over year in January than in December in eight provinces, led by Newfoundland and Labrador (+1.5%). Prices rose at the slowest pace in Prince Edward Island (+0.5%), mostly attributable to lower heating fuel costs. Chart 7 The Consumer Price Index increases in eight provinces Electricity prices decrease in Ontario Electricity cost 4.4% less in January compared with the same month a year earlier. The decline was most pronounced in Ontario, where consumers paid 13.7% less, largely because the provincial government set all time-of-use electricity prices to the off-peak rate for 40 days, beginning on January 1, 2021.

To accurately reflect trends in the market, Statistics Canada periodically updates the methods applied to various components of the CPI. Enhancement: New approach to estimating the computer equipment, software and supplies index With the release of January 2021 CPI data on February 17, 2021, the computer equipment, software and supplies index was updated with an enhanced methodology and new data sources. This index represents 0.42% of the 2017 CPI basket and is part of the recreation, education and reading component. Detailed documentation is available in the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M) describing the new approach to estimating the computer equipment, software and supplies index. Upcoming enhancement: Resale housing data to be incorporated into the Mortgage Interest Cost Index Following the release of the Residential Property Price Index, the CPI will incorporate resale house prices into the house sub-index of the Mortgage Interest Cost Index (MICI). This enhancement will be published with the February 2021 CPI data (on March 17, 2021); it does not represent a change in methodology. More information on this enhancement will be included with the February 2021 release of the CPI. The MICI represents 3.57% of the 2017 CPI basket and is part of the shelter component of the CPI. More information on the MICI model can be found in Chapter 10 of The Canadian Consumer Price Index Reference Paper. COVID-19 and the Consumer Price Index Statistics Canada continues to monitor the impacts of the novel coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) on Canada's CPI. Goods and services in the CPI that were not available to consumers in January because of COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, effectively removing their impact on the monthly CPI. The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the all-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, personal care services in some areas, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. The price indexes for beer served in licensed establishments, wine served in licensed establishments and liquor served in licensed establishments were imputed in several regions, using the indexes to which consumers likely redirected their expenditures: beer purchased from stores, wine purchased from stores and liquor purchased from stores. Consistent with previous months affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for suspended flights are excluded from the January CPI calculation because passengers were ultimately unable to consume them. As a result, selected sub-components of the air transportation index were imputed from the parent index (air transportation). A document entitled Technical Supplement for the January 2021 Consumer Price Index is available in the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M) publication, with further details on the imputations used to compile the January 2021 CPI. Real-time data tables Real-time data table 18-10-0259-01 will be updated on March 1. For more information, consult the document Real-time CANSIM tables.

These measures severely impacted many businesses, particularly those in the food services and drinking places subsector which was one of the hardest hit by public safety measures. Since then, the industry has experienced constant challenges, exacerbated by the need to adapt in light of repeated re-openings and shutdowns as a result of fluctuations in the number of COVID-19 cases across the country. By May 2020, employment in the subsector dropped 55.8% (-635,515) from pre-pandemic levels observed in February 2020 and remained one-third lower (-29.3%; -336,667) in December 2020 compared with February 2020.Note As of December 2020, food services and drinking places accounted for 5.6% of all employer businesses in Canada.Note Real gross domestic product (GDP) of food services and drinking places fell 39.5% in March 2020 and by another 40.8% in April 2020Note as many of these businesses either closed completely or operated at a greatly reduced capacity, providing take-out or delivery services exclusively. In fact, more than half (56%) of food service and drinking place operators reported being closed at some point last April, while 41% reported being closed for the entire month.Note By the end of April 2020, sales in the food services and drinking places subsector fell 61.3% from pre-pandemic levels observed in February 2020. Sales grew steadily as restrictions were eased through the spring and summer before dropping 18.3% from September to December 2020, as the resurgence of COVID-19 prompted the re-implementation of restrictions in several provinces.Note By the end of 2020, the Canadian economy had endured nearly a full year of COVID-19 effects, and food services and drinking places were adapting to the new reality by operating at a greatly reduced capacity, shifting to take-out and delivery services, laying off staff, and applying for government funding among other things. From mid-January to mid-February 2021, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions to better understand the ongoing effects of the pandemic on businesses and business expectations moving forward. This article provides insights on those expectations, as well as on specific realities faced by food services and drinking places. Based on the results of this survey, the majority of food services and drinking places expect profitability to decline in the short term, are uncertain of how long they can continue operating before considering closure or bankruptcy, and are unable to take on more debt. A significant proportion of food services and drinking places experienced a decline of 40% or more in revenue in 2020 compared with 2019 and over three-quarters were approved for or received some form of funding because of the pandemic. Food services and drinking places adapt to repeated re-openings and shutdowns With restrictions placed on in-person dining coupled with a reluctance from consumers to dine-in, food services and drinking places have shifted to contactless delivery and take-out and made investments to expand their online sales capabilities. Over half (50.7%) of food services and drinking places reported they were likely or very likely to permanently adopt contactless delivery or pickup options. Over one-quarter (27.5%) of food services and drinking places have an online sales platform or plans to implement one. Notably, in 2020 nearly one-fifth (19.4%) of food services and drinking places made 30% or more of their total sales online, more than double the proportion that did in 2019 (9.1%). Furthermore, food services and drinking places have adjusted their business operations keeping in line with government regulations and recommendations. These businesses have increased expenditures on personal protective equipment and on implementing measures to keep customers and employees safe. Almost all (96.0%) food services and drinking places have increased expenditures on sanitization and cleaning and 87.8% have increased expenditures on personal protective equipment and supplies. Over 90% of food services and drinking places provide facemasks, gloves or other personal protective equipment to employees (93.0%), provide hand sanitizer to employees and customers (92.7%), and frequently clean high-touch areas or surfaces (91.2%). In addition, over 80% of food services and drinking places insist employees displaying any signs of illness stay home (84.6%) and restrict the number of people allowed into the space (80.9%).

Source: Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, first quarter of 2021 (Table 33-10-0315-01). Overwhelming majority of food services and drinking places reported lower revenue in 2020 compared with 2019 Over four-fifths (86.5%) of food services and drinking places experienced a decrease in revenue in 2020 compared to three-fifths (60.5%) of all businesses. A decline in revenue of 40% or more in 2020 was a reality for over two-fifths (42.9%) of food services and drinking places, with those in Quebec (50.9%), Manitoba (47.9%) and Ontario (44.9%) most likely to see this level of loss. Relatively few proportions of food services and drinking places had unchanged revenues (5.5%) or saw their revenues increase (6.7%) in 2020 compared with 2019. In contrast, just under one-fifth (19.2%) of all businesses experienced a decline in revenue of 40% or more in 2020, over one-fifth (20.7%) saw revenues unchanged and nearly one-fifth (18.1%) saw revenues increase.

Source: Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, first quarter of 2021 (Table 33-10-0317-01). Many food services and drinking places anticipate losses to continue into the near future Nearly three-fifths (56.6%) of food services and drinking places expected their profitability would decrease over the next three monthsNote compared with just over two-fifths (41.8%) of all businesses. Nearly one-third (29.8%) of food services and drinking places expected profitability to remain the same, while 8.5% expected their profitability to increase. Furthermore, approximately half (49.7%) of food services and drinking places expected lower sales over the three months that followed compared with nearly one-third (30.6%) of all businesses. Over one-third (35.3%) of food services and drinking places expected sales to stay about the same. The decline in travel and its impact on the tourism industry, Note combined with reluctance from consumers to dine indoors and changing government restrictions have increased uncertainty for food services and drinking places. Approximately half of Canadians reported that they expected to spend less on eating at a restaurant compared to prior to the pandemic, while 31% expected to spend less on ordering take-out food. Note Around half of food services and drinking places expected insufficient demand (51.7%) and fluctuations in demand (46.8%) to be obstacles for their business over the next three months. In addition, government regulations were an obstacle expected for nearly two-fifths (38.0%) of food services and drinking places and over one-fifth (21.7%) expected travel restrictions to be an obstacle over the following three months. Majority of food services and drinking places uncertain of business survival At their current level of revenue and expenditures, over half (51.2%) of food services and drinking places do not know how long they can continue to operate before considering closure or bankruptcy. Over one-quarter (26.2%) reported that they can continue to operate for less than 12 months before considering closure or bankruptcy, compared with one-tenth (10.3%) of all businesses. Nearly half (47.6%) of food services and drinking places do not know how long they can continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures before considering laying off staff, similar to the proportion of all businesses (46.4%). Nearly two-fifths (36.6%) of food services and drinking places can continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before considering laying off staff compared with just over one-fifth (21.3%) of all businesses. In the short term, nearly one-third (29.9%) of food services and drinking places expected their number of employees to decrease over the next three months, compared with just over one-fifth (20.3%) that reported the same last cycle.Note In contrast, over one-tenth (11.7%) of all businesses expected their number of employees to decrease over the next three months. Nearly three-fifths (57.5%) of food services and drinking places expected to have the same number of employees over the next three months, compared with 70.6% of all businesses. Majority of food services and drinking places cannot take on more debt Over half (54.0%) of food services and drinking places reported that they did not have the ability to take on more debt, up from less than half (46.1%) of food services and drinking places last cycle. Note Maintaining sufficient cash flow or managing debt was an obstacle expected over the following three months by over two-fifths (43.0%) of food services and drinking places, whereas just under one-quarter (24.2%) of all businesses expected the same. In response to the challenges experienced by businesses due the pandemic, various government programs focusing on funding or credit were made available to support businesses. Nearly all (92.1%) food services and drinking places were approved for or received some form of funding or credit because of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with under three-quarters (73.3%) of all businesses. The Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) provides eligible small businesses and non-profit organizations with a loan of up to $40,000 and is designed to help cover operating costs. The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) is a subsidy of 75% of employee wages for eligible businesses to re-hire staff they had laid off previously as a result of COVID-19 and prevent further job losses. The Temporary 10% Wage Subsidy for Employers is a three-month measure allowing eligible employers to reduce the amount of payroll deductions required to be remitted to the Canada Revenue Agency. Almost four-fifths (78.5%) of food services and drinking places were approved for or received the CEBA compared with over half (54.3%) of all businesses. Just over three-fifths (60.5%) of food services and drinking places were approved for or received the CEWS, compared with over one-third (34.6%) of all businesses. Under one-third of food services and drinking places (29.3%) were approved for or received the Temporary 10% Wage Subsidy for Employers compared with just over one-fifth (20.4%) of all businesses.

Source: Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, first quarter of 2021 (Table 33-10-0320-01). Methodology From January 11 to February 11, 2021, representatives from businesses across Canada were invited to take part in an online questionnaire about how COVID-19 is affecting their business and business expectations moving forward. The Canadian Survey on Business Conditions uses a stratified random sample of business establishments with employees classified by geography, industry sector, and size. An estimation of proportions is done using calibrated weights to calculate the population totals in the domains of interest. The total sample size for this iteration of the survey is 32,400 and results are based on responses from a total of 15,431 businesses, 795 of which were food services and drinking places.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose at a faster pace year over year in February (+1.1%) than in January (+1.0%). The rise in gasoline prices (+5.0%) supported consumer price growth in February. Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 1.0% in February—down from a 1.3% increase in January. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.1% in February. Explore the Consumer Price Index Check out the Personal Inflation Calculator! This interactive calculator allows you to enter dollar amounts in the common expense categories to produce a personalized inflation rate, which you can compare with the official measure of inflation that represents the average Canadian household—the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Visit the Consumer Price Index portal to find all CPI data, publications, interactive tools, and announcements highlighting new products and upcoming changes to the CPI in one convenient location. Check out the Consumer Price Index Data Visualization Tool to access current and historical CPI data in a customizable visual format. Chart 1 The 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding gasoline Highlights Prices for consumer goods (+1.0%) rose at a faster year-over-year pace in February compared with January (+0.1%), mostly because of higher gasoline prices. The price increase for services slowed year over year in February (+1.2%) compared with January (+1.9%). Lower clothing prices (-7.1%) largely contributed to the year-over-year price decline for semi-durable goods (-3.5%) in February. Chart 2 Prices for non-durable goods rise, while prices for semi-durable goods fall Gasoline prices rise in February Gasoline prices rose for the third consecutive month, up 6.5% in February compared with January (+6.1%), and this supported growth in consumer prices in February. The price increase comes amid a gradual recovery in global demand for gasoline, crude oil supply cuts in major oil-producing countries and weather-related shutdowns in the southern United States. On a year-over-year basis, gasoline prices were 5.0% higher, the first yearly price increase since February 2020. Chart 3 Yearly changes in gasoline prices Homeowners' replacement cost and mortgage interest cost indexes continue to move in opposite directions year over year The homeowners' replacement cost index, which is linked to the price of new homes, rose 7.0% year over year in February, as higher building costs, low interest rates and strong demand for homes with more space continued to push prices for new housing higher. This is the largest yearly gain recorded since February 2007. In contrast, the Mortgage Interest Cost Index fell 5.4% year over year in February, following a 4.3% decrease in January, as more Canadians renewed or initiated mortgages at historically low interest rates. Chart 4 Yearly price changes in mortgage interest cost and homeowners' replacement cost Prices for food purchased from stores and food purchased from restaurants Prices for food purchased from stores rose 1.3% year over year in February, compared with a 0.1% increase in January, primarily because of a rise in prices for fresh fruit (+5.9%). Prices for food purchased from restaurants were up 2.9% year over year in February, compared with growth of 2.8% in January. Higher prices for household appliances in February Household appliance prices rose 6.1% year over year in February, compared with January (+3.4%). Prices for cooking appliances (+6.8%) and refrigerators and freezers (+6.4%) were also higher, on a year-over-year basis, in February. Lower prices for traveller accommodation Year over year, traveller accommodation prices declined more in February (-18.0%) compared with January (-16.1%). Demand for traveller accommodation remained low amid continued restrictions on non-essential travel to contain the spread of COVID-19. Regional highlights Although price growth slowed in most provinces, prices rose more in February than in January in Quebec (+1.6%), Prince Edward Island (+1.4%) and New Brunswick (+0.8%). Prices increased at the slowest pace in Manitoba (+0.4%). Chart 5 Pace of Consumer Price Index growth accelerated in three provinces Rent prices in British Columbia lower year over year Nationally, rent prices edged up 0.1% on a year-over-year basis. In British Columbia, rent prices fell 2.9% in February compared with the same month a year earlier, the third consecutive monthly decline. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, lower demand, as a result of fewer students and lower migration to Vancouver, contributed to a higher vacancy rate in British Columbia's largest city.

Goods and services in the CPI that were not available to consumers in February because of COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, effectively removing their impact on the monthly CPI. The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the all-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, personal care services in some areas, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. The price indexes for beer served in licensed establishments, wine served in licensed establishments and liquor served in licensed establishments were imputed in several regions, using the indexes to which consumers likely redirected their expenditures: beer purchased from stores, wine purchased from stores and liquor purchased from stores. Consistent with previous months affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for suspended flights are excluded from the February CPI calculation because passengers were ultimately unable to consume them. As a result, selected sub-components of the air transportation index were imputed from the parent index (air transportation). Enhancement: Resale housing prices incorporated into the Mortgage Interest Cost Index With the release of the February 2021 CPI data on March 17, 2021, the Mortgage Interest Cost Index (MICI) has been enhanced by incorporating into the house sub-index the Resale Housing Price Index (a component of the Residential Property Price Index). The MICI represents 3.57% of the 2017 CPI basket and is part of the shelter component of the CPI. Detailed documentation is available in the ""Technical Supplement for the February 2021 Consumer Price Index,"" within the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M) publication. It provides further details on the imputations used to compile the February 2021 CPI and the incorporation of resale housing prices in the MICI. Real-time data tables Real-time data table 18-10-0259-01 will be updated on March 29. For more information, consult the document ""Real-time CANSIM tables."" Next release The Consumer Price Index for March will be released on April 21. The adjusted price index for December 2020, January 2021 and February 2021 will be released April 12.

Raw Materials Price Index, excluding crude energy products January 2021 3.2% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 18-10-0268-01. Prices for products manufactured in Canada, as measured by the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI), rose 2.0% in January, mainly as a result of higher prices for lumber and other wood products, as well as energy and petroleum products. Prices of raw materials purchased by manufacturers operating in Canada, as measured by the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI), were up 5.7%, driven mainly by higher prices for crude energy products. Chart 1 Prices for industrial products increase Industrial Product Price Index In January, the IPPI rose 2.0%, its strongest monthly increase since February 2015 (+2.0%). Of the 21 major product groups, 15 were up, 5 were down and 1 was unchanged. Prices for lumber and other wood products (+10.8%) were the biggest contributor to the IPPI's growth. Prices for softwood lumber increased 19.0% in January, following a strong gain of 20.5% in December. Compared with January 2020, softwood lumber prices surged 112.1%. Persistent demand for softwood lumber was a contributing factor in these increases. From December to January, the annualized number of housing starts in Canada rose 23.1% to 282,428 units. Energy and petroleum product prices (+7.9%)—posting its fourth consecutive monthly increase—also contributed greatly to the January growth in the IPPI, primarily as a result of higher prices for refined petroleum products (+8.2%). While prices for all refined petroleum products rose compared with December, motor gasoline (+10.4%) and diesel and biodiesel fuels (+4.6%) led the increase in this category. Prices for chemicals and chemical products increased 3.3%, primarily as a result of higher prices for petrochemicals (+10.2%), ammonia and chemical fertilizers (+14.5%), and plastic resins (+5.8%). Prices for primary non-ferrous metal products (+1.5%) and meat, fish and dairy products (+1.8%) also rose in January. The increase in prices for primary non-ferrous metal products was mostly driven by a 1.7% rise in prices for unwrought gold, silver and platinum group metals, and their alloys. According to the London Bullion Market Association, the average value of silver increased 3.4% in January to CAD $33.00 per ounce, while the value of gold remained relatively stable. Higher prices for fresh and frozen beef and veal (+5.5%) and—to a lesser extent—fresh and frozen poultry of all types (+2.7%), and fresh and frozen pork (+2.1%) were primarily responsible for the gain observed in meat, fish and dairy products. Year over year, the IPPI increased 4.0%. Higher prices for lumber and other wood products (+61.6%) and primary non-ferrous metal products (+23.4%) were the principal causes of this gain. Raw Materials Price Index The RMPI increased 5.7% in January, following growth of 3.5% in December. This was the fourth straight monthly increase and the strongest gain since August 2020 (+5.7%). All six major product groups were up in January. Crude energy product prices rose 11.4%, pulled upward mainly by higher prices for conventional crude oil (+11.5%), synthetic crude oil (+13.8%), and natural gas (+6.0%). However, compared with January 2020, crude energy prices fell 8.2%. Ongoing supply restrictions imposed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partner countries, along with an anticipated increase in oil demand, continued to exert upward pressure on crude oil prices in January. Crop products were up 9.1% in January, driven in large part by higher prices for canola (+15.9%), which have been trending upward since March 2020. This was also the largest monthly increase for canola since February 2008 (+16.1%). Among other crop products, prices for grains (except wheat) rose 7.0% and oilseed (except canola) prices increased 17.1%. Prices for metal ores, concentrates and scrap (+2.1%) and animals and animal products (+1.8%) also rose compared with December. Year over year, the RMPI was up 6.2%—its first increase since January 2020. This growth was led by higher prices for metal ores, concentrates and scrap (+25.8%). Chart 2 Prices for raw materials increase Table 1 Industrial Product Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Table 2 Raw Materials Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Note to readers The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) and the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) are available at the Canada level only. Selected commodity groups within the IPPI are also available by region. With each release, data for the previous six months may have been revised. The indexes are not seasonally adjusted. The Industrial Product Price Index reflects the prices that producers in Canada receive as goods leave the plant gate. The IPPI does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike the Consumer Price Index, the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and all costs that occur between the time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user takes possession of the good. This includes transportation, wholesale and retail costs. Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars, and these prices are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp and paper products, and wood products. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US counterpart affect the IPPI. However, the conversion to Canadian dollars reflects only how respondents provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes into account the full effect of exchange rates. The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on the average monthly exchange rate established by the Bank of Canada and available in Table 33-10-0163-01 (series v111666275). Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example, CAN$1 = US$X). The Raw Materials Price Index reflects the prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI. Basket update and methodology changes Starting with the October 2020 reference period, the IPPI and RMPI are using an updated basket and methodology. The indexes have been converted from 2010 = 100 to January 2020 = 100 and also updated to use a weighting pattern based on the 2016 production values of Canadian manufacturers. At the same time, the IPPI and RMPI have been modernized with the adoption of a weighted geometric (Jevons) formula and incorporation of parental imputation as the default imputation methodology for missing price quotes. The IPPI and RMPI are now using the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) Canada 2017 version 2.0 and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Canada 2017 version 3.0. Products Statistics Canada launched the Producer price indexes portal as part of a suite of portals for prices and price indexes. This web page provides Canadians with a single point of access to a variety of statistics and measures related to producer prices. The video ""Producer Price Indexes"" is available on the Statistics Canada Training Institute web page. It provides an introduction to Statistics Canada's producer price indexes—what they are, how they are made and what they are used for. Next release The industrial product and raw materials price indexes for February will be released on March 31.

At the beginning of 2021, 32% of Canadian employees aged 15 to 69 worked most of their hours from home, compared with 4% in 2016. As noted in the most recent release of the Labour Force Survey, 3.1 million Canadians were working from home temporarily in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as of February 2021. Since Canadian workers and their employers have now made intensive use of telework for several months, a few questions are worth investigating: to what degree are teleworkers more or less productive, what are the main barriers to productivity, and how many Canadians would prefer working from home once the COVID-19 pandemic is over? A new study released today sheds light on these questions, using supplementary questions added to the February 2021 Labour Force Survey. The focus is on new teleworkers, i.e., employees who usually worked outside the home before the COVID-19 pandemic but who worked most of their hours at home during the week of February 14 to 20, 2021. To ensure that these new teleworkers can provide a valid assessment of how productive they are now, at home, relative to their usual place of work, the analysis is restricted to those who have been with the same employer since at least March 2019, i.e., at least one year prior to the economic shutdown of mid-March 2020. The vast majority of new teleworkers report being at least as productive at home as they were at their usual place of work Of all new teleworkers, 90% reported being at least as productive, i.e., accomplishing at least as much work per hour, at home as they were previously at their usual place of work. More than half (58%) reported accomplishing about the same amount of work per hour, while roughly one-third (32%) reported accomplishing more work per hour. The remaining 10% mentioned that they accomplished less work per hour while working at home than they did previously at their usual place of work. The likelihood of accomplishing more work per hour varied across industries. For example, the percentage of new teleworkers who reported doing more work per hour was relatively high in public administration (41%) and health care and social assistance (45%). In contrast, the corresponding percentage amounted to 31% in goods-producing industries. Regardless of age, educational attainment, marital status, industry, occupation, and whether or not they have children, men and women tended to report to a similar extent being at least as productive at home as they were in the past at their usual place of work. These findings are in line with those of a recent U.S. study (Barrero, Bloom and Davis 2020), which shows that 85% of U.S. workers report being at least as efficient at home during the COVID-19 pandemic as they were on business premises before the pandemic. Whether the productivity assessments made by Canadian workers regarding telework match those of their employers is currently unknown. Almost half of new teleworkers who report accomplishing more work per hour also work longer hours per day While the vast majority of new teleworkers reported being at least as productive at home as they were in the past, several of them ended up working longer hours per day at home than they did at their usual place of work. Large proportions of individuals who accomplish more work per hour (48%) and of individuals who do less work per hour (44%) reported working longer hours per day than they did in the past. Furthermore, virtually none of the workers who accomplish at least as much work per hour at home as they did previously now work shorter hours per day. Overall, 35% of all new teleworkers reported working longer hours, with managers doing so in greater proportions (51%). In contrast, 3% of all new teleworkers reported working shorter hours. The degree to which these longer hours affect family–work balance and the extent to which they will persist once the COVID-19 pandemic is over remain to be seen. Preliminary evidence regarding barriers to productivity Employees who reported accomplishing less work per hour while working from home identified different barriers to productivity. About one in five of those who reported being less productive than prior to the pandemic reported a lack of interaction with co-workers as the main reason why they accomplished less work per hour. Close to 20% reported having to care for children or other family members. The remainder faced different challenges, such as accessing work-related information or devices (11%), having to do additional work to get things done (13%), having an inadequate physical work space (10%), or experiencing difficulty with Internet speed (5%). Since these numbers are based on a relatively small sample, they are best interpreted as providing preliminary—rather than definitive—evidence regarding the barriers to productivity faced by new teleworkers. Preferences for telework are diverse New teleworkers were also asked the degree to which they would prefer working from home or outside the home once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Their preferences for telework were diverse. Overall, 80% of new teleworkers indicated that they would like to work at least half of their hours from home once the pandemic is over. In fact, 41% indicated that they would prefer working about half of their hours at home and the other half outside the home, while 39% would prefer working most (24%) or all (15%) of their hours at home. The remaining 20% would prefer working most (11%) or all (9%) of their hours outside the home. Men and women mentioned that they would like to work at least half of their hours from home in fairly similar proportions. The diversity of preferences for telework observed in the aggregate was also found regardless of the socioeconomic group considered. For example, 43% of new teleworkers employed in large firms in the commercial sector—i.e., in sectors other than public administration, educational services, and health care and social assistance—indicated that they would like to work most or all of their hours at home once the pandemic is over. In addition, 40% would prefer working half of their hours from home and the other half elsewhere. The remaining 17% would prefer working most or all of their hours outside the home. Productivity at home is a strong predictor of preferences for telework Workers who reported accomplishing more work per hour while working from home indicated that they would prefer working most or all of their hours at home much more often (57%) than all other workers (30%). The large difference observed between these two groups remained in multivariate analyses, thereby confirming that productivity at home is a strong predictor of preferences for telework. Conversely, 54% of teachers expressed a preference for working most or all of their hours outside the home. This is three times the percentage observed for other workers (18%). In line with the notion that working longer hours might make telework less attractive, employees who reported working longer hours per day were, even after controlling for several personal and job characteristics, less likely than others to prefer working most or all of their hours at home.

A person may be more or less productive now that they are mainly working from home. Think about your average work day since you started mainly working from home, compared with the time when you mostly worked outside the home. Do you: Work longer hours Work shorter hours Work about the same number of hours Accomplish more work per hour Accomplish less work per hour Accomplish about the same amount of work per hour Q2. (Asked only for new teleworkers who report accomplishing less work per hour.) What is the main reason why you usually accomplish less work per hour when working from home? Would you say you: a) Experience difficulty with Internet speed b) Experience difficulty accessing work-related information or devices (e.g., accessing some documents, software, databases, videoconference platforms) c) Have to do additional work (administrative or other) to get things done d) Have to provide care for children or other household members during working hours (e.g., assisting with remote schooling, tending to young children, caring for elderly household members) e) Have an inadequate physical work space at home (e.g., no quiet room, inadequate office equipment) f) Lack interaction with co-workers g) Experience health issues related to lockdown (e.g., anxiety, depression, physical pain) h) Other i) Don't know Q3. Given the choice, what type of work arrangement would you prefer once the pandemic is over? Would you say you would prefer to work: All hours outside the home Most hours outside the home About half at home and half outside the home Most hours at home All hours at home Reference: Barrero, J.M., N.

Employment generated by tourism 511,400 Fourth quarter 2020 -0.4% (quarterly change) Source(s): Table 36-10-0232-01. Tourism spending in Canada declined 2.0% in the fourth quarter, closing an otherwise volatile year in the tourism sector. Tourism spending was almost cut in half (-48.1%) in 2020. Tourism gross domestic product (GDP) decreased 3.3% in the fourth quarter and was down 47.9% annually. Tourism was among the hardest hit sectors of the economy in 2020 as a result of physical distancing measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. Tourism spending in the first quarter was stunted by the declaration of a global pandemic in mid-March and the accompanying physical distancing measures to prevent its spread. The second quarter was almost entirely subject to these restrictions. Many restrictions were eased in the third quarter in conjunction with fewer COVID-19 cases, which provided more tourism spending opportunities. The fourth quarter saw increased restrictions in many provinces during the second wave of the pandemic, limiting the availability of services generally purchased by tourists. The decline in tourism spending in the fourth quarter was mostly driven by lower spending on food and beverage services (-11.6%), which coincided with tighter restrictions on indoor dining. Spending on vehicle fuel (-3.6%) also contributed to the decline. The drop was partially offset by a 23.6% increase in passenger air transport, which continued to recover from the 94.9% decline in the second quarter. Annually, passenger air transport was down by almost three-quarters (-72.4%), the largest contributor to the overall decline in tourism spending in 2020. Chart 1 Tourism spending declines Tourism GDP decreased 3.3%, reflecting the weaker spending on tourism components as the overall economy grew 2.3% in the fourth quarter. Annually, economy-wide GDP fell (-5.4%) at a much slower pace in 2020 than the tourism sector (-47.9%). This contributed to a decline in tourism's share of GDP, which fell from 2.0% in 2019 to 1.1% in 2020. Employment attributable to tourism edged down 0.4% in the fourth quarter, following a 27.5% increase in the third quarter. The decline was mostly due to fewer jobs in food and beverage services (-5.3%), which was partially offset by more jobs in accommodation (+5.1%). Tourism jobs fell 28.7% annually in 2020, with most of the drop occurring in the second quarter. All tourism categories were down in 2020, with food and beverage services (-32.3%) and accommodation (-35.2%) contributing most to the overall decline. Tourism's share of employment fell from 3.8% in 2019 to 3.0% in 2020. Chart 2 Tourism gross domestic product and jobs attributable to tourism decline Tourism spending in Canada by Canadians decreases Tourism spending in Canada by Canadians decreased 3.4% in the fourth quarter, led by lower spending on food and beverage services (-12.6%) and vehicle fuel (-3.9%). The quarterly decline was partially offset by higher spending on passenger air transport (+18.5%). Annually, domestic tourism spending declined 38.6% in 2020, but its share of total tourism spending rose from 78.4% in 2019 to 92.7% in the wake of the collapse of international visitors as a result of border closures to non-essential travel. Spending by international visitors remains low Tourism spending by international visitors to Canada rose 99.3% in the fourth quarter, following record low levels in the two previous quarters. Despite the increase, spending was well below pre-pandemic levels. Spending by international visitors declined 82.5% in 2020, with most of the spending occurring before the borders were closed in mid-March. As a result, the share of tourism exports to total tourism spending fell from 21.6% in 2019 to 7.3% in 2020. Chart 3 Tourism spending by international visitors remains low Table 1 National tourism indicators – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The national tourism indicators are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global goals for sustainable development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goal: Note to readers Growth rates for tourism spending and gross domestic product (GDP) are expressed in real terms (that is, adjusted for price changes), using reference year 2012, as well as adjusted for seasonal variations, unless otherwise indicated. Employment data are also seasonally adjusted. Tourism's share of economy-wide GDP is calculated from seasonally adjusted nominal values. Tourism's share of economy-wide employment is calculated using seasonally adjusted values. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Associated percentage changes are presented at quarterly rates unless otherwise noted. Economy-wide GDP is obtained from table 36-10-0104-01. Economy-wide employment is obtained from table 36-10-0207-01. With the fourth quarter release of the national tourism indicators, data for the first, second and third quarters have been revised. Revisions over this period are expected to be higher than normal due to the volatile economic situation, particularly for the tourism sector. The national tourism indicators are funded by Destination Canada. Next release Data on the national tourism indicators for the first quarter will be released on June 29.

January data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are now available. SEPH provides monthly information on payroll employment, earnings and hours worked in Canada, the provinces and the territories. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), data from the SEPH and JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions. The ongoing and additional public health measures put in place in many provinces in late December were maintained throughout the month of January. In Ontario, tighter restrictions already in place for most of the southern regions were extended to the rest of the province on Boxing Day. In Quebec, non-essential retail businesses were closed as of Christmas Day, while a curfew implemented on January 14 further affected the operating hours of some businesses. Public health measures affecting retail stores, in-person dining, recreation facilities and personal care services also remained in place in Alberta and Manitoba. Payroll employment falls in January Payroll employment fell by 134,500 (-0.8%) in January, following an increase of 48,000 (+0.3%) in December. The largest declines were in Ontario (-66,100; -1.1%) and Quebec (-43,700; -1.2%). Nationally, losses were driven by sectors affected by tightened public health measures, including retail trade, accommodation and food services, and arts, entertainment and recreation. January LFS results included a drop in employment of 213,000, driven by losses in the Quebec and Ontario retail trade sectors (not seasonally adjusted). The total number of payroll employees in January was 1.2 million (-7.0%) lower than in February 2020. Chart 1 Payroll employment declines in the first month of 2021 Average weekly earnings up in January Average weekly earnings were $1,135 in January, up 1.8% compared with December. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 8.3%, as job losses since February 2020 have been concentrated among hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees. In January, the number of hourly paid employees was 10.0% below its pre-COVID level, compared with a gap of 3.2% for salaried employees. Total hours worked decline and average weekly hours worked rise Total hours worked fell 0.5% in January and were 5.2% below their pre-COVID February level, compared with a gap of 16.5% in May. Average hours worked per week rose 0.6% (+0.2 hours) in January to 33.9 hours. In February 2020, payroll employees worked an average of 33.0 hours per week. Average hours worked can be influenced by a number of factors, such as compositional changes in employment by industry or changes in the typical work schedule. Employment falls in four sectors directly affected by tighter public health measures Payroll employment in retail trade fell by 65,900 (-3.4%) in January, notably in Ontario and Quebec where tighter public health measures were put in place in late December. While January LFS data reflected this decline in retail trade as well, data from the SEPH are particularly useful in shedding new light on employment by subsector. January SEPH results showed that declines were spread across most subsectors, led by clothing and clothing accessories stores (-34,500; -19.0%), the hardest hit subsector within retail trade since the start of the pandemic. In contrast, employment increased in food and beverage stores (+10,100; +1.9%) in January. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—fell for the second consecutive month (-1.4%) in January, because of lower sales at non-essential retailers. Year over year, average weekly earnings in the sector increased 4.0% to $650. Chart 2 Clothing and clothing accessories stores drive the January payroll employment decline in retail trade Payroll employment in accommodation and food services declined for the third consecutive month, down by 44,000 (-4.7%) in January, with full-service restaurants and limited-service eating places, traveller accommodation, and drinking places continuing a downward trend that started in autumn 2020. In January, most of the declines were in Ontario, Alberta and Quebec. Year over year, average weekly earnings in the sector increased 3.0% to $445. In arts, entertainment and recreation, employment fell by 29,500 (-13.6%) in January, with the largest decreases in other amusement and recreation industries—which include recreational, sports and fitness centres—and gambling industries. Compared with January 2020, average weekly earnings in the sector rose 17.9% to $742. According to data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, nearly one-quarter of businesses in accommodation and food services (24.9%), and arts, entertainment and recreation (23.3%) reported that they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before having to consider closure or bankruptcy, a larger proportion than the average across all businesses (10.1%). In the ""other services"" sector, employment decreased by 18,400 (-3.8%), mainly in the personal care services industry, including hair care and esthetic services. According to LFS data, about 9 in 10 employees in personal care services in 2020 were women. Payroll employment gains in construction led by Quebec and Ontario Payroll employment in construction rose by 24,800 (+2.4%) in January, driven by increases in Quebec (+14,700; +7.2%) and Ontario (+7,100; +2.0%). Employment gains in January were largest among specialty trade contractors (+17,300; +2.8%) and in construction of buildings (+8,900; +3.6%). Notable employment gains in residential building construction (+6,400; +4.5%) drove the increases in construction of buildings. Investment in residential construction rose 3.9% to a record $11.6 billion in January. Average weekly earnings in construction were $1,352 in January, little changed compared with 12 months earlier. Employment in professional, scientific and technical services surpasses pre-pandemic level in January Payroll employment increased in professional, scientific and technical services in January (+16,300; +1.7%), surpassing its pre-pandemic level for the first time. Employment in scientific research and development services was the furthest above its pre-pandemic level (+6.0%), followed by computer systems design and related services (+5.0%), while advertising, public relations, and related services was the furthest below its February level (-11.4%). Chart 3 Payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services surpasses its pre-pandemic level in January The recovery of payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services might be due to the fact that most jobs (84%) in this sector can potentially be performed from home, compared with an overall average of 39% across all sectors, according to a previous Statistics Canada release on working from home. Year over year, average weekly earnings in professional, scientific and technical services were up 3.0% to $1,512. Monthly results from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey In January, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 484,400 positions (not seasonally adjusted). The job vacancy rate, which represents vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied) was 3.0%, following vacancy rates between 3.0% and 3.9% from October to December 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). While monthly and quarterly job vacancy statistics are not directly comparable, the quarterly job vacancy rate was 3.1% in the first quarter of 2020. Health care and social assistance continues to have the most vacancies In January, health care and social assistance had more job vacancies (88,600) than any other sector for the third consecutive month, and had a job vacancy rate of 4.1% (not seasonally adjusted). Prior to the pandemic, the quarterly vacancy rate in this sector ranged from 3.0% to 3.3% from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Results from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions showed that 26.8% of businesses in health care and social assistance expect to face labour shortages in the first few months of 2021, higher than the average for all sectors (19.5%). Along with surpassing its pre-COVID level of payroll employment in January, professional, scientific and technical services also had the second-highest vacancy rate (4.5%) among the sectors, and 47,500 vacancies (not seasonally adjusted). Prior to the pandemic, the highest quarterly vacancy rates in this sector were in the first quarters of 2019 (4.2%) and 2020 (4.1%). The relatively high vacancy rate in this sector corresponds to a seasonal increase in demand for some services in this sector, such as tax preparation, during the first few months of the year. Looking ahead February SEPH data—to be released on April 29—will provide detailed information on sectors and subsectors that may have benefited from the loosening of COVID-19 public health measures, including retail stores, bars and restaurants and personal care services. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours With this release of January 2021 estimates, seasonally adjusted data have been revised based on the latest seasonal factors. Seasonally adjusted estimates have been revised historically back to 2001. Historical revisions have also been made to a small number of industries (four-digit level of the North American Classification System). The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. Payroll employment, as measured by the SEPH, refers to the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees, and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only, and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupations for Canada, the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wage and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable due to survey operations being temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates, and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. This release includes revised monthly estimates for October, November, and December 2020. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. In addition, year-over-year comparisons between estimates of different frequencies (month vs quarter) should be interpreted with caution as job vacancy statistics can vary month to month within a quarter. While JVWS employment is calibrated to Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ due to calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on April 19. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours and job vacancies for February will be released on April 29. Products More information about the concepts and use of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is available in the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). The product ""Earnings and payroll employment in brief: Interactive app"" (Catalogue number14200001) is now available. This interactive data visualization application provides a comprehensive picture of the Canadian labour market using the most recent data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours. The estimates are seasonally adjusted and available by province and largest industrial sector. Historical estimates going back 10 years are also included. The interactive application allows users to quickly and easily explore and personalize the information presented.

Percentage of total gross domestic product attributable to non-profit institutions 8.7% Fourth quarter 2020 Source(s): Table 36-10-0648-01. Real gross domestic product rises Real gross domestic product (GDP) of non-profit institutions rose 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, following a 2.4% increase in the third quarter of 2020. Increases in the second half of 2020 offset a 2.5% decline in the second quarter of 2020, as a number of non-profit institutions were mandated to temporarily suspend in-person services at that time. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product, non-profit institutions Similar to the real GDP of non-profit institutions, the economy-wide real GDP rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, following an 8.3% increase in the third quarter. During the year, real GDP of non-profit institutions (+1.5%) outperformed the economy-wide real GDP (-5.4%), mainly on the strength of government non-profit institutions, such as hospitals. Non-profits, excluding government institutions, dropped by 4.1% in 2020, as many organizations were impacted by COVID-19-related restrictions. Chart 2 Real gross domestic product, non-profit institutions, by subsector Real gross domestic product increases across non-profit institutions in the fourth quarter of 2020 In the fourth quarter of 2020, real GDP of non-profit institutions serving governments rose 0.9%—a 16th consecutive quarterly increase. Health care and education within non-profit institutions serving governments continued to operate throughout the year, as services were re-allocated and often migrated virtually to continue serving individuals. These continued services resulted in a 3.5% increase in real GDP for 2020 relative to 2019. Non-profit institutions serving households, such as grant-making and giving services, arts and recreation groups, and religious organizations, recorded higher levels of real GDP in the fourth quarter, up 3.2%, following a 6.3% increase in the third quarter. Despite the increase in the second half of 2020, levels remained lower than pre-pandemic highs, as cultural and recreational organizations and religious organizations were temporarily unable to operate in-person services throughout the pandemic. Real GDP of non-profit institutions serving businesses, such as chambers of commerce and business associations, rose 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020—the second consecutive quarterly increase. Non-profit institutions serving businesses recorded the largest annual decline of the three sectors, down 7.9% in 2020. Similar to non-profit institutions serving households, government-mandated business closures impacted real GDP growth in this sector. Non-profit employment increases Employment in non-profit institutions rose 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020, led by an increase in the number of jobs in social services. Excluding non-profit institutions serving governments, employment in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 4.8% as businesses continued to ramp up hiring following early pandemic cutbacks. On the year, employment declined 1.5% in non-profit institutions, while non-profit institutions excluding government institutions declined 6.0%, compared with an 8.2% decrease for the economy as a whole. For social service non-profit institutions, employment rose 11.7% in the fourth quarter, following a 33.2% increase in the third quarter. In 2020, the level of employment fell 0.6% on average, mainly owing to a 40% decline in the second quarter. Staffing within the health care sector declined 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The drop resulted in a 0.7% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2020, the number of jobs within health care remained flat—the only sector to record a non-negative decline in employment. Chart 3 Nominal gross domestic product, non-profit institutions, by activity Nominal gross domestic product of social services, business and professional associations grows Nominal gross domestic product of non-profit institutions rose 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020 on the strength of increased activity in social services (+7.3%), business and professional associations (+8.0%), and health care services (+0.9%). For non-profit institutions excluding government institutions, nominal GDP rose 4.5%, following a 7.7% increase in the third quarter. Overall, non-profit institutions represented 8.7% of the economy-wide nominal GDP in the fourth quarter—down from an 8.9% share in the third quarter. Nominal GDP in social services activities rose 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, nearly reaching pre-pandemic highs. Widespread government-mandated closures and suspended services resulted in a sharp decline in the second quarter (-25.3%), weighing down on 2020 levels. In the fourth quarter, business and professional associations recorded a higher level of nominal GDP (+8.0%) as levels reached record highs. The virtual migration of associations online and the re-opening of businesses contributed to the increase, although nominal GDP still declined in 2020, by 0.7%. Health care non-profit institutions recorded a 0.9% increase in nominal GDP—the third consecutive quarterly growth. Of all activities within non-profit institutions, health care recorded the largest increase in 2020, as services were rapidly re-allocated and expanded to combat COVID-19. Note to readers The non-profit indicators are quarterly indicators for the main aggregates in the Satellite Account of Non-profit Institutions and Volunteering, namely, gross domestic product, output and employment. The estimates from this account are directly comparable to the estimates in the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts. For the purposes of these estimates, the definition of the non-profit sector adheres to international standards published in the United Nations Handbook of Satellite Accounts on Non-profit and Related Institutions and Volunteer Work. Canada's overall non-profit sector is divided into three broad categories as follows: Community non-profits institutions include organizations engaged, for example, in social services, advocacy or sports and recreation. These make up the ""non-profit institutions serving households"" sector in standard macroeconomic measures. Business non-profits institutions include, for example, business associations, chambers of commerce and condominium associations. These are classified to the business sector in standard measures. Government non-profits institutions include hospitals, some residential care facilities, universities and colleges. These are classified to the government sector in standard measures.

From September to December 2020, just over three-quarters of Canadians told us that they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine, with marked differences observed in willingness by age, province and population subgroup. These findings are presented in a new study released today called ""COVID-19 vaccine willingness among Canadian population groups,"" which is based on responses from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine rises, mental health declines in November 2020 Following a summer respite, COVID-19 cases began rising again in the fall during the second wave of the pandemic. Then in December came promising news about the development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines. Widespread acceptance of the vaccine is important to help control the spread of COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy is a complex issue defined by the World Health Organization as a ""delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services."" From November to mid-December, 80.4% of Canadians reported they were somewhat or very likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This represents an increase from September, when 75.5% of Canadians reported a willingness to receive the vaccine. Moreover, an increase was observed in the proportion of Canadians who said they took certain precautions during this time, with over four-fifths reporting that they avoided leaving the house for non-essential reasons from November to mid-December (80.8%), up from two-thirds in September (67.0%). Also during this time, over one-third of Canadians told us their mental health had worsened since before the pandemic (37.3%), up from 29.6% in September. Vaccine willingness was higher in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and British Columbia Willingness to get the vaccine was not uniform across the country. From September to mid-December, a higher proportion of residents of Prince Edward Island (89.1%), Nova Scotia (81.5%) and British Columbia (81.4%) reported a willingness to get the vaccine, compared with the Canadian average. The differences between Canada and all other provinces were not statistically significant. Willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine varies markedly for diverse groups of Canadians Statistics Canada has previously reported that, for a number of reasons, population groups designated as visible minorities are at an increased risk of contracting or dying from COVID-19. Many of these population groups have higher poverty rates, are overrepresented in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, or live in overcrowded housing conditions. Additionally some visible minority groups are overrepresented in employment sectors where there is a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, such as Black and Filipino employees in the health care and social assistance industry. Among groups designated as visible minorities, willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 56.6% among the Black population to 82.5% among the South Asian population. At the time of the survey last fall, landed immigrants and non-permanent residents (74.6%) were less likely than Canadian-born individuals (77.7%) to report that they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine. No statistically significant differences were observed between recent and established immigrants. 72% of Indigenous people reported a willingness to receive the vaccine Nearly three-quarters of First Nations people living off reserve (74.2%) and Inuit (72.5%E) living outside Inuit Nunangat told us they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine, compared with just over two-thirds of Métis (67.8%). By way of comparison, just over three-quarters of respondents who were non-Indigenous (77.1%) were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine. Recent crowdsourced data from Statistics Canada found that Indigenous participants have also been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, especially with regard to their mental health and socioeconomic conditions. LGBTQ2+ Canadians are more likely to get the vaccine than non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians Based on multiple socioeconomic factors, including their higher representation in low-income groups and housing insecurity, LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 than other Canadians. Among LGBTQ2+ Canadians aged 15 and older, 83.3% reported last fall that they were somewhat or very willing to get the vaccine, compared with 76.8% of non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians. Older Canadians are more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine Seniors are the group most vulnerable to experiencing more severe outcomes of COVID-19, which is why they have higher priority for getting the vaccine. Perhaps it is not surprising then that last fall, more than four-fifths of Canadians aged 65 and older (82.5%) living in households said that they were somewhat or very willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, compared with three-quarters of Canadians aged 12 to 64 (75.5%). Black respondents aged 65 and older (78.1%) were much more likely than those aged 12 to 64 (54.9%) to say they were somewhat or very willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. There were no statistical differences in vaccine willingness by age group among LGBTQ2+ Canadians and Indigenous peoples. Note to readers The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is an annual survey that was adjusted during the pandemic to produce more timely estimates related to COVID-19. This analysis is based on CCHS data collected from September to mid-December 2020. The sample of more than 20,000 is representative of the Canadian population 12 years and older living in the provinces. Sampling and collection for the time period used in this analysis do not have adequate coverage to represent the entire population of the territories. Respondents were included in the analysis of the Indigenous population based on their self-reported answer to ""Are you an Aboriginal person, that is, First Nations, Métis or Inuk (Inuit)? First Nations includes Status and Non-Status Indians."" The CCHS does not collect data on reserves. Consequently, the results presented for First Nations people exclude those living on reserves, as well as Indigenous people in the territories or in remote northern regions of the provinces that include Inuit Nunangat. LGBTQ2+ Canadians include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or two-Spirit or persons reporting another non-binary gender or minority sexual identity. While members of these communities differ in the types of challenges and discrimination that they face depending on where they fall on the spectrum of sexual orientation and gender, this article groups them together due to the small sample size. Respondents were included in the LGBTQ2+ population based on self-reported sexual orientation, sex at birth and gender identity (transgender, including respondents with non-binary identities like genderqueer, gender fluid or agender). At this time, the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved in Canada have not been tested on children and are only available to those aged 16 and older. The CCHS includes respondents aged 12 and older, and the analysis in this article includes the entire population, since information on the willingness of Canadians aged 12 to 16 will be valuable once the vaccine becomes available for this age group. For more information on survey definitions and methods, refer to the Statistics Canada survey page: Canadian Community Health Survey. The symbol E next to an estimate indicates that the coefficient of variation for this estimate is between 15.1% and 35.0% and the quality is marginal. Users should interpret these results with caution. Products To help identify trends in COVID-19 indicators by age group and gender and by province and region, the interactive visual tool ""Canadians' Health and COVID-19: Interactive Dashboard"" has been updated with November estimates.

Health Canada is responsible for approving new vaccines after clinical research results confirm their effectiveness. Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is voluntary. As such, vaccine hesitancy could pose a threat to the success of a vaccination program (Dubé et al., 2013). Vaccine hesitancy is a complex issue defined by the World Health Organization as a delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services. Results from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) for the period of September 1 to December 12, 2020 show that 76.9% of Canadians (excluding residents of the territories) aged 12 and older reported being somewhat or very willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple reasons exist for why some Canadians are feeling hesitant towards receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. From the Canadian Perspective Survey Series 3, collected in June 2020, the most common reasons were lack of confidence in the safety of the vaccine (54.2%) and concerns about its risks and side effects (51.7%) (Frank and Arim 2020). These sources of concerns may have changed since vaccine testing and approval stages, which demonstrated their safety and effectiveness for authorized groups (Government of Canada, 2021). Although more than three-quarters of Canadians have indicated a willingness to receive the vaccine, there was some variation by province. Compared to the Canadian average, a higher proportion of residents living in Prince Edward Island (89.1%), Nova Scotia (81.5%) and British Columbia (81.4%) reported willingness. The differences between Canada and all other provinces were not statistically significant. Every individual has different lived experiences and beliefs, and this may influence vaccine hesitancy in different populations. This article focuses on vaccine willingness among certain populations that may have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding differences in vaccine willingness between populations can also help inform decision making, and public health messaging related to vaccines. Groups designated as visible minorities are at an increased risk of infection and mortality from COVID-19 (Subedi et al. 2020). One of the factors contributing to increased risk is over-representation in employment sectors where there is a greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, such as the over representation of Black and Filipino employees in the health care and social assistance industry (Turcotte and Savage, 2020). The National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI) has placed employees who work in sectors with greater risk of exposure in a higher priority group for receiving the COVID-19 vaccines (NACI, 2020). Among people designated as a visible minority, 74.8% reported being very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Some differences exist for willingness among particular visible minority groups. Compared to non-visible minorities (77.6%), a much lower proportion of the Black population (56.6%) reported being somewhat or very willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (Table 1). A lower rate of vaccine willingness was also seen among the Latin American population (66.0%). Conversely, a higher proportion of the South Asian population (82.5%) reported a willingness to receive the vaccine. Immigrants also have a disproportionately high representation in employment sectors with greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 (Statistics Canada, 2020). From September to December 2020, 74.6% of landed immigrants and non-permanent residents reported a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, a lower rate compared to the Canadian-born population (77.7%). There were no statistically significant differences between recent (less than 10 years living in Canada) and established immigrants (living in Canada for 10 years or more; data not shown; excluding non-permanent residents). Previous crowdsource collected data from Statistics Canada have indicated that Indigenous participants have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, with greater impacts to their mental health and socio-economic conditions (Arriagada et al., 2020a, 2020b). Compared to the non-Indigenous population, a lower proportion of Métis (67.8%) reported a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The differences between non-Indigenous (77.1%) and First Nations people living off reserve (74.2%), or Inuit (72.5%E) living outside of Inuit Nunangat, were not statistically significant. Based on multiple socio-economic factors, including over representation in low income categories and higher incidence rates of housing insecurity, LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 (Prokopenko and Kevins, 2020). A higher proportion of LGBTQ2+ Canadians (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or Two-Spirit or persons reporting another non-binary gender or minority sexual identity) aged 15 and older reported a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Among LGBTQ2+ Canadians, 83.3% were somewhat or very willing to receive the vaccine, compared to 76.8% of non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians. ﻿ Table 1 Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, by population groups, Canada excluding the territories Table summary This table displays the results of Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 Vaccine and 95% confidence intervals, calculated using percentage units of measure (appearing as column headers).

Older adults are at a higher risk of experiencing more severe outcomes from COVID-19, and are positioned in a higher priority group to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. When looking at the previously discussed populations by age group, the proportion of willingness was higher for those aged 65 and older for both Immigrants and the Black population, compared to their counterparts aged 12 to 64 (Table 2). For LGBTQ2+ and Indigenous people, there were no statistically significant differences in vaccine willingness by age group. Looking at vaccine willingness by gender, no statistically significant differences were observed in vaccine willingness by males and females for Indigenous people, LGBTQ2+ Canadians, immigrants, and people designated as a visible minority. ﻿ Table 2 Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, by population and age groups, Canada excluding the territories Table summary This table displays the results of Percentage of Canadians who were very or somewhat willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Total (aged 12 and older), Aged 12 to 64 (reference category) and Aged 65 and older, calculated using percentage units of measure (appearing as column headers).

Return to note 3 referrer Source: Canadian Community Health Survey (September to December 2020). Methodology The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is an annual survey that was adjusted during the pandemic to produce more frequent estimates on COVID-19 topics. This analysis is based on CCHS data collected from September to mid-December 2020. The sample of more than 20,000 is representative of the Canadian population aged 12 years and older living in the provinces. Sampling and collection for the time period used in this analysis does not have adequate coverage to represent the entire population of the territories. Respondents were included in the analysis for Indigenous peoples on the basis of their self-reported answer to “Are you an Aboriginal person, that is, First Nations, Métis or Inuk (Inuit)? First Nations includes Status and Non-Status Indians.” The CCHS does not collect data on reserves. Consequently, the results discussed for First Nations people exclude those living on reserves, as well as Indigenous peoples in the Territories or remote northern regions of the provinces which includes Inuit Nunangat. The sample size for Indigenous peoples was around 800 people. Currently the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved in Canada are only available to those aged 16 and older. The Canadian Community Health Survey includes respondents aged 12 and older, and the analysis in this article includes the entire population as the willingness of Canadians aged 12 to 16 will be valuable when the vaccine becomes available for this age group. All reported differences are statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.05. Bootstrap weights were used for significance tests. The term “visible minority” refers to Canadians designated as visible minorities as per the definition in the Employment Equity Act. The act defines minorities as “persons other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.” Visible minority groups include: South Asian; Chinese; Black; Filipino; Latin American; Arab; Southeast Asian; west Asian; Korean and Japanese. The term 'LGBTQ2+’ refers to persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, or persons reporting another non-binary gender or minority sexual identity. While members of these communities differ in the types of challenges and discrimination that they face depending on where they fall on the spectrums of sexual orientation and gender, this article groups them together due to small sample size. Respondents were included in the LGBTQ2+ population on the basis of self-reported sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another minority sexual identity such as asexual, pansexual or queer), sex at birth and gender identity (transgender, including respondents with non-binary identities like genderqueer, gender fluid or agender).

January Employment Insurance (EI) statistics reflect labour market conditions as of the week of January 10 to 16. During the reference week, public health measures already implemented for many regions of southern Ontario—including the closure of non-essential retail businesses—that were extended to the rest of the province effective December 26 were still in place. Existing public health measures also continued in Alberta and Manitoba, including the closure of in-person dining services, recreation facilities and personal care services, as well as restrictions on retail businesses. In Quebec, non-essential retail businesses were closed effective December 25, and a curfew implemented on January 14 further affected the operating hours of some businesses. Public health measures were eased between the EI statistics reference weeks in December and January in two provinces. In Prince Edward Island, restrictions that led to the closure of in-person dining and recreation and cultural facilities were lifted on December 18. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the surrounding area, restrictions on in-person dining were eased on January 4. Number of regular EI beneficiaries up sharply in January The number of Canadians receiving regular EI benefits rose 11.2% (+149,000) to 1.5 million in January. Results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicate that 1.9 million people were unemployed in January, including 1.5 million who were looking for work and 400,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Number of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries up sharply in January Proportion of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under new rules up in most provinces In September, temporary changes to the EI program, including a reduction in the number of required insured hours, were introduced to increase EI eligibility. In January, the proportion of EI recipients qualifying for EI under these new eligibility rules continued to grow in most provinces, with Newfoundland and Labrador (+2.3 percentage points) and Nova Scotia (+0.7 percentage points) posting the largest increases (not seasonally adjusted). Quebec was the only province to show a decline (-0.6 percentage points). Newfoundland and Labrador (16.8%) and Quebec (15.5%) had the highest proportions of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying for EI under the new rules, while Alberta (9.9%) had the lowest. Chart 1 Proportion of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules up in most provinces (not seasonally adjusted) Increase in number of regular EI beneficiaries concentrated in Ontario and Quebec In January, the increase in the number of regular EI beneficiaries was concentrated in Ontario (+82,000; +17.2%) and Quebec (+75,000; +25.0%), reflecting employment losses associated with public health measures implemented in both provinces at the end of December. The number of regular EI beneficiaries fell in British Columbia (-10,000; -6.7%), Nova Scotia (-3,000; -6.4%), New Brunswick (-1,000; -2.3%) and Saskatchewan (-600; -1.6%). The majority of the January increase in the number of regular EI beneficiaries occurred in census metropolitan areas (CMAs) (+108,000; +11.6%), particularly CMAs in Quebec (+59,000; +28.4%) and Ontario (+57,000; +14.0%). In January, the three largest CMAs—Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver—accounted for over one-third (36.0%) of total regular EI recipients, up from 21.5% a year earlier. Public health measures impact retail trade and accommodation and food services The number of regular EI recipients was up in all industries compared with 12 months earlier, with accommodation and food services (+251,000; +728.5%) and retail trade (+177,000; +438.8%) posting the largest increases (not seasonally adjusted). Illustrating the impact of ongoing public health measures, accommodation and food services (16.7%) continued to have the highest proportion of total regular EI recipients (not seasonally adjusted). According to January LFS data, employment in this industry was almost one-third (-31.4%) below its pre-pandemic February level, making this industry the one furthest from full recovery among all industries. Proportion of youth EI recipients on the rise Youth aged 15 to 24 accounted for 15.0% of total regular EI recipients in January, up from 9.1% one year earlier. The increase in proportion among young women (+4.1 percentage points) was more than double that among young men (+1.8 percentage points). January LFS results indicate that young women remained further from pre-pandemic employment levels than all other demographic groups. The number of core-aged (25 to 54 years) men receiving regular EI benefits rose by 46,000 (+11.2%) in January, while the increase among core-aged women was 33,000 (+8.3%). Combined, men and women who last worked in retail trade accounted for almost one-quarter (23.5%) of the monthly increase in regular EI recipients (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Proportion of youth regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries on the rise Looking ahead According to the January LFS results, 26.9% of all unemployed people in January had been continuously out of work for 27 weeks or more, an indication that many workers continued to face challenges resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market. This finding is reinforced by EI data, which show that 58.7% of regular EI recipients in January had received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for at least 7 of the 12 months before the survey, up from 15.6% one year earlier (not seasonally adjusted). Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit). Concepts and methodology The analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March 2020 to January 2021 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The number of regular EI beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from January 10 to 16. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals who qualified for EI only as a result of these program changes. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. EI beneficiaries by number of months on EI or Canada Emergency Response Benefit over the last year This supplementary indicator presents the number of regular EI recipients who received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for a defined number of total months over the last 12 months. A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – Definitions for more information. Data availability Data tables 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337 remain suspended as of the December 2019 reference period, because of occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is ongoing to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. Data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008 remain suspended as of the March 2020 reference period, because a source data file contains records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. In the data table 14-10-0009, for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed because of data quality. Next release Data on EI for February 2021 will be released on April 22, 2021.

Copy data Notes The data contained in the provincial map are annual and on a customs basis. The export values in this data visualization represent the “domestic exports” of a province, as opposed to total exports which include re-exports. Data at the Canada level are also showing domestic exports. Imports by province are based on the concept of province of clearance, which is the Canadian province (or territory) associated with the customs office responsible for clearing the goods for entry into Canada. Exports by province are based on the concept of province of origin, or province of production. Data in this visualization can be found in table 12-10-0133-01Opens a new window. Notes The data contained in the data visualizations are annual, on a customs basis and not seasonally adjusted. The North American Product Classification System (NAPCS)Opens a new window is used for the product aggregates. In the world map, the “net export” variable was calculated by subtracting import from export values on a customs basis. The net export variable differs from the concept of “trade balance”, which is calculated by subtracting import from export values on a balance of payment basis. Unless otherwise specified, exports are “total exports” (domestic exports plus re-exports). In the provincial view, the export values represent the “domestic exports” of a province, as opposed to total exports which include re-exports. Data at the Canada level are also showing domestic exports. Domestic exports are goods grown, produced, extracted, or manufactured in Canada, including goods of foreign origin that have been materially transformed in Canada. In the provincial view, imports by province are based on the province of clearance concept, which is the Canadian province (or territory) associated with the customs office responsible for clearing the goods for entry into Canada. This may not always be the province (or territory) into which the goods physically entered the country, or the province in which the goods are ultimately consumed. Exports by province are based on the concept of province of origin, or province of production. Under the “by product” function on the provincial view, in the product table at the right, “..” means no data were reported for that specific data point, while a zero (0) means that there are data, but they were rounded to zero. Data in this table are in millions of dollars. On a customs basis, it is the country of origin that determines the trading partner from which the goods were imported. For exports, the trading partner is based on the country of final destination. In the import view of the world map, Canada is showing some significant values as a country of origin for imports into Canada. This is normal and legitimate as products of Canadian origin can sometimes return to Canada without being materially transformed in another country. The countries displayed in the world map are countries identified as Canada’s trading partners. This definition may not always align with other standard definitions of sovereign countries. The tree map visualization provides data for Canada’s 27 Principal Trading Partners (PTPs) down to the NAPCS Group level of detail. This level of detail offers an extra layer of analysis to users while insuring an optimal performance of the tool. If a country shows “no data”, it is either because no trade was reported between Canada and that country, or because the data of the country was incorporated into the data of another country. The countries that have their data incorporated with another country are listed below: Comoros includes data from Mayotte. Finland includes data from Aland Islands. France includes data from: French Guiana Guadeloupe Martinique Monaco Reunion Israel includes data from State of Palestine. Italy includes data from: Holy See (Vatican) San Marino Kiribati includes data from Tuvalu. New Zealand includes data from Tokelau. Norway includes data from Svalbard Island.

February Employment Insurance (EI) statistics reflect labour market conditions as of the week of February 14 to 20. Ahead of the February reference week, non-essential businesses, cultural and recreation facilities, and in-person dining reopened in many provinces, subject to capacity limits and various other public health requirements. Public health measures were relaxed in Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on February 8, although a curfew remained in effect in Quebec. Measures were loosened in many regions of Ontario on February 10 and 15, although stay-at-home orders remained in place in the health regions of Toronto, Peel, York and North Bay Parry Sound. In Manitoba, various measures were eased on February 12. In contrast, Newfoundland and Labrador reintroduced a lockdown on February 12, requiring the widespread closure of non-essential businesses and services. Number of regular EI beneficiaries up in February The number of Canadians receiving regular EI benefits rose 3.6% (+53,000) to 1.5 million in February, following an 11.2% increase in January. Results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicate that employment increased 259,000 in February, following two months of losses, while unemployment fell to 1.7 million, including 1.4 million who were looking for work and 300,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries up in February Female youth more likely than other age groups to qualify for regular EI under the new rules In September 2020, temporary changes to EI eligibility criteria were introduced to support workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In February, 14.2% of regular EI recipients—including almost one-quarter (23.0%) of those aged 15 to 24—qualified under these new eligibility criteria. Chart 1 Proportion of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules in February, by age group and sex (not seasonally adjusted) Number of regular EI beneficiaries increases in seven provinces The number of regular EI beneficiaries rose in seven provinces in February, led by Ontario (+35,000; +6.3%), British Columbia (+18,000; +13.2%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (+10,000; +22.0%). Almost three-quarters of the increase observed in Ontario was attributable to regular EI beneficiaries who also worked at some point during the reference week, reflecting the loosening of public health measures in the province during that week. Reflecting the reintroduction of strict public health measures in Newfoundland and Labrador, almost one in four individuals (22.6%) in the labour force in that province received regular EI benefits in February. The increase observed in Newfoundland and Labrador was almost entirely driven by EI beneficiaries who did not work during the reference week. At the same time, Quebec (-18,000; -4.8%), Alberta (-2,000; -1.0%) and Manitoba (-1,000; -1.4%) posted decreases in the number of regular EI recipients. On a regional basis, census metropolitan areas (CMAs) (+29,000; +2.8%) recorded the largest increase in regular EI recipients, followed by regions outside CMAs and census agglomerations (+15,000; +5.9%). Industries most impacted by public health measures account for over one-third of regular EI recipients According to February LFS results, employment remained below pre-COVID-19 levels in the industries most impacted by public health measures, including accommodation and food services (-26.1%); information, culture and recreation (-15.1%); other services (-6.0%); and retail trade (-5.4%). The profile of regular EI recipients further illustrates the impact of pandemic response measures on these same industries. In February, more than one-third (38.7%) of all regular EI recipients last worked in one of these four industries, compared with 19.4% one year previously (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Industries most impacted by public health measures account for over one-third of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries (not seasonally adjusted) Young women particularly hard hit by public health measures In February, women accounted for a larger proportion of regular EI recipients in all age groups, compared with one year previously. The increase among female youth aged 15 to 24 years, who accounted for 44.9% of all youth regular EI beneficiaries, compared with 29.9% in February 2020, was particularly notable. Results from the February LFS show that year-over-year employment losses among young women were almost double those among young men, indicating that young women have been particularly hard hit by pandemic-related public health measures. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit). Concepts and methodology The analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March 2020 to February 2021 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The number of regular EI beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from February 14 to 20. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals who qualified for EI only as a result of these program changes. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. EI beneficiaries by number of months on EI or Canada Emergency Response Benefit over the last year This supplementary indicator presents the number of regular EI recipients who received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for a defined number of total months over the last 12 months. A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – Definitions for more information. Data availability Data tables 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337 remain suspended as of the December 2019 reference period, because of occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is ongoing to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. Data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008 remain suspended as of the March 2020 reference period, because a source data file contains records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. In the data table 14-10-0009, for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed because of data quality. Next release Data on EI for March 2021 will be released on May 20, 2021.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.2% on a year-over-year basis in March, up from a 1.1% gain in February. A significant proportion of this increase was attributable to a steep decline in prices in March 2020, as the monthly CPI rose 0.5% in March 2021. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.1% in March. Excluding energy, the CPI rose 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. As Canada marked the end of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, price growth in March 2021 was accentuated by what is known as base-year effects, originating in March 2020. The broad decline in prices in spring 2020, when headline CPI growth slowed to 0.9% in March 2020, had an upward impact on consumer inflation in March 2021. As the upward impact of these temporary base-year effects will influence the 12-month movement over the next few months, the historical movements affecting current growth trends will be examined. Base-year effects and the CPI: The COVID-19 experience The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a standard measure of the price of a representative basket of goods and services. The headline consumer inflation is measured as the percentage change between the CPI in the current month (March 2021) and the CPI in a base month or the same calendar month of the previous year (March 2020). A base-year effect refers to the impact that price movements from 12 months earlier have on the current month's headline consumer inflation. When a large downward price change in the base month stops influencing—or falls out of—the 12-month price movement, this has an upward effect on the headline CPI in the current month. Conversely, a large upward price change in the base month creates downward pressure on the current month's measure. In spring 2020, the global economy was dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Canadian consumers experienced a significant decline in prices from February to April 2020. Headline consumer inflation slowed from +2.2% in February 2020 to +0.9% in March and -0.2% in April, the largest two-month slowdown in year-over-year CPI growth since 1992. The broad decline in prices at the onset of the pandemic, led by prices for energy products and travel services, had an upward impact on the year-over-year rate of consumer inflation in March 2021 because significantly lower prices from March 2020 were used as the basis for year-over-year comparisons. For instance, gasoline prices were 35.3% higher in March 2021 compared with March 2020, when prices reached a four-year low in the early weeks of the pandemic. The upward impact of these base-year effects will be temporary. In the coming months, the price declines observed in March and April 2020 will fall out of the 12-month price movement. Users should consider the impact of base-year effects when interpreting the 12-month price movement in the coming months. Chart 1 The 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding energy Chart 2 Energy prices rise in March Highlights Year over year, consumer price growth increased within a context of rising consumer confidence and improving employment conditions as COVID-19 restrictions eased in many regions of the country. In March, prices rose in five of the eight major components year over year, with transportation (+7.1%) and shelter (+2.4%) prices contributing the most to CPI growth. Compared with March 2020, consumers paid less for clothing and footwear (-5.4%) and for household operations, furnishings and equipment (-0.2%). Chart 3 Prices rise in five of eight major components Energy prices rise on higher demand and lower supply Gasoline prices led the increase in consumer energy prices, rising 35.3% year over year in March, the largest gain in gasoline prices since March 2000. The price increase was mainly driven by growing global oil demand, as well as the continuation of production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus. Lower prices for gasoline in March 2020 also contributed to the year-over-year increase in March 2021 as a result of the base-year effect. Crude oil prices fell significantly at this time in the previous year as demand for oil dropped because of COVID-19 lockdown measures, leaving an oversupply in the market. As this historical year-over-year decrease ceased to impact the 12-month movement, an additional temporary upward effect influenced the pace of the year-over-year increase in the gasoline index this March. Infographic 1 Gasoline prices rise in March Similarly, prices for natural gas (+14.1%) and fuel oil and other fuels (+7.7%) increased year over year in March. Homeowners' replacement costs push shelter prices higher Shelter prices rose 2.4% on a year-over-year basis in March. As costs for building materials and demand for single-family homes continued to grow, the homeowners' replacement cost index, linked to new home prices, increased 7.9% year over year. The rise in the homeowners' replacement cost index, which comprises about 5% of the CPI basket weight, was partially offset by a drop in the mortgage interest cost index. The mortgage interest cost index, which makes up about 4% of the CPI basket weight, fell 6.3% year over year. Chart 4 Yearly price changes in mortgage interest cost and homeowners' replacement cost Consumers pay more for eggs and dairy products in March Year-over-year growth in the food purchased from stores index remained steady at 1.3% in March, the same increase reported in February. Consumers paid 11.4% more for eggs year over year and 2.4% more for dairy products. Although these products contributed the most to the increase in prices of food purchased from stores, the increase was mainly attributable to lower prices in March 2020. During the early days of the pandemic, demand for eggs plummeted, with the closure of restaurants and other food services causing a surplus in the market. By contrast, prices for fresh or frozen beef fell 2.1% year over year in March, following a 0.3% gain in February, because of increased supply. Regional highlights Year over year, prices rose at a faster pace in March than in February in every province, primarily because of higher gasoline prices. Chart 5 The Consumer Price Index rises at a faster pace in every province Energy prices rise in Alberta and Ontario In Alberta, prices for natural gas were up 35.6% compared with March 2020, when prices declined because of lower demand during the early stages of the pandemic. Electricity prices in Ontario were up 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. On January 1, 2021, following a province-wide lockdown to reduce COVID-19 infections, the provincial government set all time-of-use electricity prices to the off-peak rate. This fixed pricing ended on February 22, 2021, resulting in higher prices for on-peak and mid-peak electricity consumption. Rent prices increase in Atlantic Canada Rent prices rose in all four Atlantic provinces year over year in March: New Brunswick (+4.8%), Prince Edward Island (+2.9%), Newfoundland and Labrador (+2.2%), and Nova Scotia (+2.0%). Higher demand as a result of increased migration and fewer homes for sale contributed to the increase.

Goods and services in the CPI that were not available to consumers in March because of COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, effectively removing their impact on the monthly CPI. The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the all-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, personal care services in some areas, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. The price indexes for beer served in licensed establishments, wine served in licensed establishments and liquor served in licensed establishments were imputed in several regions, using the indexes to which consumers likely redirected their expenditures: beer purchased from stores, wine purchased from stores and liquor purchased from stores. Consistent with previous months affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for suspended flights are excluded from the March CPI calculation because passengers were ultimately unable to consume them. As a result, selected sub-components of the air transportation index were imputed from the parent index (air transportation). Detailed documentation is available in the ""Technical Supplement for the March 2021 Consumer Price Index,"" within the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M). It provides further details on the imputations used to compile the March 2021 CPI. Explore the Consumer Price Index Check out the Personal Inflation Calculator!

For more recent information on the sale of alcoholic beverages, the monthly release of retail trade sales by province and territory (table 20-10-0008-01) on May 21, 2021 will contain total sales by beer, wine and liquor stores for the March 2021 reference period. Canadians over the legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 9.5 standard alcoholic beverages a week in 2019/2020, totalling 3,084 million litres. This was down 0.3% from a year earlier and the first decrease in volume in six years. Beer remained the alcoholic beverage of choice for Canadians, but it continued to lose market share to wine, spirits and ciders and coolers. Retail sales data show that alcohol sales for March 2020 were up 17.5% from the previous month and up 19.2% compared with sales in March 2019. Liquor authorities confirmed this surge in sales. Many of them reported that their customers were stockpiling alcohol in the last two weeks of March 2020 because of the uncertainty about potential closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail sales data also show an increase in alcohol sales for the 10-month period from April 2020 to January 2021. If this trend continues, sales for the year ending March 2021—the first full year of alcohol sales that reflect pandemic-related purchasing habits—will have increased significantly from the year before. Chart 1 Sale of standard drinks per week per person over the legal drinking age, 2019/2020 Total beer sales by liquor stores, agencies and other retail outlets fell 1.9% to $9.2 billion during the fiscal year 2019/2020—the largest sales decline since 1994 and the first decrease in six years. Wine sales rebounded from their slow growth a year earlier (+0.2%), rising 5.2% to $7.8 billion in 2019/2020. Sales of spirits grew 6.0% to $6.0 billion. Cider and cooler sales rose at the fastest pace among all alcohol types for the eighth straight year, up 17.2% to $1.3 billion in 2019/2020. While beer remained the alcoholic beverage of choice for Canadians in 2019/2020, accounting for 37.8% of total alcohol sales, it lost 1.9% of its market share to wine (+0.6% to 32.2%), spirits (+0.7% to 24.6%) and ciders and coolers (+0.6% to 5.4%). Chart 2 Market share by type of beverage and year, 2004/2005 to 2019/2020 Overall, $24.4 billion worth of alcoholic beverages were sold in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, up 3.1% from a year earlier. Net income and other government revenue derived from the control and sale of alcoholic beverages, including excise taxes, retail sales taxes, specific taxes on alcohol, and licence and permit revenues, increased 3.1% to $12.8 billion. Beer sales per person hits new low Beer sales fell 1.9% to $9.2 billion in 2019/2020. Residents of Nunavut were most likely to buy beer (66.8% of total sales), while those in British Columbia (31.4%) were the least likely to do so. By volume, beer sales declined by 3.2% to 2 139 million litres or 71.1 litres of beer per person over the legal drinking age. This was the lowest per person volume ever reported for beer sales since Statistics Canada began tracking alcohol sales in 1950. Chart 3 Beer sales by volume, per person over the legal drinking age, 1949/1950 to 2019/2020 Canadians over the legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 4.0 standard bottles of beer a week in 2019/2020 (see Note to readers). Wine sales continue to grow Wine sales rose 5.2% to $7.8 billion in 2019/2020 – the largest increase in eight years. While beer was the alcoholic beverage of choice across much of Canada last year, wine claimed the top spot in Quebec (45.1% of total sales) and British Columbia (34.3%). Residents of Saskatchewan (15.2%) were least likely to buy wine. Chart 4 Market share of alcohol by type and geography, 2019/2020 Red was the wine of choice for just over half of Canadians (53.2%), followed by white (33.5%), sparkling (6.4%) and rosé, fortified and other wines (7.0%). Canadians of legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 2.5 glasses of wine in 2019/2020. By volume, wine sales increased by 4.1% to 527 million litres. Spirit sales rise Spirit sales rose 6.0% from a year earlier to $6.0 billion during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. Spirits were the biggest seller in the Northwest Territories (42.7% of total sales) and accounted for the smallest share in neighbouring Nunavut (9.8%). Overall, sales of Canadian spirits increased by 5.9% while imported spirit sales rose 6.1%. Nationally, whisky (29.9%), vodka (25.0%) and rum (15.1%) were the most popular spirits sold in Canada in 2019/2020, accounting for over two-thirds (70.0%) of total spirit sales. Chart 5 Market share of spirits by type and geography, 2019/2020 Canadians over the legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 2.5 shots of spirits per week in 2019/2020. By volume, spirits sold increased 4.0% to 181.3 million litres. Among spirits, gin sales have grown at the fastest pace over the past decade, rising by almost two-thirds (+63.3%) from 2009/2010 to 2019/2020. Ciders, coolers and other refreshment beverages remains the fastest growing alcoholic beverage Canadians bought $1.3 billion worth of ciders and coolers in 2019/2020, up 17.2% from the previous fiscal year. Residents of Yukon (9.8% of total sales) were most likely to buy ciders and coolers while those in Quebec (1.4%) were the least likely to do so. In terms of volume, 236.9 million litres of ciders and coolers were sold in 2019/2020, up 15.6% from the previous fiscal year. Spirit cooler sales have more than doubled over the past decade. Since 2009/2010, the volume of sales rose by 166.3%. Note to readers Comparability and limitations of data Data on sales of alcoholic beverages by volume should not be equated with data on consumption of alcoholic beverages. Sales volumes only include sales as reported by the liquor authorities and their agencies, including sales by wineries, breweries and other outlets that operate under license from the liquor authorities. Statistics on sales of alcoholic beverages by dollar value should not be equated with consumer expenditures on alcoholic beverages. The sales data refer to the revenues received by liquor authorities and their agents, and a portion of these revenues include sales to licensed establishments such as bars and restaurants, some of which would be considered as business intermediate expenses. The value of sales of alcoholic beverages excludes all sales taxes, the value of returnable containers, and deposits. Absolute volume of sales of alcoholic beverages is calculated by multiplying the sales volume by the percentage of alcohol content for each product category. Standard drink According to Health Canada guidelines, a standard drink is defined as a 341 mL (12 oz.) beer, cooler, or cider with 5% alcohol content, a 142 mL (5 oz.) glass of wine with 12% alcohol content, or a 43 mL (1.5 oz.) spirit drink with 40% alcohol. Legal drinking age versus per capita Standard drinks per week per person are calculated for each person over the legal drinking age in Canada. The legal drinking age is 19 years and older in every province and territory except Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta, where it is 18 years and older. Per capita sales by value and volume are based on the population of inhabitants aged 15 years and older. This allows comparability with other countries, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Health Organization as they also present alcohol-per-capita data using the population of inhabitants aged 15 years and older.

February data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are now available. The SEPH provides an account of payroll employment—that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits during a given month—as well as earnings and hours worked. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which provides an account of the number of people working during a specific week in the month, data from the SEPH and the JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions in Canada. Payroll employment increases in February The number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer—measured in the SEPH as payroll employment—increased by 43,400 (+0.3%) in February. This followed a notable decline in January, when employment losses associated with the tightening of public health restrictions were recorded by both the SEPH and the LFS. The February increase in SEPH payroll employment was smaller than the LFS employment increase (+259,000; +1.4%), partly because of lags in new or returning employees receiving their first paycheques. The largest increases in payroll employment were in Quebec (+27,200; +0.8%), Alberta (+19,600; +1.1%) and British Columbia (+9,400; +0.4%). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Ontario (-20,800; -0.3%), where public health restrictions remained in place for Toronto, Peel and North Bay Parry Sound throughout the month. Consistent with the February LFS results, the largest increases were in the accommodation and food services (+14,700; +1.7%) and retail trade (+13,300; +0.7%) sectors. The total number of payroll employees in February was down 1.2 million (-6.8%) from one year earlier, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in February after dip in January Average weekly earnings up in February Average weekly earnings were $1,140 in February, up 0.7% compared with January and 9.0% compared with one year earlier. Year-over-year earnings growth reflects a number of factors, including the changes over the period in the number of hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees, compared with salaried employees. In February, the number of hourly paid employees was 9.2% below its pre-COVID-19 level, compared with a gap of 4.3% for salaried employees. Average hours worked increase for hourly paid employees Average hours worked per week for hourly paid employees were 32.0 in February, 4.2% higher than one year earlier, as the remaining hourly employees worked more hours on average. In comparison, the average hours worked per week for salaried employees were 37.0, up 0.5% from one year earlier. Payroll employment increases in services-producing sector as public health measures ease in many provinces Payroll employment increases in the services-producing sector (+64,000; +0.5%) were partially offset by a decline in the goods-producing sector (-13,200; -0.5%) in February. The largest month-over-month payroll employment increases in February were in accommodation and food services (+14,700; +1.7%) and retail trade (+13,300; +0.7%), likely the result of public health measures being eased in many jurisdictions. Despite these increases, these two sectors remained two of the furthest from pre-COVID-19 February 2020 levels, with payroll employment down 32.5% year over year in accommodation and food services and 7.0% in retail trade. Within retail trade, year-over-year employment changes varied by subsector. Payroll employment in clothing and clothing accessories stores was 32.2% lower than one year earlier, while in general merchandise stores, it was 5.4% higher. In February, these two sectors also continued to have the lowest average weekly earnings, at $459 in accommodation and food services and $642 in retail trade, despite year-over-year earnings growth of 6.9% and 2.5%, respectively. Upward trends continue for payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services, and health care and social assistance In February, payroll employment rose by 9,600 (+1.0%) in professional, scientific and technical services, one of the sectors least affected by public health measures. Most of the monthly growth was in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, with increases spread across several industries. Employment in the sector was up 1.5% compared with its pre-COVID-19 February 2020 level. In health care and social assistance, payroll employment rose for a ninth consecutive month, up 9,100 (+0.4%) in February. This month-over-month rise was driven by increases in hospitals and in ambulatory health care services. Payroll employment in the sector was 0.7% above its pre-COVID-19 February 2020 level. Payroll employment down in administrative and support services, and in arts, entertainment and recreation Payroll employment declined in the administrative and support services (-10,500; -1.3%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (-3,600; -1.9%) sectors in February. The February decline in administrative and support services was the first since May, and it was largely in employment services (which include employment placement agencies) and services to buildings and dwellings. Despite trending up in recent months, payroll employment in administrative and support services has not yet returned to its pre-COVID-19 February 2020 level, with employment in February 2021 down 7.4% year over year. In arts, entertainment and recreation—the sector furthest below its pre-pandemic employment level (-41.0%)—the February 2021 decline was driven by other amusement and recreation industries (which include, for example, recreational, sport and fitness centres and bowling centres). Job vacancies in health care and social assistance hit new record high In February, health care and social assistance had more job vacancies (112,800, not seasonally adjusted) than any other sector for the fourth consecutive month. Vacancies in this sector represented more than one-fifth of all vacancies in Canada. The job vacancy rate, which represents vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied), was 5.2% in health care and social assistance in February, the highest vacancy rate of all sectors. This was the highest job vacancy rate for this sector since monthly job vacancy estimates became available in October 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quarterly job vacancy rate for this sector ranged from 3.0% to 3.3% from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Following a decline during the first wave of COVID-19, payroll employment in health care and social assistance has been trending upward, surpassing its pre-COVID-19 level in December 2020. The high level of vacancies and the high job vacancy rate indicate that, despite this increase in employment, employers in health care and social assistance continued to face staffing challenges as they addressed the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 505,900 positions in February (not seasonally adjusted), corresponding to a job vacancy rate of 3.3%. This follows rates between 3.0% and 3.9% from October 2020 to January 2021. British Columbia (4.9%) and Quebec (3.6%) continued to have the highest job vacancy rates among the provinces (not seasonally adjusted). Looking ahead March SEPH data—to be released on May 27—will provide detailed information on sectors and subsectors that may have benefited from the further loosening of COVID-19 public health measures that month. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. Payroll employment, as measured by the SEPH, refers to the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and the LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and the SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupation for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wages and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on May 17. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours, and job vacancies for March will be released on May 27. Products More information about the concepts and use of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is available in the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G).

Retail sales — Nvt. $46.0 millions February 2021 -2.4% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 20-10-0008-01. Retail sales were up 4.8% to $55.1 billion in February. Sales increased in 9 of 11 subsectors, led by higher sales at motor-vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor-vehicle and parts dealers—rose for the first time in three months, increasing 3.8% in February on higher sales at general merchandise stores and at clothing and clothing accessories stores. In volume terms, retail sales increased 4.3% in February. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public-health measures in several regions across the country that directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, approximately 12% of retailers were closed during February. The average length of the shutdown was two business days. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued cooperation. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales increased 2.3% in March. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 65% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 90.4%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in February Sales at motor-vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations post consecutive gains Sales at motor-vehicle and parts dealers increased for the second consecutive month, rising 5.0% in February. The increase was mostly because of higher sales at new car dealers (+5.6%) and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (+9.2%), some of which were closed in January as a result of lockdowns in select regions. In contrast, sales at other motor vehicle dealers contracted 2.3% in February. Sales at gasoline stations also increased for the second month in a row, rising 12.3% in February—their largest increase since June 2020. Contributing to the increase were higher gasoline prices, which were up on a month-over-month basis. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations rose 6.8% following four consecutive declines. Core retail sales up on higher sales at general merchandise stores and non-essential retailers After two consecutive months of declines, core retail sales increased 3.8% in February, led by higher sales at general merchandise stores (+6.1%). Clothing and clothing accessories stores also contributed to the increase in core retail, rising 23.7% in February—its first gain since September 2020. Sales were up in all three subcategories, coinciding with the easing of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on non-essential retailers and malls in many parts of the country. In February, approximately 39% of clothing and clothing accessories stores reported having been closed for an average of 6 days, compared with 48% of those retailers who reported closures for an average of 13 days in January. On the heels of two consecutive declines, sales increased at furniture and home furnishings stores (+18.0%) and sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+23.5%) in February. In contrast, sales at food and beverage stores were down 1.4% in February. The decrease was mostly driven by lower sales at specialty food stores (-12.7%). Chart 2 Sales up in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales up in six provinces Sales were up in six provinces in February, with Quebec and Ontario leading the gain. In Quebec, sales rose by almost one-fifth in February (+19.0%)—their largest increase since June 2020. Motor-vehicle and parts dealers in the province reported higher sales, leading the gain amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in February. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montréal, sales were up 20.4%. In Ontario, sales rose 2.3% on increased sales at gasoline stations and at clothing and clothing accessories stores. Sales fell 1.9% in the CMA of Toronto, coinciding with the continuation of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in the region. Retail e-commerce in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 92.0% year over year to $3.1 billion in February, accounting for 6.8% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce out of total retail sales was 1.3 percentage points lower in February, as more brick-and-mortar stores were allowed to open their doors to in-person shopping. On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 5.7% in February. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers With this release, unadjusted monthly data were revised back to January 2020, while seasonally adjusted data (including retail e-commerce) were revised back to January 2017. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of respondent information, the correction of information in the data provided, the replacement of estimated figures with actual values (once available), the re-classification of companies within, into, and out of the retail trade sector, and updates to seasonal factors. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally-adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally-adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis-store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis-store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see Retail E-Commerce in Canada. Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes. Real-time tables Real-time tables 20-10-0054-01 and 20-10-0079-01 will be updated soon. Next release Data on retail trade for March will be released on May 21.

Over the 2017-to-2019 period, approximately 80% of Canadian businesses indicated that they were engaged in innovative practices and strategies. Businesses are considered innovative if they introduce or bring into use new or improved goods, services or business processes that differed significantly from their previous, goods, services or business processes. Larger businesses (250 or more employees) were more likely to be innovative (85.8%) than businesses with fewer employees, with 79.0% of businesses with fewer than 100 employees being innovative in the 2017-to-2019 reference period. Ontario had the highest share of innovative businesses (83.1%), followed by the ""rest of Canada"" category (which includes Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut) at 79.4%, Quebec (77.9%), and the Atlantic region (68.5%). Business activities also figure into the propensity to be innovative. Sectors that had among the highest rates of innovation in the 2017 Survey of Innovation and Business Strategy (SIBS) continued to rank high in SIBS 2019. The professional, scientific and technical services sector posted the highest proportion of innovative businesses (89.1%), followed by the information and cultural industries sector (88.8%) and the wholesale trade sector (83.3%). Conversely, the management of companies and enterprises sector (60.8%) and the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector (65.4%) had the lowest proportion of innovative businesses. Chart 1 Percentage of innovative businesses in Canada by employment size, 2017 to 2019 Businesses report cost savings from their business process innovations During the three-year period, 52.7% of businesses introduced or brought into use product (good or service) innovations. The rate was even higher for business process innovations (72.7%). Among businesses that introduced business process innovations from 2017 to 2019, 4 in 10 (39.3%) reported that their innovations resulted in cost savings related to the production of goods or services. Additionally, one-third of businesses were able to save on costs related to support business functions. A higher proportion of large businesses reported cost savings on the production of goods or services (51.5%) and support business functions (44.5%) from their business process innovations. For small businesses, 37.6% saved on the production of goods or services, while 32.4% were able to save costs on support business functions. Less than one-fifth of businesses cooperate with others on innovation activities Fewer than one in five (17.8%) businesses cooperated on innovation activities with other businesses or organizations. Among these businesses, 53.0% cooperated with suppliers, while 43.0% cooperated with their parent, affiliated or subsidiary businesses. Suppliers were also ranked as the most critical partner for cooperation on innovation activities by 33.0% of businesses, followed by parent, affiliated or subsidiary businesses (28.7%). For these key cooperation partners, over four-fifths of suppliers (88.0%) and affiliated businesses (81.9%) were located in Canada. From a sectoral perspective, businesses in the finance and insurance sector (excluding the monetary authorities subsector) had the highest rate of cooperation related to innovation activities (35.4%). By contrast, businesses in the construction sector had the lowest rate (10.1%) of cooperation. Over half of businesses report that their innovations with environmental benefits are new to their market During the 2017-to-2019 period, businesses acknowledged a number of environmental benefits associated with product or process innovations. For instance, nearly half of businesses indicated that they experienced an environmental benefit from production through efficient use of resources. Businesses also highlighted that the innovation they introduced had environmental benefits related to the consumer or end user (35.8%). Among businesses that introduced innovations with environmental benefits, three in five (60.3%) reported that their innovations related to the consumer or end user were new to the business's market. As well, over half of all businesses that introduced innovations with environmental benefits related to increased environmental protection activities or efficient use of resources, indicated that these innovations were new to their markets. Three in 10 businesses used government programs to aid innovation-related activities Approximately 3 in 10 businesses in Canada indicated that they used various types of government programs from various levels of government to aid in their innovation-related activities over the 2017-to-2019 period. This statistic was driven by small businesses (28.4%), whereas, among large businesses, 42.0% accessed government programs for aid on innovation activities. These government aid programs included tax incentives, grants, procurement, training and hiring, and other support programs. Of businesses that used at least one government program, 38.3% found that training and hiring programs were the most critical for innovation-related activities. This statistic, however, hides underlying differences between large and small businesses. Small businesses preferred the use of government training and hiring programs, while large businesses favoured tax incentive or tax credit programs. Businesses in Quebec had the highest usage rate of government programs (35.4%) for innovation-related activities, followed by businesses in the Atlantic region (32.3%), Ontario (31.7%), and the rest of Canada (24.5%). Chart 2 Proportion of businesses that used a government program to aid innovation-related activities and the programs that they found most critical, 2017 to 2019 Over half of Canadian businesses face obstacles to innovation Slightly more than half of all businesses in Canada reported that they faced obstacles related to innovation in 2019. Of these obstacles, almost one in three cited lack of skills (29.7%) and uncertainty and risk (29.3%) as the most frequent barriers. Chart 3 Obstacles to innovation faced by Canadian businesses, 2019 Most businesses that encountered obstacles indicated that they took measures to overcome them. For nearly every type of obstacle, businesses reported that their measures were successful in mitigating them with the exception of obstacles related to innovation from regulatory or government competition policies. Of the businesses that took measures to address this obstacle, 39.3% found success in mitigating it. The vast majority of businesses did not use government programs as a means to overcome obstacles to innovation. For instance, government programs aimed towards external financing barriers were used by about one in five businesses (22.3%). Furthermore, 4.4% of businesses sought government assistance to overcome obstacles related to market size. Note to readers The 2019 Survey of Innovation and Business Strategy (SIBS) is a joint initiative of Statistics Canada; Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada; Global Affairs Canada; the Bank of Canada; the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; the Institut de la statistique du Québec; and the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. SIBS is the primary source of business innovation data for the Canadian economy. Between the release of the 2017 SIBS and 2019 SIBS results, the definition of what constitutes innovation changed slightly. As a result of changes in terminology and content between the 2019 SIBS and previous iterations of SIBS, caution is recommended when making comparisons at more detailed levels of aggregation. Data for the 2015-to-2017 and 2017-to-2019 reference periods are available by sector, according to the North American Industry Classification System; by enterprise size; and by economic region, according to the Standard Geographical Classification. Data from the 2009 and the 2012 SIBS are available in archived tables (Catalogue number12-604-X). Definitions Definition of innovation in the 2019 SIBS: An innovation is a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the unit's previous products or processes and that has been made available to potential users (product) or brought into use by the unit (process) [Source: Oslo Manual, 4th edition, page 20]. Definition of innovation in the 2017 SIBS: An innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service) or process, a new marketing method, or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization or external relations [Source: Oslo Manual, 3rd edition, page 46]. Small businesses: Interchangeable with small enterprises. These firms have between 20 to 99 employees. Large businesses: Interchangeable with large enterprises. These firms have 250 or more employees. Good or service innovation: New or improved good or service that differs significantly from the enterprise's previous goods or services with respect to its characteristics, functions or performance specifications and that has been introduced on the market. Business process innovation: New or improved process for one or more business activities or functions that differs significantly from this business's previous business processes and that has been brought into use by this business in its internal or outward-facing operations. Atlantic region: Includes Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Rest of Canada: Includes Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Benefits from production through efficient use of resources: (1) Improved resource efficiency through reduced material use per unit of output; (2) improved resource efficiency through reduced energy use per unit of output; (3) improved resource efficiency by replacing material with less greenhouse-gas-intensive alternatives; (4) reduced consumption of resources through recycling (water, waste or material); and (5) renewable fuels: ethanol, biodiesel, biogas, biochar and hydrogen. Benefits related to increased environmental protection activities: (1) Reduced air, water, soil or noise pollution; and (2) reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Benefits related to consumer or end user: (1) Reduced energy use or increased energy efficiency for the consumer or end user; (2) reduced material use or increased recycling for the consumer or end user; (3) reduced air, water, soil or noise pollution for the consumer or end user; and (4) reduced greenhouse gas emissions for the consumer or end user.

February Employment Insurance (EI) statistics reflect labour market conditions as of the week of February 14 to 20. Ahead of the February reference week, non-essential businesses, cultural and recreation facilities, and in-person dining reopened in many provinces, subject to capacity limits and various other public health requirements. Public health measures were relaxed in Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on February 8, although a curfew remained in effect in Quebec. Measures were loosened in many regions of Ontario on February 10 and 15, although stay-at-home orders remained in place in the health regions of Toronto, Peel, York and North Bay Parry Sound. In Manitoba, various measures were eased on February 12. In contrast, Newfoundland and Labrador reintroduced a lockdown on February 12, requiring the widespread closure of non-essential businesses and services. Number of regular EI beneficiaries up in February The number of Canadians receiving regular EI benefits rose 3.6% (+53,000) to 1.5 million in February, following an 11.2% increase in January. Results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicate that employment increased 259,000 in February, following two months of losses, while unemployment fell to 1.7 million, including 1.4 million who were looking for work and 300,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Infographic 1 Regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries up in February Female youth more likely than other age groups to qualify for regular EI under the new rules In September 2020, temporary changes to EI eligibility criteria were introduced to support workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In February, 14.2% of regular EI recipients—including almost one-quarter (23.0%) of those aged 15 to 24—qualified under these new eligibility criteria. Chart 1 Proportion of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules in February, by age group and sex (not seasonally adjusted) Number of regular EI beneficiaries increases in seven provinces The number of regular EI beneficiaries rose in seven provinces in February, led by Ontario (+35,000; +6.3%), British Columbia (+18,000; +13.2%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (+10,000; +22.0%). Almost three-quarters of the increase observed in Ontario was attributable to regular EI beneficiaries who also worked at some point during the reference week, reflecting the loosening of public health measures in the province during that week. Reflecting the reintroduction of strict public health measures in Newfoundland and Labrador, almost one in four individuals (22.6%) in the labour force in that province received regular EI benefits in February. The increase observed in Newfoundland and Labrador was almost entirely driven by EI beneficiaries who did not work during the reference week. At the same time, Quebec (-18,000; -4.8%), Alberta (-2,000; -1.0%) and Manitoba (-1,000; -1.4%) posted decreases in the number of regular EI recipients. On a regional basis, census metropolitan areas (CMAs) (+29,000; +2.8%) recorded the largest increase in regular EI recipients, followed by regions outside CMAs and census agglomerations (+15,000; +5.9%). Industries most impacted by public health measures account for over one-third of regular EI recipients According to February LFS results, employment remained below pre-COVID-19 levels in the industries most impacted by public health measures, including accommodation and food services (-26.1%); information, culture and recreation (-15.1%); other services (-6.0%); and retail trade (-5.4%). The profile of regular EI recipients further illustrates the impact of pandemic response measures on these same industries. In February, more than one-third (38.7%) of all regular EI recipients last worked in one of these four industries, compared with 19.4% one year previously (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Industries most impacted by public health measures account for over one-third of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries (not seasonally adjusted) Young women particularly hard hit by public health measures In February, women accounted for a larger proportion of regular EI recipients in all age groups, compared with one year previously. The increase among female youth aged 15 to 24 years, who accounted for 44.9% of all youth regular EI beneficiaries, compared with 29.9% in February 2020, was particularly notable. Results from the February LFS show that year-over-year employment losses among young women were almost double those among young men, indicating that young women have been particularly hard hit by pandemic-related public health measures. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit). Concepts and methodology The analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March 2020 to February 2021 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The number of regular EI beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from February 14 to 20. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals who qualified for EI only as a result of these program changes. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. EI beneficiaries by number of months on EI or Canada Emergency Response Benefit over the last year This supplementary indicator presents the number of regular EI recipients who received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for a defined number of total months over the last 12 months. A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – Definitions for more information. Data availability Data tables 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337 remain suspended as of the December 2019 reference period, because of occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is ongoing to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. Data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008 remain suspended as of the March 2020 reference period, because a source data file contains records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. In the data table 14-10-0009, for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed because of data quality. Next release Data on EI for March 2021 will be released on May 20, 2021.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.2% on a year-over-year basis in March, up from a 1.1% gain in February. A significant proportion of this increase was attributable to a steep decline in prices in March 2020, as the monthly CPI rose 0.5% in March 2021. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.1% in March. Excluding energy, the CPI rose 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. As Canada marked the end of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, price growth in March 2021 was accentuated by what is known as base-year effects, originating in March 2020. The broad decline in prices in spring 2020, when headline CPI growth slowed to 0.9% in March 2020, had an upward impact on consumer inflation in March 2021. As the upward impact of these temporary base-year effects will influence the 12-month movement over the next few months, the historical movements affecting current growth trends will be examined. Base-year effects and the CPI: The COVID-19 experience The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a standard measure of the price of a representative basket of goods and services. The headline consumer inflation is measured as the percentage change between the CPI in the current month (March 2021) and the CPI in a base month or the same calendar month of the previous year (March 2020). A base-year effect refers to the impact that price movements from 12 months earlier have on the current month's headline consumer inflation. When a large downward price change in the base month stops influencing—or falls out of—the 12-month price movement, this has an upward effect on the headline CPI in the current month. Conversely, a large upward price change in the base month creates downward pressure on the current month's measure. In spring 2020, the global economy was dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Canadian consumers experienced a significant decline in prices from February to April 2020. Headline consumer inflation slowed from +2.2% in February 2020 to +0.9% in March and -0.2% in April, the largest two-month slowdown in year-over-year CPI growth since 1992. The broad decline in prices at the onset of the pandemic, led by prices for energy products and travel services, had an upward impact on the year-over-year rate of consumer inflation in March 2021 because significantly lower prices from March 2020 were used as the basis for year-over-year comparisons. For instance, gasoline prices were 35.3% higher in March 2021 compared with March 2020, when prices reached a four-year low in the early weeks of the pandemic. The upward impact of these base-year effects will be temporary. In the coming months, the price declines observed in March and April 2020 will fall out of the 12-month price movement. Users should consider the impact of base-year effects when interpreting the 12-month price movement in the coming months. Chart 1 The 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding energy Chart 2 Energy prices rise in March Highlights Year over year, consumer price growth increased within a context of rising consumer confidence and improving employment conditions as COVID-19 restrictions eased in many regions of the country. In March, prices rose in five of the eight major components year over year, with transportation (+7.1%) and shelter (+2.4%) prices contributing the most to CPI growth. Compared with March 2020, consumers paid less for clothing and footwear (-5.4%) and for household operations, furnishings and equipment (-0.2%). Chart 3 Prices rise in five of eight major components Energy prices rise on higher demand and lower supply Gasoline prices led the increase in consumer energy prices, rising 35.3% year over year in March, the largest gain in gasoline prices since March 2000. The price increase was mainly driven by growing global oil demand, as well as the continuation of production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus. Lower prices for gasoline in March 2020 also contributed to the year-over-year increase in March 2021 as a result of the base-year effect. Crude oil prices fell significantly at this time in the previous year as demand for oil dropped because of COVID-19 lockdown measures, leaving an oversupply in the market. As this historical year-over-year decrease ceased to impact the 12-month movement, an additional temporary upward effect influenced the pace of the year-over-year increase in the gasoline index this March. Infographic 1 Gasoline prices rise in March Similarly, prices for natural gas (+14.1%) and fuel oil and other fuels (+7.7%) increased year over year in March. Homeowners' replacement costs push shelter prices higher Shelter prices rose 2.4% on a year-over-year basis in March. As costs for building materials and demand for single-family homes continued to grow, the homeowners' replacement cost index, linked to new home prices, increased 7.9% year over year. The rise in the homeowners' replacement cost index, which comprises about 5% of the CPI basket weight, was partially offset by a drop in the mortgage interest cost index. The mortgage interest cost index, which makes up about 4% of the CPI basket weight, fell 6.3% year over year. Chart 4 Yearly price changes in mortgage interest cost and homeowners' replacement cost Consumers pay more for eggs and dairy products in March Year-over-year growth in the food purchased from stores index remained steady at 1.3% in March, the same increase reported in February. Consumers paid 11.4% more for eggs year over year and 2.4% more for dairy products. Although these products contributed the most to the increase in prices of food purchased from stores, the increase was mainly attributable to lower prices in March 2020. During the early days of the pandemic, demand for eggs plummeted, with the closure of restaurants and other food services causing a surplus in the market. By contrast, prices for fresh or frozen beef fell 2.1% year over year in March, following a 0.3% gain in February, because of increased supply. Regional highlights Year over year, prices rose at a faster pace in March than in February in every province, primarily because of higher gasoline prices. Chart 5 The Consumer Price Index rises at a faster pace in every province Energy prices rise in Alberta and Ontario In Alberta, prices for natural gas were up 35.6% compared with March 2020, when prices declined because of lower demand during the early stages of the pandemic. Electricity prices in Ontario were up 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. On January 1, 2021, following a province-wide lockdown to reduce COVID-19 infections, the provincial government set all time-of-use electricity prices to the off-peak rate. This fixed pricing ended on February 22, 2021, resulting in higher prices for on-peak and mid-peak electricity consumption. Rent prices increase in Atlantic Canada Rent prices rose in all four Atlantic provinces year over year in March: New Brunswick (+4.8%), Prince Edward Island (+2.9%), Newfoundland and Labrador (+2.2%), and Nova Scotia (+2.0%). Higher demand as a result of increased migration and fewer homes for sale contributed to the increase.

Goods and services in the CPI that were not available to consumers in March because of COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, effectively removing their impact on the monthly CPI. The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the all-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, personal care services in some areas, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. The price indexes for beer served in licensed establishments, wine served in licensed establishments and liquor served in licensed establishments were imputed in several regions, using the indexes to which consumers likely redirected their expenditures: beer purchased from stores, wine purchased from stores and liquor purchased from stores. Consistent with previous months affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for suspended flights are excluded from the March CPI calculation because passengers were ultimately unable to consume them. As a result, selected sub-components of the air transportation index were imputed from the parent index (air transportation). Detailed documentation is available in the ""Technical Supplement for the March 2021 Consumer Price Index,"" within the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M). It provides further details on the imputations used to compile the March 2021 CPI. Explore the Consumer Price Index Check out the Personal Inflation Calculator!

For more recent information on the sale of alcoholic beverages, the monthly release of retail trade sales by province and territory (table 20-10-0008-01) on May 21, 2021 will contain total sales by beer, wine and liquor stores for the March 2021 reference period. Canadians over the legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 9.5 standard alcoholic beverages a week in 2019/2020, totalling 3,084 million litres. This was down 0.3% from a year earlier and the first decrease in volume in six years. Beer remained the alcoholic beverage of choice for Canadians, but it continued to lose market share to wine, spirits and ciders and coolers. Retail sales data show that alcohol sales for March 2020 were up 17.5% from the previous month and up 19.2% compared with sales in March 2019. Liquor authorities confirmed this surge in sales. Many of them reported that their customers were stockpiling alcohol in the last two weeks of March 2020 because of the uncertainty about potential closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail sales data also show an increase in alcohol sales for the 10-month period from April 2020 to January 2021. If this trend continues, sales for the year ending March 2021—the first full year of alcohol sales that reflect pandemic-related purchasing habits—will have increased significantly from the year before. Chart 1 Sale of standard drinks per week per person over the legal drinking age, 2019/2020 Total beer sales by liquor stores, agencies and other retail outlets fell 1.9% to $9.2 billion during the fiscal year 2019/2020—the largest sales decline since 1994 and the first decrease in six years. Wine sales rebounded from their slow growth a year earlier (+0.2%), rising 5.2% to $7.8 billion in 2019/2020. Sales of spirits grew 6.0% to $6.0 billion. Cider and cooler sales rose at the fastest pace among all alcohol types for the eighth straight year, up 17.2% to $1.3 billion in 2019/2020. While beer remained the alcoholic beverage of choice for Canadians in 2019/2020, accounting for 37.8% of total alcohol sales, it lost 1.9% of its market share to wine (+0.6% to 32.2%), spirits (+0.7% to 24.6%) and ciders and coolers (+0.6% to 5.4%). Chart 2 Market share by type of beverage and year, 2004/2005 to 2019/2020 Overall, $24.4 billion worth of alcoholic beverages were sold in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, up 3.1% from a year earlier. Net income and other government revenue derived from the control and sale of alcoholic beverages, including excise taxes, retail sales taxes, specific taxes on alcohol, and licence and permit revenues, increased 3.1% to $12.8 billion. Beer sales per person hits new low Beer sales fell 1.9% to $9.2 billion in 2019/2020. Residents of Nunavut were most likely to buy beer (66.8% of total sales), while those in British Columbia (31.4%) were the least likely to do so. By volume, beer sales declined by 3.2% to 2 139 million litres or 71.1 litres of beer per person over the legal drinking age. This was the lowest per person volume ever reported for beer sales since Statistics Canada began tracking alcohol sales in 1950. Chart 3 Beer sales by volume, per person over the legal drinking age, 1949/1950 to 2019/2020 Canadians over the legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 4.0 standard bottles of beer a week in 2019/2020 (see Note to readers). Wine sales continue to grow Wine sales rose 5.2% to $7.8 billion in 2019/2020 – the largest increase in eight years. While beer was the alcoholic beverage of choice across much of Canada last year, wine claimed the top spot in Quebec (45.1% of total sales) and British Columbia (34.3%). Residents of Saskatchewan (15.2%) were least likely to buy wine. Chart 4 Market share of alcohol by type and geography, 2019/2020 Red was the wine of choice for just over half of Canadians (53.2%), followed by white (33.5%), sparkling (6.4%) and rosé, fortified and other wines (7.0%). Canadians of legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 2.5 glasses of wine in 2019/2020. By volume, wine sales increased by 4.1% to 527 million litres. Spirit sales rise Spirit sales rose 6.0% from a year earlier to $6.0 billion during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. Spirits were the biggest seller in the Northwest Territories (42.7% of total sales) and accounted for the smallest share in neighbouring Nunavut (9.8%). Overall, sales of Canadian spirits increased by 5.9% while imported spirit sales rose 6.1%. Nationally, whisky (29.9%), vodka (25.0%) and rum (15.1%) were the most popular spirits sold in Canada in 2019/2020, accounting for over two-thirds (70.0%) of total spirit sales. Chart 5 Market share of spirits by type and geography, 2019/2020 Canadians over the legal drinking age bought the equivalent of 2.5 shots of spirits per week in 2019/2020. By volume, spirits sold increased 4.0% to 181.3 million litres. Among spirits, gin sales have grown at the fastest pace over the past decade, rising by almost two-thirds (+63.3%) from 2009/2010 to 2019/2020. Ciders, coolers and other refreshment beverages remains the fastest growing alcoholic beverage Canadians bought $1.3 billion worth of ciders and coolers in 2019/2020, up 17.2% from the previous fiscal year. Residents of Yukon (9.8% of total sales) were most likely to buy ciders and coolers while those in Quebec (1.4%) were the least likely to do so. In terms of volume, 236.9 million litres of ciders and coolers were sold in 2019/2020, up 15.6% from the previous fiscal year. Spirit cooler sales have more than doubled over the past decade. Since 2009/2010, the volume of sales rose by 166.3%. Note to readers Comparability and limitations of data Data on sales of alcoholic beverages by volume should not be equated with data on consumption of alcoholic beverages. Sales volumes only include sales as reported by the liquor authorities and their agencies, including sales by wineries, breweries and other outlets that operate under license from the liquor authorities. Statistics on sales of alcoholic beverages by dollar value should not be equated with consumer expenditures on alcoholic beverages. The sales data refer to the revenues received by liquor authorities and their agents, and a portion of these revenues include sales to licensed establishments such as bars and restaurants, some of which would be considered as business intermediate expenses. The value of sales of alcoholic beverages excludes all sales taxes, the value of returnable containers, and deposits. Absolute volume of sales of alcoholic beverages is calculated by multiplying the sales volume by the percentage of alcohol content for each product category. Standard drink According to Health Canada guidelines, a standard drink is defined as a 341 mL (12 oz.) beer, cooler, or cider with 5% alcohol content, a 142 mL (5 oz.) glass of wine with 12% alcohol content, or a 43 mL (1.5 oz.) spirit drink with 40% alcohol. Legal drinking age versus per capita Standard drinks per week per person are calculated for each person over the legal drinking age in Canada. The legal drinking age is 19 years and older in every province and territory except Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta, where it is 18 years and older. Per capita sales by value and volume are based on the population of inhabitants aged 15 years and older. This allows comparability with other countries, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Health Organization as they also present alcohol-per-capita data using the population of inhabitants aged 15 years and older.

March 2021 marked the third consecutive month of record-setting numbers as building permits rose 5.7% to $10.9 billion, reflecting a booming residential sector. Constant dollar estimates are available, for the first time, for the building-permit series dating back to 2011. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits increased by 4.0% to $8.1 billion, a number only surpassed by the April 2019 value of $8.2 billion. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, March 2021 Residential sector surges to new heights The residential sector climbed 15.9%, clearing the $8.0 billion mark for the first time in March. Multi-family dwellings jumped 24.5% compared with February to an unprecedented $4.3 billion. This gain resulted largely from permits being issued for residential towers in the cities of Toronto, Burlington, and Vaughan. Single-family homes also reached new heights, increasing 7.6% to $3.8 billion. The census metropolitan area of Oshawa was responsible for just over one-third of this growth. Chart 2 Month-to-month change in the value of non-residential building permits Chart 3 Month-to-month change in the value of residential building permits Chart 4 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Declines in institutional and commercial components bring down the non-residential sector Following a month in which several major permits were issued for care facilities, institutional permits fell 33.5% to $732.1 million. Eight provinces posted a decline in this component, with Quebec (-54.5%) recording the most significant drop. Commercial permits decreased 14.6% to $1.5 billion, about 25% lower than the average monthly value reported in 2019. After declining slightly in the first two months of 2020, commercial permits took a large hit at the start of the pandemic, and have since averaged around the $1.5 billion mark observed in March. Industrial permits, the only component to report a gain in the non-residential sector, rose 16.4% to $650.5 million. Several major permits were issued, including a new relay control centre for railroads in the city of Montréal and the Rutherford Station of the Go Transit system in the city of Vaughan. Overall, the non-residential sector fell 15.6% to $2.8 billion. Big start to 2021 leads to another record-setting quarter Three consecutive monthly highs led to a record-setting first quarter, up 12.7% to $31.2 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Gains were reported in all components. On a constant dollar basis, the first quarter of 2021 posted the largest value since the start of the series in 2011 ($23.3 billion), beating out the previous record of $22.3 billion in the second quarter of 2019. The first three months of 2021 were the highest posted in the residential sector (+15.0%). Single-family homes (+22.8%) showed stronger quarterly growth than multi-family dwellings (+8.3%) and both reached new heights by breaking previous records set in the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite rising 7.5% in the first quarter to $9.1 billion, construction intentions for non-residential buildings have not fully recovered from the effects of the pandemic, remaining well below the peak of $10.6 billion set in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates have been made available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous two months have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous three months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for April will be released on June 2.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.4% in February, following 0.7% growth in January. This 10th consecutive monthly increase continued to offset the steepest drops on record in Canadian economic activity observed in March and April 2020. However, total economic activity was about 2% below the level observed in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product grows in February Services-producing industries were up 0.6%, while goods-producing industries contracted (-0.2%) for the first time since April. Overall, 14 of the 20 industrial sectors expanded in February. Preliminary information indicates an approximate 0.9% increase in real GDP for March. Manufacturing, retail trade, and finance and insurance contributed to the gain, while mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction offset some of the growth. This advance estimate points to an approximate 1.6% increase in real GDP in the first quarter of 2021. Owing to their preliminary nature, these estimates will be revised on June 1 with the release of the official GDP data for the March reference month and the first quarter of 2021. Retail trade rebounds Retail trade activity jumped 4.5% in February, following two months of decreases, as 10 of the 12 subsectors were up. In February, many provinces lifted or eased the lockdown measures that had largely contributed to the sector's declines in December and January. Stores more dependent on in-store traffic experienced the largest rebound in activity. Chart 2 Retail trade grows in February Clothing and clothing accessories stores (+23.5%), sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+28.8%), and furniture and home furnishings stores (+11.7%) saw double-digit increases in activity. Motor vehicle and parts dealers were also up strongly (+4.9%), led by higher activity at new car dealers and at automotive parts, accessories and tire stores. General merchandise stores grew 6.0%, while building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers were up 3.5%, benefiting from continued growth in home alteration and improvement activity. Non-store retailers increased for the fourth month in a row, growing 0.5% in February. Construction grows Construction rose 2.0% in February, building on increases in the previous two months, as all subsectors were up. Residential building construction jumped 4.7% as all types of construction recorded growth, led by home alterations and improvements and by single-family home construction. Repair (+0.5%), engineering and other construction activities (+0.2%), and non-residential building construction (+0.3%) were all up in February. First decline in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction in six months Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction declined 2.8% in February as two of the three subsectors contracted. Oil and gas extraction decreased 3.9% in February following five consecutive months of growth. Oil sands extraction (-4.8%) was down for the first time in six months as lower crude bitumen and synthetic oil production in Alberta contributed to the decline in February. Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) decreased 2.8% as crude petroleum extraction was down across the country, with notable declines at Newfoundland and Labrador offshore production facilities. Following three months of growth, mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) declined 2.7% in February as all subsectors were down. Metal ore mining decreased 3.1%, as copper, nickel, lead and zinc ore mining (-6.4%), iron ore mining (-1.9%), and other metal ore mining (-16.8%) all contributed to the decline. International demand for these commodities was down in February. In contrast, support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction grew 3.5% in February, led by higher drilling and rigging services. Manufacturing contracts The manufacturing sector contracted 0.9% in February, following 1.5% growth in January, continuing the sequence of increases alternating with small declines seen since September 2020. Both durable and non-durable manufacturing were down in February. Durable manufacturing decreased 0.9% in February, following 2.2% growth in January, on declines largely concentrated in transportation equipment. The transportation equipment manufacturing subsector declined 4.2% as a global semiconductor shortage contributed to production disruptions in motor vehicle (-5.2%) and motor vehicle parts (-11.0%) manufacturing. Non-durable manufacturing decreased 1.0% in February as four of the nine subsectors were down. Contributing the most to the decline was plastics and rubber products manufacturing (-6.6%), as lower demand from motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts manufacturers partially contributed to the decrease. Food manufacturing was down 1.7%, with meat product manufacturing (-9.7%) contributing the most to the decline, as a number of processing plants dealt with temporary closures because of COVID-19. Printing and related support activities (+8.7%), beverage and tobacco product manufacturing (+2.2%), and chemical manufacturing (+0.3%) offset some of the decrease. Professional services keep growing Professional services expanded 1.2% in February as all industries were up. Contributing the most to the gains were computer systems design and related services (+1.2%) and other professional, scientific and technical services, including scientific research and development (+1.2%). Legal services, which derive much of their activity from real estate transactions, grew 1.6% in February. An increase in home resale activity in and around the Greater Toronto Area and continued strength in Western Canadian centres pushed the level of activity at offices of real estate agents and brokers (+3.4%) to yet another all-time high. The public sector continues to grow The public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) grew 0.6% in February, as all three components were up. Health care and social assistance rose 1.1%, led by ambulatory health care services (+2.5%). The educational services sector was up 0.5%, as elementary and secondary schools, along with universities, increased. Public administration grew 0.1% as a decline in municipal government services was more than offset by increases in federal and provincial and territorial government services. Other industries Accommodation and food services grew 3.5% in February, following five consecutive months of decline. Growth was led by a 4.0% increase in food services and drinking places, which benefited from eased restrictions across many provinces. Transportation declined 2.0% as a majority of industries were down. Support activities for transportation (-4.5%), air transportation (-35.3%) and rail transportation (-3.8%) contributed the most to the decline. Transit, ground passenger, and scenic and sightseeing transportation (+8.0%), pipeline transportation (+0.6%), and warehousing and storage (+0.8%) were up. Wholesale trade declined 1.0% in February, partly offsetting a 3.7% increase in January, as six of the nine subsectors were down. Contributing the most to the decrease in February were building material and supplies wholesaling (-6.8%) and machinery, equipment and supplies wholesaling (-0.7%), which had strong increases the month before. Miscellaneous wholesaling (+3.1%) and personal and household goods wholesaling (+1.1%) offset some of the declines. Finance and insurance grew 0.4%, as credit intermediation and monetary authorities (+0.2%), financial investment services, funds and other financial vehicles (+0.9%), and insurance carriers and related activities (+0.4%) rose. Utilities grew 1.3% in February, as electric power generation, transmission and distribution (+1.1%), natural gas distribution (+2.9%), and water, sewage and other systems (+0.9%) all increased. Chart 3 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product Table 1 Monthly gross domestic product by industry at basic prices in chained (2012) dollars – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The release on gross domestic product by industry is an example of how Statistics Canada supports global sustainable development goal reporting. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Monthly data on gross domestic product (GDP) by industry at basic prices are chained volume estimates with 2012 as the reference year. This means that the data for each industry and each aggregate are obtained from a chained volume index multiplied by the industry's value added in 2012. The monthly data are benchmarked to annually chained Fisher volume indexes of GDP obtained from the constant-price supply and use tables (SUTs) up to the latest SUT year (2017). For the period starting in January 2018, data are derived by chaining a fixed-weight Laspeyres volume index to the prior period. The fixed weights are 2017 industry prices. This approach makes the monthly GDP by industry data more comparable with expenditure-based GDP data, which are chained quarterly. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. An advance estimate of industrial production for March 2021 is available upon request. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Revisions With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions have been made back to January 2020. Each month, newly available administrative and survey data from various industries in the economy are integrated, resulting in statistical revisions. Updated and revised administrative data (including taxation statistics), new information provided by respondents to industry surveys, and standard changes to seasonal adjustment calculations are incorporated with each release. Real-time table Real-time table 36-10-0491-01 will be updated on May 10, 2021. Next release Data on GDP by industry for March 2021 will be released on June 1, 2021.

February data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are now available. The SEPH provides an account of payroll employment—that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits during a given month—as well as earnings and hours worked. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which provides an account of the number of people working during a specific week in the month, data from the SEPH and the JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions in Canada. Payroll employment increases in February The number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer—measured in the SEPH as payroll employment—increased by 43,400 (+0.3%) in February. This followed a notable decline in January, when employment losses associated with the tightening of public health restrictions were recorded by both the SEPH and the LFS. The February increase in SEPH payroll employment was smaller than the LFS employment increase (+259,000; +1.4%), partly because of lags in new or returning employees receiving their first paycheques. The largest increases in payroll employment were in Quebec (+27,200; +0.8%), Alberta (+19,600; +1.1%) and British Columbia (+9,400; +0.4%). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Ontario (-20,800; -0.3%), where public health restrictions remained in place for Toronto, Peel and North Bay Parry Sound throughout the month. Consistent with the February LFS results, the largest increases were in the accommodation and food services (+14,700; +1.7%) and retail trade (+13,300; +0.7%) sectors. The total number of payroll employees in February was down 1.2 million (-6.8%) from one year earlier, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in February after dip in January Average weekly earnings up in February Average weekly earnings were $1,140 in February, up 0.7% compared with January and 9.0% compared with one year earlier. Year-over-year earnings growth reflects a number of factors, including the changes over the period in the number of hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees, compared with salaried employees. In February, the number of hourly paid employees was 9.2% below its pre-COVID-19 level, compared with a gap of 4.3% for salaried employees. Average hours worked increase for hourly paid employees Average hours worked per week for hourly paid employees were 32.0 in February, 4.2% higher than one year earlier, as the remaining hourly employees worked more hours on average. In comparison, the average hours worked per week for salaried employees were 37.0, up 0.5% from one year earlier. Payroll employment increases in services-producing sector as public health measures ease in many provinces Payroll employment increases in the services-producing sector (+64,000; +0.5%) were partially offset by a decline in the goods-producing sector (-13,200; -0.5%) in February. The largest month-over-month payroll employment increases in February were in accommodation and food services (+14,700; +1.7%) and retail trade (+13,300; +0.7%), likely the result of public health measures being eased in many jurisdictions. Despite these increases, these two sectors remained two of the furthest from pre-COVID-19 February 2020 levels, with payroll employment down 32.5% year over year in accommodation and food services and 7.0% in retail trade. Within retail trade, year-over-year employment changes varied by subsector. Payroll employment in clothing and clothing accessories stores was 32.2% lower than one year earlier, while in general merchandise stores, it was 5.4% higher. In February, these two sectors also continued to have the lowest average weekly earnings, at $459 in accommodation and food services and $642 in retail trade, despite year-over-year earnings growth of 6.9% and 2.5%, respectively. Upward trends continue for payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services, and health care and social assistance In February, payroll employment rose by 9,600 (+1.0%) in professional, scientific and technical services, one of the sectors least affected by public health measures. Most of the monthly growth was in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, with increases spread across several industries. Employment in the sector was up 1.5% compared with its pre-COVID-19 February 2020 level. In health care and social assistance, payroll employment rose for a ninth consecutive month, up 9,100 (+0.4%) in February. This month-over-month rise was driven by increases in hospitals and in ambulatory health care services. Payroll employment in the sector was 0.7% above its pre-COVID-19 February 2020 level. Payroll employment down in administrative and support services, and in arts, entertainment and recreation Payroll employment declined in the administrative and support services (-10,500; -1.3%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (-3,600; -1.9%) sectors in February. The February decline in administrative and support services was the first since May, and it was largely in employment services (which include employment placement agencies) and services to buildings and dwellings. Despite trending up in recent months, payroll employment in administrative and support services has not yet returned to its pre-COVID-19 February 2020 level, with employment in February 2021 down 7.4% year over year. In arts, entertainment and recreation—the sector furthest below its pre-pandemic employment level (-41.0%)—the February 2021 decline was driven by other amusement and recreation industries (which include, for example, recreational, sport and fitness centres and bowling centres). Job vacancies in health care and social assistance hit new record high In February, health care and social assistance had more job vacancies (112,800, not seasonally adjusted) than any other sector for the fourth consecutive month. Vacancies in this sector represented more than one-fifth of all vacancies in Canada. The job vacancy rate, which represents vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied), was 5.2% in health care and social assistance in February, the highest vacancy rate of all sectors. This was the highest job vacancy rate for this sector since monthly job vacancy estimates became available in October 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the quarterly job vacancy rate for this sector ranged from 3.0% to 3.3% from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. Following a decline during the first wave of COVID-19, payroll employment in health care and social assistance has been trending upward, surpassing its pre-COVID-19 level in December 2020. The high level of vacancies and the high job vacancy rate indicate that, despite this increase in employment, employers in health care and social assistance continued to face staffing challenges as they addressed the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 505,900 positions in February (not seasonally adjusted), corresponding to a job vacancy rate of 3.3%. This follows rates between 3.0% and 3.9% from October 2020 to January 2021. British Columbia (4.9%) and Quebec (3.6%) continued to have the highest job vacancy rates among the provinces (not seasonally adjusted). Looking ahead March SEPH data—to be released on May 27—will provide detailed information on sectors and subsectors that may have benefited from the further loosening of COVID-19 public health measures that month. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. Payroll employment, as measured by the SEPH, refers to the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and the LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and the SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupation for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wages and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period.

Retail sales — Nvt. $46.0 millions February 2021 -2.4% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 20-10-0008-01. Retail sales were up 4.8% to $55.1 billion in February. Sales increased in 9 of 11 subsectors, led by higher sales at motor-vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor-vehicle and parts dealers—rose for the first time in three months, increasing 3.8% in February on higher sales at general merchandise stores and at clothing and clothing accessories stores. In volume terms, retail sales increased 4.3% in February. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public-health measures in several regions across the country that directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, approximately 12% of retailers were closed during February. The average length of the shutdown was two business days. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued cooperation. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales increased 2.3% in March. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 65% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 90.4%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in February Sales at motor-vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations post consecutive gains Sales at motor-vehicle and parts dealers increased for the second consecutive month, rising 5.0% in February. The increase was mostly because of higher sales at new car dealers (+5.6%) and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (+9.2%), some of which were closed in January as a result of lockdowns in select regions. In contrast, sales at other motor vehicle dealers contracted 2.3% in February. Sales at gasoline stations also increased for the second month in a row, rising 12.3% in February—their largest increase since June 2020. Contributing to the increase were higher gasoline prices, which were up on a month-over-month basis. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations rose 6.8% following four consecutive declines. Core retail sales up on higher sales at general merchandise stores and non-essential retailers After two consecutive months of declines, core retail sales increased 3.8% in February, led by higher sales at general merchandise stores (+6.1%). Clothing and clothing accessories stores also contributed to the increase in core retail, rising 23.7% in February—its first gain since September 2020. Sales were up in all three subcategories, coinciding with the easing of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on non-essential retailers and malls in many parts of the country. In February, approximately 39% of clothing and clothing accessories stores reported having been closed for an average of 6 days, compared with 48% of those retailers who reported closures for an average of 13 days in January. On the heels of two consecutive declines, sales increased at furniture and home furnishings stores (+18.0%) and sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+23.5%) in February. In contrast, sales at food and beverage stores were down 1.4% in February. The decrease was mostly driven by lower sales at specialty food stores (-12.7%). Chart 2 Sales up in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales up in six provinces Sales were up in six provinces in February, with Quebec and Ontario leading the gain. In Quebec, sales rose by almost one-fifth in February (+19.0%)—their largest increase since June 2020. Motor-vehicle and parts dealers in the province reported higher sales, leading the gain amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in February. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montréal, sales were up 20.4%. In Ontario, sales rose 2.3% on increased sales at gasoline stations and at clothing and clothing accessories stores. Sales fell 1.9% in the CMA of Toronto, coinciding with the continuation of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in the region. Retail e-commerce in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 92.0% year over year to $3.1 billion in February, accounting for 6.8% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce out of total retail sales was 1.3 percentage points lower in February, as more brick-and-mortar stores were allowed to open their doors to in-person shopping. On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 5.7% in February. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers With this release, unadjusted monthly data were revised back to January 2020, while seasonally adjusted data (including retail e-commerce) were revised back to January 2017. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of respondent information, the correction of information in the data provided, the replacement of estimated figures with actual values (once available), the re-classification of companies within, into, and out of the retail trade sector, and updates to seasonal factors. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally-adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally-adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis-store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis-store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see Retail E-Commerce in Canada. Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes. Real-time tables Real-time tables 20-10-0054-01 and 20-10-0079-01 will be updated soon. Next release Data on retail trade for March will be released on May 21.

Total investment in building construction increased 5.9% to $18.6 billion in March, led by the residential sector. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction was up 5.2% to $14.3 billion in March. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Residential investment continues to set records Residential construction investment increased for the eleventh consecutive month, up 7.6% to $14.0 billion in March. Investment in single units jumped 10.7% to $7.8 billion. Quebec led the way with an increase of 30.4%, bringing investment in single homes to $1.9 billion for the province. Investment in Ontario was up 9.8% to $3.3 billion, driven by renovations to single family homes in the census metropolitan area of Toronto. Growth in multi-unit construction continued, up 3.9% to $6.2 billion. Gains in Quebec and Ontario led the overall increase in this component, as six provinces reported declines. Both new construction and renovations of condominiums and apartments in the cities of Toronto and Montréal accounted for most of the growth. Infographic 1 Investment in residential building construction, March 2021 Non-residential investment increases slightly Non-residential construction investment rose 1.1% to $4.6 billion in March, with all components posting slight increases. Despite this gain, the commercial and industrial investment components were below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Institutional construction investment was up 2.2% to $1.2 billion. Multiple high-value projects in Montréal contributed to a 2.6% increase in Quebec, where investment totalled $315 million in March. Investments in the province included a new elementary school in Laval and renovations to a secondary school in Montréal. British Columbia recorded another strong month in March, with the continued construction of new schools in Burnaby, North Vancouver and Vancouver. Commercial building construction rose 0.8% to $2.6 billion. Six provinces recorded slight gains, led by Ontario and Alberta. Large office building renovation projects in Edmonton and Calgary contributed to the 1.7% gain in Alberta in this component. Investment in industrial construction edged up 0.4% to $823 million in March. Increases in Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec offset six provincial declines. Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in non-residential building construction, March 2021 Residential investment drives first quarter of the year The total value of investment in building construction rose 9.3% to $53.1 billion in the first quarter, stemming from continued strength in the residential sector (+12.4%). Investment for residential buildings reached $39.5 billion, largely because of increased spending on single units in Ontario (+21.8%) and Quebec (+24.9%). Non-residential investment rose 1.1% to $13.6 billion in the first quarter, following a 6.0% decline in the previous quarter. Institutional construction advanced 3.0% in the first quarter, driven by strength in British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador, which recorded their highest levels for this component since the start of the series in 2010. Nova Scotia jumped 55.0%, reporting the highest quarterly value since the third quarter of 2014. Investment in commercial construction advanced slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, with the gain largely due to strength in Ontario. However, investment in this component was below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, down 13.8% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The industrial component edged down 0.2%, largely as a result of declines in Alberta. For more information on housing, please visit the Housing Statistics Portal. Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. As per Statistics Canada practices, data for the previous year have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous three years have also been revised. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted with current dollar values unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates in constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (Table 18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to the structure type ""single."" Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage. Effective November 23, 2018, Table 34-10-0175-01 contains data on both the residential and the non-residential sectors. It replaced tables 34-10-0010-01, 34-10-0011-01 and 34-10-0012-01. Next release Data on investment in building construction for April will be released on June 10.

March 2021 marked the third consecutive month of record-setting numbers as building permits rose 5.7% to $10.9 billion, reflecting a booming residential sector. Constant dollar estimates are available, for the first time, for the building-permit series dating back to 2011. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits increased by 4.0% to $8.1 billion, a number only surpassed by the April 2019 value of $8.2 billion. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, March 2021 Residential sector surges to new heights The residential sector climbed 15.9%, clearing the $8.0 billion mark for the first time in March. Multi-family dwellings jumped 24.5% compared with February to an unprecedented $4.3 billion. This gain resulted largely from permits being issued for residential towers in the cities of Toronto, Burlington, and Vaughan. Single-family homes also reached new heights, increasing 7.6% to $3.8 billion. The census metropolitan area of Oshawa was responsible for just over one-third of this growth. Chart 2 Month-to-month change in the value of non-residential building permits Chart 3 Month-to-month change in the value of residential building permits Chart 4 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Declines in institutional and commercial components bring down the non-residential sector Following a month in which several major permits were issued for care facilities, institutional permits fell 33.5% to $732.1 million. Eight provinces posted a decline in this component, with Quebec (-54.5%) recording the most significant drop. Commercial permits decreased 14.6% to $1.5 billion, about 25% lower than the average monthly value reported in 2019. After declining slightly in the first two months of 2020, commercial permits took a large hit at the start of the pandemic, and have since averaged around the $1.5 billion mark observed in March. Industrial permits, the only component to report a gain in the non-residential sector, rose 16.4% to $650.5 million. Several major permits were issued, including a new relay control centre for railroads in the city of Montréal and the Rutherford Station of the Go Transit system in the city of Vaughan. Overall, the non-residential sector fell 15.6% to $2.8 billion. Big start to 2021 leads to another record-setting quarter Three consecutive monthly highs led to a record-setting first quarter, up 12.7% to $31.2 billion compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Gains were reported in all components. On a constant dollar basis, the first quarter of 2021 posted the largest value since the start of the series in 2011 ($23.3 billion), beating out the previous record of $22.3 billion in the second quarter of 2019. The first three months of 2021 were the highest posted in the residential sector (+15.0%). Single-family homes (+22.8%) showed stronger quarterly growth than multi-family dwellings (+8.3%) and both reached new heights by breaking previous records set in the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite rising 7.5% in the first quarter to $9.1 billion, construction intentions for non-residential buildings have not fully recovered from the effects of the pandemic, remaining well below the peak of $10.6 billion set in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates have been made available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous two months have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous three months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series.

Retail sales were up 3.6% to $57.6 billion in March, led by higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and clothing and clothing accessories stores. Sales at food and beverage stores declined. Sales increased in 10 of 11 subsectors, representing 79.1% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude sales at gasoline stations, and motor vehicle and parts dealers—rose 4.7%. In volume terms, retail sales increased 3.2% in March. Retail sales were up 1.8% in the first quarter—the third consecutive quarterly increase. In volume terms, quarterly sales were up 0.5%. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, 2.1% of retailers were closed at some point in March. The average length of the closure was less than one day. This represented a widespread reopening of the economy between the second and third waves of the pandemic. In February, 12.0% of retailers were closed for an average of two days. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 5.1% in April. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 46% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 90.7%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in March Core retail sales rise as stores reopen Core retail sales rose for the second consecutive month, up 4.7% in March on higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+19.8%). This was the largest increase since May 2020 and coincided with warmer-than-typical March weather and the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in some areas of the country. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores rose for the second straight month, up 23.6% in March, to their highest level since the beginning of the pandemic. The increase in March is attributable to higher sales at clothing stores (+25.0%) and shoe stores (+42.8%). Sales at jewellery, luggage and leather goods stores edged down 0.1%. In March, 5.1% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of one day; in February, 38.8% were closed for an average of six days. The lone decline in March was at food and beverage stores (-1.3%), where sales decreased for the third time in four months on lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores (-1.6%) and specialty food stores (-12.0%). These declines were partially offset by higher sales at beer, wine and liquor stores (+3.1%). Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations rise for the third consecutive month Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased for the third consecutive month, up 1.4% in March. The growth is mostly attributable to higher sales at other motor vehicle dealers (+11.8%) and new car dealers (+0.7%). Sales at gasoline stations also increased for the third month in a row, rising 1.8% in March on higher gasoline prices. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations declined 0.8%. Chart 2 Sales up in 10 of 11 subsectors Sales up in six provinces Sales were up in six provinces in March, with Ontario accounting for the majority of the increase. In Ontario, sales rose 9.0% on higher sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores, and building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers. This was the largest monthly increase in Ontario since June 2020, when sales were up 32.3%. Sales rose 6.8% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, coinciding with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Quebec (+2.2%) posted the second-largest provincial increase, on higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and general merchandise stores. In the CMA of Montréal, sales were up 4.1%. Retail e-commerce in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 58.5% year over year to $3.7 billion in March, accounting for 6.3% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales fell 0.7 percentage points in March as more brick-and-mortar stores were allowed to open their doors to in-person shopping. On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 1.5% in March. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

This could have long-term ramifications for class of 2020 high school and postsecondary graduates as they enter the labour market. A new study presents estimates of the cumulative earnings losses in the first five years after graduation that this year's graduating class could experience, depending on the depth of the economic downturn. Specifically, five scenarios for this year's youth unemployment rate are examined in comparison with the long-term historical average of 14.3%: 16.0%, 19.0%, 22.0%, 25.0%, and 28.0%. Other factors may impact the earnings of graduates, but these are not considered in this study. Students belonging to this year's class of high school, college, and bachelor's degree graduates could lose from $23,000 to $44,000 over the next five years if this year's annual youth unemployment rate reaches 28.0%. This is equivalent to $4,600 to $8,800 per year. Although such losses are at least as large as the average debt load of postsecondary graduates, they are quite small compared with the estimated long-term benefits of graduating with a postsecondary qualification rather than a high school diploma based on an earlier Statistics Canada study. For example, mid-career university graduates generally earn about twice as much as their high school graduate counterparts, corresponding to a difference of roughly $40,000 in one year alone. If, instead, this year's youth unemployment rate reaches 19.0%, which is close to the historical high of 19.2% (set in 1983), earnings losses are likely to be far more moderate (from about $8,000 to $15,000 over the next five years, or about $1,600 to $3,000 per year). Under a scenario where the youth labour market recovers very quickly and the youth unemployment rate reaches 16.0% this year, five-year losses could amount to less than $6,000 for all groups, or less than $1,200 per year. Regardless of the scenario that actually unfolds, this year's female postsecondary graduates may incur larger earnings losses during the next five years than their male counterparts. For example, if this year's youth unemployment rate is 28.0%, female bachelor's degree graduates may lose $43,674 over a five-year period, compared with $27,887 among their male counterparts. Higher education may help young people—those who choose to further their studies—to weather the economic storm. Although high school graduates may lose less in dollar earnings than postsecondary graduates, these potential losses represent a larger share of their earnings since high school graduates earn considerably less than postsecondary graduates on average. For example, under the worst case scenario examined in this study, male high school graduates may lose 19.9% in earnings, compared with 11.6% among their counterparts with a bachelor's degree.

Total investment in building construction increased 5.9% to $18.6 billion in March, led by the residential sector. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction was up 5.2% to $14.3 billion in March. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Residential investment continues to set records Residential construction investment increased for the eleventh consecutive month, up 7.6% to $14.0 billion in March. Investment in single units jumped 10.7% to $7.8 billion. Quebec led the way with an increase of 30.4%, bringing investment in single homes to $1.9 billion for the province. Investment in Ontario was up 9.8% to $3.3 billion, driven by renovations to single family homes in the census metropolitan area of Toronto. Growth in multi-unit construction continued, up 3.9% to $6.2 billion. Gains in Quebec and Ontario led the overall increase in this component, as six provinces reported declines. Both new construction and renovations of condominiums and apartments in the cities of Toronto and Montréal accounted for most of the growth. Infographic 1 Investment in residential building construction, March 2021 Non-residential investment increases slightly Non-residential construction investment rose 1.1% to $4.6 billion in March, with all components posting slight increases. Despite this gain, the commercial and industrial investment components were below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Institutional construction investment was up 2.2% to $1.2 billion. Multiple high-value projects in Montréal contributed to a 2.6% increase in Quebec, where investment totalled $315 million in March. Investments in the province included a new elementary school in Laval and renovations to a secondary school in Montréal. British Columbia recorded another strong month in March, with the continued construction of new schools in Burnaby, North Vancouver and Vancouver. Commercial building construction rose 0.8% to $2.6 billion. Six provinces recorded slight gains, led by Ontario and Alberta. Large office building renovation projects in Edmonton and Calgary contributed to the 1.7% gain in Alberta in this component. Investment in industrial construction edged up 0.4% to $823 million in March. Increases in Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec offset six provincial declines. Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in non-residential building construction, March 2021 Residential investment drives first quarter of the year The total value of investment in building construction rose 9.3% to $53.1 billion in the first quarter, stemming from continued strength in the residential sector (+12.4%). Investment for residential buildings reached $39.5 billion, largely because of increased spending on single units in Ontario (+21.8%) and Quebec (+24.9%). Non-residential investment rose 1.1% to $13.6 billion in the first quarter, following a 6.0% decline in the previous quarter. Institutional construction advanced 3.0% in the first quarter, driven by strength in British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador, which recorded their highest levels for this component since the start of the series in 2010. Nova Scotia jumped 55.0%, reporting the highest quarterly value since the third quarter of 2014. Investment in commercial construction advanced slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, with the gain largely due to strength in Ontario. However, investment in this component was below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, down 13.8% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The industrial component edged down 0.2%, largely as a result of declines in Alberta. For more information on housing, please visit the Housing Statistics Portal. Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. As per Statistics Canada practices, data for the previous year have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous three years have also been revised. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted with current dollar values unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates in constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (Table 18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to the structure type ""single."" Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage. Effective November 23, 2018, Table 34-10-0175-01 contains data on both the residential and the non-residential sectors. It replaced tables 34-10-0010-01, 34-10-0011-01 and 34-10-0012-01. Next release Data on investment in building construction for April will be released on June 10.

This 10th consecutive monthly increase continued to offset the steepest drops in Canadian economic activity on record in March and April 2020. However, total economic activity was about 2% below the level observed in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout April 2021, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. The survey collects information on business expectations moving forward and the ongoing impact of the pandemic on businesses in Canada. Over the next three months, one-third of businesses expected their profitability to decrease, one-quarter expected their sales to decrease, one-fifth expected to increase the prices they charge and three-quarters expected their number of employees to remain the same. Businesses were concerned with future survival and expected to face a variety of obstacles in the short term. Many businesses anticipate lower profitability in the short term Over one-third (37.1%) of all businesses and over half (51.6%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expected their profitability to decrease over the next three months (see note to readers). Conversely, 12.4% of businesses expected their profitability to increase, most notably, those in wholesale trade (19.4%), manufacturing (18.0%) and retail trade (17.0%). Just over one-quarter (25.7%) of businesses expected their sales to decrease over the next three months, down from nearly one-third of businesses last quarter. Businesses in accommodation and food services (42.1%) were most likely to expect sales to fall. Nearly one-fifth (19.9%) of businesses expected to raise prices over the next three months, up from 14.0% last cycle, with those in manufacturing (33.9%), wholesale trade (33.7%) and construction (31.0%) most likely to expect to do so. Over three-quarters (77.6%) of businesses expected their number of employees to remain the same over the next three months, up from 70.6% last cycle. Conversely, 8.8% of businesses expected their number of employees to decrease, down from 11.7% last quarter. Over one-fifth (20.5%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expected a reduction in their number of employees over the next three months, down from 29.6% last quarter. In terms of vacant positions, 6.8% of businesses expected to have more job vacancies over the next three months. In accommodation and food services, 13.4% of businesses expected to have more vacant positions. Business survival and plans over the next year Over two-thirds (68.5%) of businesses reported they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for 12 months or more before considering closure or bankruptcy. Similar to last quarter, almost 1 in 10 (9.5%) businesses reported they could continue for less than 12 months. Under one-quarter of businesses in accommodation and food services (22.8%) reported they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before having to consider closure or bankruptcy, down from 24.9% of businesses last quarter. Over three-fifths (61.6%) of businesses reported they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for 12 months or more before considering laying off staff, while just over one-fifth (20.7%) reported they could continue for less than 12 months before considering laying off staff. Businesses in accommodation and food services (38.4%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (29.4%) were most likely to report they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before considering laying off staff. One in eight businesses (12.1%) had plans to expand or restructure, or had plans to acquire or invest in other businesses in the next year. Similar to last cycle, 2.9% of businesses had plans to transfer or sell their business within the next year. Meanwhile, 1.3% of businesses had plans to close their business, down from 2.4% of businesses last quarter. Three-quarters (75.0%) of businesses had the cash or liquid assets required to operate over the next three months. While two-fifths (42.9%) of businesses reported that they did not need to take on more debt, 14.8% of businesses reported that they could not take on more debt. Of businesses that could not take on more debt, the most commonly reported reasons were lack of confidence or uncertainty in future sales (56.2%), cash flow (47.2%) and expectations that the request would be turned down (22.0%). Just over one-quarter (25.3%) of businesses in accommodation and food services and over one-fifth (23.6%) of businesses in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction reported that they did not have the ability to take on more debt. Businesses expect to face a variety of obstacles During these uncertain times, businesses are faced with a variety of obstacles and future unknowns. The rising cost of inputs, including labour, capital, energy and raw materials, was the most commonly expected obstacle over the next three months (37.8%), up from 25.5% of businesses that expected this to be an obstacle last quarter. The rising cost of inputs was expected to be an obstacle for around three-fifths of businesses in construction (62.1%), agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (62.0%), and manufacturing (59.2%). Businesses expected to face obstacles related to the workforce. Recruiting skilled employees was expected to be an obstacle for over one-quarter (27.8%) of all businesses, led by businesses in manufacturing (39.1%), construction (35.2%), retail trade (32.4%), and accommodation and food services (32.3%). In addition, shortage of labour force (23.8%) and retaining skilled employees (22.1%) were expected obstacles for over one-fifth of businesses. Over one-quarter (27.8%) of businesses expected attracting new or returning customers to be an obstacle over the next three months. It was expected to be an obstacle for over two-fifths of businesses in information and cultural industries (43.2%), accommodation and food services (42.6%), and arts, entertainment and recreation (41.4%). Businesses shift to increase online sales capabilities The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with temporary store closures and physical distancing measures, prompted many Canadian retailers to open or expand their e-commerce presence, quickly changing the retail landscape. Retail e-commerce rose from 3.5% of total retail sales in 2019 to 5.9% in 2020. In December alone, online sales were up by over two-thirds (+69.3%) year over year to $4.7 billion. In addition to efforts made by businesses to increase e-commerce capabilities over the past year, businesses planned to continue to make such investments. Just over one-fifth (20.1%) of all businesses were likely to invest in online sales or e-commerce capabilities over the next 12 months. Businesses in information and cultural industries (41.8%), retail trade (37.8%), and wholesale trade (36.1%) were most likely to invest in online sales or e-commerce capabilities over the next 12 months. Almost one-fifth (18.6%) of businesses reported they were likely going to permanently increase their online sales capacity once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Businesses in retail trade (37.0%) and wholesale trade (34.3%) were most likely to report permanently increasing their online sales capacity once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. The availability of 5G wireless technology is expected to have a moderate or major impact on 16.2% of businesses, led by businesses in information and cultural industries (27.5%). Table 1 Expected obstacles to businesses or organizations over the next three months, by selected industries, second quarter of 2021 Note to readers Data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions are now available. The tables provide data at the national, provincial and territorial level by industrial sector, by employment size, by type of business and by majority ownership. Data are also available for the 20 largest cities in Canada, by request. Data in this release are from Statistics Canada's Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. Results from this survey are applicable to employer businesses in Canada. This survey is carried out on a quarterly basis to collect information from businesses in Canada more efficiently and rapidly compared with traditional survey methods. The most recent survey was conducted from April 1 to May 6, 2021, and respondents were asked what their expectations would be over the next three-month period. As a result, those three months could range from April 1 to August 6, 2021, depending on when the business responded. This survey collected data from businesses on the current economic situation and will be used to effectively assess their needs for the implementation of support measures both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistics Canada would like to thank Canadians who took the time to answer questions for this survey at this time and enable a more robust understanding of COVID-19's impact on Canadian businesses and the economy.

Lower- and middle-income earners recorded the largest annual increases in disposable income, as government COVID-19 support measures outpaced losses in compensation of employees and self-employment mixed income. As a result, the gap between the lowest- and highest-income households, calculated as the difference between their respective shares of total disposable income, shrank 1.9 percentage points in 2020 compared with 2019. The economic well-being of the lowest-income earners increased more than that of any other households in 2020, with those in the lowest income quintile recording gains of 17.6% in disposable income and 10.7% in net worth relative to 2019. Gains in net worth for the lowest-income earners were driven by larger percentage increases in real estate assets that outpaced increases in mortgage debt. Households in the lowest income quintile reduced their non-mortgage debt by more than other households, also contributing to their larger percentage gain in net worth in 2020. Despite fourth-quarter declines, household income up in 2020 Disposable income declined for most households in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the largest losses for the lowest-income earners (-10.2%). Despite declines at the end of the year, lower- and middle-income households recorded the largest increases in disposable income, rising by 13.0% to 17.6% in 2020 compared with 2019. The overall gains were led by unprecedented increases in current transfers in the second quarter, as governments' COVID-19 support measures were implemented to help mitigate negative impacts from the pandemic. If the government had not provided financial support to households, their disposable income would still have increased in 2020, but to a much lesser extent. Excluding the COVID-19 support measures, the lowest-income and youngest households would have seen the smallest gain in disposable income. This is because the COVID-19 support measures had a larger overall impact on the disposable income of the lowest-income and youngest earners in Canada, representing 9% to 14% of their total income in 2020. It is important to note that this analysis only estimates the direct impact of government transfers on household disposable income. It does not take into consideration any indirect impacts that government support measures had on household economic or financial well-being. These include the potential effects of economic scarring in the absence of such measures, including an increased incidence of job loss or insolvencies. Chart 1 Change in household disposable income, by income quintile, 2020 Chart 2 Change in household disposable income, by age group, 2020 Lowest-income and youngest households see largest wage losses in 2020 In contrast to disposable income, compensation of employees—of which wages and salaries make up the largest share—was up in the fourth quarter, with lower-income and older households (65 years and older) recording the biggest gains. Despite the uptick in the second half of the year, compensation of employees was lower in 2020 compared with 2019 for all households. The most pronounced wage losses were experienced by the lowest-income (-5.3%) and the youngest (-3.1%) households, as many people in these households work in industries or jobs hard hit by the pandemic. Employment Insurance benefits rise in fourth quarter as COVID-19 support measures ease In fall 2020, the federal government modified Employment Insurance (EI) eligibility and implemented three new COVID-19 support measures to provide financial assistance to households unable to qualify for EI. The result of these changes was a decline in COVID-19-specific support measures and a significant rise in EI benefits in the fourth quarter of 2020. While all households recorded notable increases in EI benefits in the fourth quarter, those younger than 45 had the largest uptick. Despite rebound in the second half of the year, household spending down and net saving up in 2020 Household spending rose as pandemic restrictions continued to ease in the fourth quarter, with lower-income and older households (65 years and older) posting the largest increases. Despite the uptick in the second half of the year, overall consumption expenditure was down in 2020 compared with 2019. The youngest and highest-income earners recorded the biggest declines, reducing their consumption expenditure by 5.7% and 7.0%, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2020, net saving for many households declined as their disposable income decreased and consumption edged up. The only households to record gains in net saving in the fourth quarter were the highest-income earners and those with a major income earner aged 35 to 44 years. Although net saving declined for many at the end of the year, all households recorded improved net saving in 2020 compared with 2019. Middle-income households experienced some of the biggest gains as they switched to a net saving position in 2020 from a net dissaving position in 2019. Chart 3 Household average net saving, by income quintile, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020 Chart 4 Household average net saving, by age group, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020 Lowest-income earners see their wealth increase the most throughout the year, because of gains in real estate Household wealth reached $12.8 trillion as of the fourth quarter of 2020, up $461 billion from the third quarter, with each disposable income quintile growing at roughly the same pace (about +4.0%) over that period. Throughout the year, wealth grew more for the lowest-income earners (+10.7%) compared with the highest-income earners (+9.0%), mainly because of consistently higher gains in real estate. Chart 5 Change in household net worth, by income quintile, including contribution of each wealth component, fourth quarter 2020 relative to fourth quarter 2019 Lower-income households increase their mortgage debt the most throughout the year, while they rely less on non-mortgage debt to finance consumer goods purchases While fourth-quarter growth in mortgage debt was similar for all households (roughly +2% relative to the third quarter of 2020), lower-income households increased their mortgage debt obligations the most throughout the year (by more than 7% relative to the fourth quarter of 2019), along with higher increases in the value of their real estate acquisitions. After business shutdowns were eased in the latter half of the year, all households increased their acquisition of consumer goods, such as cars, electronics and appliances. While lower-income households increased their non-mortgage debt to purchase consumer goods in the fourth quarter, the highest-income earners avoided additional borrowing. Households in the three lowest income quintiles collectively accounted for 83.8% of the $1.6 billion increase in non-mortgage debt in the fourth quarter. However, for the entire year, all households decreased their non-mortgage debt obligations, especially the lowest-income earners (-1.6%). Younger households increase their wealth by more than older households as gains in real estate and consumer goods purchases outpace increases in debt Although households with a major income earner younger than 35 held the least wealth of any age group, they saw their average net worth increase by more than that of older households. Similar to trends earlier in the year, which were driven by gains in value in the acquisition of real estate that outpaced growth in mortgage debt obligations, the net worth of households with a major income earner younger than 35 rose 4.5% in the fourth quarter, while net worth for those with a major income earner aged 55 or older grew by 3.6%. Chart 6 Quarterly change in net worth, by age group of household major income earner, indexed to fourth quarter 2019 Along with continued low mortgage lending rates offered by financial institutions as a result of the pandemic, younger households increased their mortgage debt by more than older households in the fourth quarter. Average mortgage debt for households with a major income earner younger than 35 rose 3.5% in the fourth quarter, while all other age groups increased their mortgage debt by less than 2% relative to the previous quarter. As well, households with a major income earner younger than 35 increased their holdings of consumer goods by 2.8% in the fourth quarter, more than double the rate of any other age group. However, most of these purchases were financed through savings or debt consolidation rather than through additional borrowing—the non-mortgage debt of households with a major income earner younger than 35 grew 1.3% in the same quarter. Debt-to-income ratio grows most for lower-income earners and younger households, but remains below pre-pandemic levels The debt-to-income ratio increased the most for households in the lowest income quintile, reaching 259.5% in the fourth quarter (up 30.3 percentage points from the third quarter), and for those younger than 35 years, reaching 199.9% (up 8.6 percentage points). While mortgage debt continued to grow in the fourth quarter, increases in employment earnings were offset by reductions in pandemic-related government benefits. Despite fourth-quarter increases, households' debt-to-income ratios remained below pre-pandemic levels. As the effects of the pandemic continue to filter through the economy, upcoming quarterly releases on the distributions of household economic accounts will shed further light on the evolution of household economic well-being throughout the 2021 reference year and beyond. Table 1 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Table 2 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Table 3 Net worth, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Table 4 Net worth, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Note to readers Statistics Canada regularly publishes macroeconomic indicators on household disposable income, final consumption expenditure, net saving and wealth as part of the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (CSMA). These accounts are aligned with the most recent international standards and are compiled for all sectors of the economy, including households, non-profit institutions, governments and corporations, along with Canada's financial position vis-à-vis the rest of the world. While the CSMA provides high-quality information on the overall position of households relative to other economic sectors, the distributions of household economic accounts (DHEA) provide additional granularity to address questions such as vulnerabilities of specific groups and the resulting implications for economic well-being and financial stability. They are therefore an important complement to standard quarterly outputs related to the economy. The quarterly DHEA estimates released today are experimental estimates of income, consumption, saving and wealth and their sub-components by various household distributions for 2020. Estimates for the first to the third quarters have been revised to include the latest CSMA benchmarks, as well as new microdata on household income, consumption and wealth. As with all data, these experimental quarterly DHEA estimates are not without their limitations. For the most part, these experimental data rely on the same concepts and methods as the annual DHEA. However, to produce the DHEA on a quarterly basis, new data sources were used and assumptions were made. DHEA estimates for wages and salaries were derived using Statistics Canada's Social Policy Simulation Database and Model, which incorporate data from the Labour Force Survey for employment by industry and wage level. The distributions of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit were aligned with microdata from Employment and Social Development Canada. Aggregate data on DHEA liabilities were distributed to household groups using sub-aggregate data purchased from a consumer credit rating agency. Because of scarcity in available microdata sources, aggregate estimates of DHEA household final consumption expenditure and household assets were allocated according to the DHEA distributions for reference year 2019. In an effort to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic well-being of households in Canada, these experimental DHEA estimates hold constant the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 2019 when estimating quarterly changes in income, consumption, saving and wealth throughout 2020. It is therefore assumed that all households remained in the same distributional category in which they were in the 2019 DHEA (e.g., age group, equivalized disposable income quintile, household composition). When the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of 2019 are held constant, it is possible to estimate changes in various household economic indicators without intersecting with changes attributable to households moving across distributional groups. This approach allows for a clearer identification of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on household distributions, as well as the associated impacts of economic restrictions and government support measures on household economic well-being. The DHEA estimates released today are benchmarked to the quarterly income and expenditure accounts and the national balance sheet accounts published in March 2021. All values are expressed in quarterly nominal unadjusted rates, unless otherwise specified.

March data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are now available. The SEPH provides an account of payroll employment—that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits during a given month—as well as earnings and hours worked. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which provides an account of the number of people working during a specific week in the month, data from the SEPH and the JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions in Canada. In March, prior to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, public health measures were partially and gradually eased in several parts of the country. In the Atlantic region, provinces eased restrictions to varying degrees throughout March. In Quebec, measures affecting restaurants and recreation and entertainment facilities were eased in some regions in late February and early March, while Montréal and surrounding regions remained under the highest level of restrictions. In Ontario, stay-at-home orders were lifted for all regions, although personal care services, recreation and fitness facilities, and in-person dining remained closed in some areas, including Toronto. Various measures were also eased in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Services-producing sector drives payroll employment increase in March The number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer—measured in the SEPH as payroll employment—increased by 245,800 (+1.5%) in March, the strongest monthly growth since September 2020. The March LFS recorded an increase of 303,000 (+1.6%) in the number of people employed (including self-employed). The increases in both the SEPH and the LFS were driven by the services-producing sector, as easing public health measures allowed many businesses in retail trade and accommodation and food services to reopen. Compared with February 2020, payroll employment in Canada was down by 897,900 (-5.3%) in March 2021. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in March at fastest rate since September 2020 SEPH payroll employment rose in eight provinces, with the largest increases in Ontario (+111,600; +1.8%), Quebec (+59,900; +1.7%) and Alberta (+33,700; +1.8%). Employment fell in Newfoundland and Labrador (-1,200; -0.6%), driven by a decline in accommodation and food services (-1,300; -9.9%), as in-person dining remained closed in St. John's and the Avalon Peninsula. Average weekly earnings down in March as hourly paid employment increases Average weekly earnings were $1,125 in March, down 0.8% from the previous month, as employment gains in March were driven by hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees. Compared with February 2020, earnings were 7.6% higher in March 2021. The higher average weekly earnings since the beginning of the pandemic reflect a number of factors, including the composition of the overall labour market in terms of the distribution of hourly paid and salaried employees and industries of employment. While the employment gap between hourly paid and salaried employees narrowed in March, the number of hourly paid employees was 6.1% below its pre-COVID-19 level, while the number of salaried employees was 4.1% below its pre-COVID-19 level. Likewise, the sectors that remained furthest from their pre-COVID-19 employment levels—arts, entertainment and recreation (-36.5%), and accommodation and food services (-29.3%)—are among those with the lowest average weekly earnings. Average hours worked decrease for hourly paid employees Average hours worked per week for hourly paid employees were 31.6 in March, 1.3% lower than in February. Average hours worked per week for salaried employees were little changed, at 37.1. Payroll employment increases in services-producing sectors as public health measures eased Payroll employment increased in most services-producing sectors in March (+220,800; +1.7%), led by retail trade (+77,200; +4.1%), and accommodation and food services (+39,900; +4.4%), as public health measures were eased in many jurisdictions. Despite the increase in March, payroll employment in retail trade was 2.9% below its pre-COVID-19 level, while employment in accommodation and food services was 29.3% below its pre-COVID-19 level. The largest growth in payroll employment in retail trade was in clothing and clothing accessories stores (+27,200; +17.4%), followed by sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+11,500; +17.4%). As reported in the retail trade release, retail sales rose 3.6% in March. Average weekly earnings in retail trade were $633 in March, up 1.1% compared with February 2020. Payroll employment in full-service restaurants and limited-service eating places, the largest industry within accommodation and food services, rose by 34,900 (+4.8%) in March as restrictions affecting this industry continued to be eased. Average weekly earnings in accommodation and food services were $448 in March, up 4.4% compared with February 2020. Upward trend continues for payroll employment in health care and social assistance Payroll employment in health care and social assistance continued to increase in March, up 22,100 (+1.1%), bringing employment to 1.8% above its pre-COVID-19 level. The increase was led by ambulatory health care services (+10,800; +1.8%), which include out-patient care centres and home health care services. Payroll employment in this subsector has been on an upward trend since May 2020, and, in March 2021, it was 7.6% above its pre-COVID-19 level. Chart 2 Payroll employment continues to increase in health care and social assistance, led by ambulatory health care services Average weekly earnings in health care and social assistance were $1,010 in March, up 5.8% compared with February 2020. Payroll employment gains in the goods-producing sector driven by construction and manufacturing While most of the growth in payroll employment in March was in the services-producing sector, there was also a notable increase in the goods-producing sector (+20,900; +0.7%), driven by construction (+11,100; +1.1%) and manufacturing (+7,700; +0.5%). The March payroll employment increase in construction was shared between all three subsectors (specialty trade contractors, heavy and civil engineering construction, and construction of buildings). The month-over-month gain brought payroll employment in construction to 0.7% below its pre-COVID-19 level observed in February 2020, the highest it has been since the onset of the pandemic. There were notable month-over-month payroll employment gains in 10 of the 21 subsectors in manufacturing, with the largest increase in food manufacturing. As of March, the number of payroll employees in the sector was 4.0% below its February 2020 level, closer to its pre-COVID-19 level than at any point since the onset of the pandemic. One-sixth of all job vacancies in Canada in March are in the health care and social assistance sector In March, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 632,700 positions (not seasonally adjusted), corresponding to a job vacancy rate of 4.1% (vacant positions as a proportion of all positions, vacant and occupied). This followed rates between 3.0% and 3.9% from October 2020 to February 2021. Quebec (5.1%) and British Columbia (4.9%) continued to have the highest job vacancy rates among the provinces (not seasonally adjusted). In March, health care and social assistance had more job vacancies (104,200, not seasonally adjusted) than any other sector, for a fifth consecutive month. One-sixth of all job vacancies in Canada in the month were in this sector. Retail trade (75,300) and accommodation and food services (68,400) had the second- and third-highest numbers of job vacancies among the sectors (not seasonally adjusted). The job vacancy rate in accommodation and food services was 7.4% in March, higher than in all other sectors in the month, and the highest job vacancy rate for this sector since monthly job vacancy estimates became available in October 2020. The vacancy rate in accommodation and food services reflected increased recruitment in the sector prior to the onset of the third wave of COVID-19 at the end of the month. Looking ahead: Impact of COVID-19 third wave After nearly two months of loosened restrictions in several parts of the country, signs of an imminent third wave of COVID-19 started to appear before the end of March, leading to tighter public health measures across Canada throughout the month of April. April SEPH data—to be released on June 24—will provide detailed information on sectors and subsectors that may have been impacted by the tightening of COVID-19 public health measures that month. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. Payroll employment, as measured by the SEPH, refers to the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and the LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and the SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupation for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wages and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time data tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on June 14. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours, and job vacancies for April will be released on June 24. Products More information about the concepts and use of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is available in the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). The product ""Earnings and payroll employment in brief: Interactive app"" (Catalogue number14200001) is now available. This interactive data visualization application provides a comprehensive picture of the Canadian labour market using the most recent data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours. The estimates are seasonally adjusted and available by province and largest industrial sector. Historical estimates going back 10 years are also included.

In the first quarter of 2021, Canadian corporations reported an increase of 18.1% (+$15.4 billion) in net income before taxes, to $100.7 billion. Operating revenue edged up 0.6% (+$6.7 billion) to $1,103.7 billion during the quarter. In the first quarter, the financial sector in Canada recorded an increase in net income before taxes of 11.0% (+$3.9 billion). Net income before taxes in the non-financial sector increased by 23.1% (+$11.5 billion) to $61.2 billion in the first quarter. Chart 1 Corporate net income before taxes (seasonally adjusted) Net income before taxes increases for industries operating in the energy sector Net income before taxes in the mining and quarrying and support activities industry recorded a $4.5 billion increase, reaching $3.3 billion. The increase was attributable in part to higher commodity prices. Additionally, expenses for the industry fell in the first quarter because of a decline in expenses associated with asset revaluations, as most of these expenses were booked in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net income before taxes in the oil and gas extraction and support services industry increased by $2.4 billion (+53.8%) in the first quarter. This increase is mainly attributable to higher oil prices, reflecting continued growth in demand for crude from the lows of the second quarter of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the industry continued to report losses for a fifth subsequent quarter, recording a loss of $2.1 billion. This was an improvement from the loss of $4.5 billion in the previous quarter. Manufacturing net income before taxes increases Net income before taxes in the manufacturing sector increased by $2.5 billion (+19.5%), reaching $15.3 billion in the first quarter, bolstered by growth in several industries. Petroleum and coal product manufacturing led the increase in net income before taxes within the manufacturing sector, up $3.7 billion (+203.3%) as global demand continued to grow in the first quarter. Higher prices helped operating revenue in this industry reach its peak level since the first quarter of 2020. Net income before taxes in the primary metal and fabricated metal product and machinery manufacturing industry increased $905 million (+68.3%), because of increased volumes and prices for outputs of steel mills and ferro-alloy manufacturing. Net income before taxes in aerospace, rail and ship products and other transportation equipment manufacturing increased $413 million (+303.7%), as demand for large-cabin aircraft and private jets is benefitting from a rebound in air travel and higher aircraft utilization rates. Partially offsetting these increases in net income before taxes for the manufacturing sector was the pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, and soap, agricultural chemicals, paint and other chemical product manufacturing industry, which decreased $1.6 billion (-76.0%), mainly because of a decline in revenue from investment activities. Retail trade sector net income before taxes increases Net income before taxes in the retail trade sector increased 7.3% (+$488 million) to $7.2 billion. The largest contributor to the gain was food and beverages stores, which posted an increase of 48.7% (+$923 million). Retailers saw decreased foot traffic in their stores, but this was offset by customers buying a larger quantity of goods in each visit. Higher prices further buoyed the performance of the sector. Motor vehicle and parts dealers' net income before taxes rose 40.7% (+$247 million), attributable to an increase in operating revenue as a result of higher sales at new car dealers and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores. Clothing, sporting goods, and general merchandise stores recorded a decrease in net income before taxes, down $332 million (-21.4%), following the implementation of COVID-19-related restrictions for non-essential retailers. Wholesale trade net income before taxes decreases Net income before taxes in the wholesale trade sector decreased $337 million (-3.8%) in the first quarter, to $8.6 billion. Building material and supplies merchant wholesalers saw an increase in net income before taxes, up $1.8 billion (+182.1%), as demand for new homes and supplies for home improvement continued to surge. Net income before taxes in the financial sector grows for a fourth consecutive quarter Net income before taxes for financial corporations increased 11.0% (+$3.9 billion) to $39.5 billion in the first quarter. The banking and other depository credit intermediation industry saw continued growth in net income before tax for a fourth quarter in a row, up 31.7% (+$3.4 billion). These gains are attributable to higher non-interest income. Decreased provisions for credit losses and higher loan volumes further buoyed the industry's performance in the first quarter. Among insurance carriers, net income before taxes fell 10.8% (-$663 million). The decrease was led by life, health and medical insurance carriers, which saw their net income before taxes fall 22.0%, because of increased expenses arising from actuarial liabilities. Partially offsetting these losses, property and casualty insurance carriers saw an increase of 17.6% (+$360 million) in net income before taxes. Dashboard now available The ""Quarterly Survey of Financial Statistics: Visualization Tool"" is a comprehensive analytical tool that presents quarterly changes in the financial performance of enterprises. Note to readers Data from the Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements (QSFS) include amounts from government programs that support businesses, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. These amounts are considered to be revenue for these businesses. However, with response rates lower than historical averages, the potential delay in the release of this information by businesses, and the methodology used to calculate QSFS estimates, use of these government support programs may be underestimated in the published data. Data on quarterly net income before taxes in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Quarterly financial statistics for enterprises are based on a sample survey and represent the activities of all corporations in Canada, except those that are government-controlled or not-for-profit. The survey collects data on balance sheets, income statements and additional disclosures of enterprises. An enterprise can be a single corporation or a family of corporations under common ownership or control, for which consolidated financial statements are produced. Survey changes The following changes were introduced to the survey starting with the first quarter of 2020: New content was implemented in the first quarter to align the survey to new accounting standards adopted by corporations starting in 2011. New industrial breakdowns were implemented, allowing for more granularity in the dissemination of data. As a result, some industry groupings were merged, others were split and some remained the same. The survey's sample was modified to support the new industrial breakdowns; however, a maximum sample overlap with the previous sample was adopted. A more automated imputation strategy was implemented to streamline the process and to reduce the need for manual intervention. Revisions, benchmarking and backcasting The release of the QSFS for the first quarter of 2021 includes revised estimates from all four quarters of 2020. Efforts are being made to backcast these data to the first quarter of 2010 to allow for better historical comparisons. However, as more than one cycle of the new content is required before this exercise can begin, users are encouraged to be cautious when making historical comparisons. It is expected that the backcasting work will be completed and results will be released at the end of 2021. Larger-than-usual revisions may be anticipated in the future, as quarterly revisions, annual benchmarking, backcasting and new survey data received from respondents will be incorporated to improve data quality and include the most up-to-date data. Business performance and ownership statistics portal The Business performance and ownership statistics portal, accessible from the Subjects module of our website, provides users a single point of access to a wide variety of information related to business performance and ownership in Canada. Next release Financial statistics for enterprises for the second quarter of 2021 will be released on August 24, 2021. Products Aggregate balance sheet and income statement data for Canadian corporations are now available. Data from the Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements are also available.

A new study released today shows that, at the start of the 2020/2021 school year, when faced with unprecedented youth unemployment and postsecondary education moving online, young women aged 17 to 24 responded by enrolling in postsecondary institutions at a higher rate than a year earlier. There was no increase among young men. These decisions, which can be influenced by available resources and previous educational attainment, affected the proportion of youth who were not in employment, education or training (NEET). The proportion of NEET youth is closely monitored, as these youth may be at increased risk of low income and social exclusion, particularly if the NEET situation persists over time. For young women aged 15 to 29, the year-over-year increase in postsecondary attendance from September-October 2019 to September-October 2020 resulted in a smaller increase in their rate of NEET (+1 percentage point), compared with same-aged young men (+4 percentage points). Consequently, in the fall of 2020, young women were less likely than young men to be neither employed nor enrolled in school (12% versus 14% for young men). As the school year progressed, the rate of young women's postsecondary attendance continued to be higher than in the 2019/2020 school year, with their NEET rate remaining lower than that of young men. Young women's postsecondary attendance increased, while that of young men remained stable The participation of young women aged 15 to 29 in postsecondary school increased to 32% at the start of the 2020/2021 academic year, compared with 29% at the start of the 2019/2020 school year. By comparison, young men's participation stayed constant at 23%. This increase in young women's postsecondary enrolment was driven by those aged 17 to 24. Specifically, postsecondary attendance rose from 48% to 53% for young women aged 17 to 19, and from 46% to 50% for young women aged 20 to 24. Meanwhile, there were no significant changes among young men for any age category. Postsecondary attendance, which is typically lower among men than women, hovered around 38% to 40% for young men aged 17 to 19, and around 35% to 36% range for young men aged 20 to 24. Increase in postsecondary studies only seen for young Canadian-born women While the postsecondary attendance rate of young Canadian-born women increased, the proportion of young immigrant women attending postsecondary schooling remained constant. The stability in the rate of postsecondary attendance among immigrant women cannot be explained by factors related to the pandemic, including any drops in international students or changes in immigration patterns during this period, as both foreign nationals with study permits and newly arrived immigrants were excluded from the study. Further research will be necessary to better understand differences in postsecondary attendance patterns between young immigrant women and Canadian-born women. Partly because of the difference in postsecondary patterns at the start of the 2020/2021 school year, the NEET rate remained constant for young Canadian-born women, at 11% compared with 10% in the previous year. By contrast, the NEET rate rose from 13% to 17% for young immigrant women, widening the gap in the NEET rate between the two groups. The NEET rates of young Canadian-born men and young immigrant men were similar during early fall 2020. The employment rate of female postsecondary students fell sharply One important economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic that is not captured in the NEET rate is the decline in student employment among women. Young women attending postsecondary schools are typically more likely to be employed than young men. Before the pandemic, from September to October 2019, 56% of women and 45% of men aged 15 to 29 attending postsecondary school were employed. These jobs can help students fund their studies and provide work experience. As a result of the pandemic, the employment rate of students declined year over year from 56% to 49% for young women, while it remained stable for young men. This was predominantly due to decreases in employment in the accommodation and food services sector for young women. This disparity continued through the second wave of the pandemic from November 2020 to February 2021 and proved to be a leading contributor to the greater employment losses among women, compared with men during this period. Indeed, gender differences in employment declines were smaller for non-student youth and for people aged 30 to 54. Note to readers This release summarizes findings of the article released today, ""Gendered impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the proportion of youth neither in employment nor education at the start of the school year."" The article examines the impact of the pandemic on the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET), an indicator related to current and longer-term economic and social well-being. Rates and characteristics (gender, age groups, immigrant status, belonging to a designated visible minority group, Indigenous identity and province of residence) are presented for three mutually exclusive categories: young people who are NEET, young people attending school, and young people who are working and no longer attending school. The article is based on data from the Labour Force Survey.

Retail sales were up 3.6% to $57.6 billion in March, led by higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and clothing and clothing accessories stores. Sales at food and beverage stores declined. Sales increased in 10 of 11 subsectors, representing 79.1% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude sales at gasoline stations, and motor vehicle and parts dealers—rose 4.7%. In volume terms, retail sales increased 3.2% in March. Retail sales were up 1.8% in the first quarter—the third consecutive quarterly increase. In volume terms, quarterly sales were up 0.5%. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, 2.1% of retailers were closed at some point in March. The average length of the closure was less than one day. This represented a widespread reopening of the economy between the second and third waves of the pandemic. In February, 12.0% of retailers were closed for an average of two days. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 5.1% in April. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 46% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 90.7%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in March Core retail sales rise as stores reopen Core retail sales rose for the second consecutive month, up 4.7% in March on higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+19.8%). This was the largest increase since May 2020 and coincided with warmer-than-typical March weather and the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in some areas of the country. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores rose for the second straight month, up 23.6% in March, to their highest level since the beginning of the pandemic. The increase in March is attributable to higher sales at clothing stores (+25.0%) and shoe stores (+42.8%). Sales at jewellery, luggage and leather goods stores edged down 0.1%. In March, 5.1% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of one day; in February, 38.8% were closed for an average of six days. The lone decline in March was at food and beverage stores (-1.3%), where sales decreased for the third time in four months on lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores (-1.6%) and specialty food stores (-12.0%). These declines were partially offset by higher sales at beer, wine and liquor stores (+3.1%). Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations rise for the third consecutive month Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased for the third consecutive month, up 1.4% in March. The growth is mostly attributable to higher sales at other motor vehicle dealers (+11.8%) and new car dealers (+0.7%). Sales at gasoline stations also increased for the third month in a row, rising 1.8% in March on higher gasoline prices. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations declined 0.8%. Chart 2 Sales up in 10 of 11 subsectors Sales up in six provinces Sales were up in six provinces in March, with Ontario accounting for the majority of the increase. In Ontario, sales rose 9.0% on higher sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores, and building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers. This was the largest monthly increase in Ontario since June 2020, when sales were up 32.3%. Sales rose 6.8% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, coinciding with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Quebec (+2.2%) posted the second-largest provincial increase, on higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and general merchandise stores. In the CMA of Montréal, sales were up 4.1%. Retail e-commerce in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 58.5% year over year to $3.7 billion in March, accounting for 6.3% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales fell 0.7 percentage points in March as more brick-and-mortar stores were allowed to open their doors to in-person shopping. On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 1.5% in March. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada.""

This could have long-term ramifications for class of 2020 high school and postsecondary graduates as they enter the labour market. A new study presents estimates of the cumulative earnings losses in the first five years after graduation that this year's graduating class could experience, depending on the depth of the economic downturn. Specifically, five scenarios for this year's youth unemployment rate are examined in comparison with the long-term historical average of 14.3%: 16.0%, 19.0%, 22.0%, 25.0%, and 28.0%. Other factors may impact the earnings of graduates, but these are not considered in this study. Students belonging to this year's class of high school, college, and bachelor's degree graduates could lose from $23,000 to $44,000 over the next five years if this year's annual youth unemployment rate reaches 28.0%. This is equivalent to $4,600 to $8,800 per year. Although such losses are at least as large as the average debt load of postsecondary graduates, they are quite small compared with the estimated long-term benefits of graduating with a postsecondary qualification rather than a high school diploma based on an earlier Statistics Canada study. For example, mid-career university graduates generally earn about twice as much as their high school graduate counterparts, corresponding to a difference of roughly $40,000 in one year alone. If, instead, this year's youth unemployment rate reaches 19.0%, which is close to the historical high of 19.2% (set in 1983), earnings losses are likely to be far more moderate (from about $8,000 to $15,000 over the next five years, or about $1,600 to $3,000 per year). Under a scenario where the youth labour market recovers very quickly and the youth unemployment rate reaches 16.0% this year, five-year losses could amount to less than $6,000 for all groups, or less than $1,200 per year. Regardless of the scenario that actually unfolds, this year's female postsecondary graduates may incur larger earnings losses during the next five years than their male counterparts. For example, if this year's youth unemployment rate is 28.0%, female bachelor's degree graduates may lose $43,674 over a five-year period, compared with $27,887 among their male counterparts. Higher education may help young people—those who choose to further their studies—to weather the economic storm. Although high school graduates may lose less in dollar earnings than postsecondary graduates, these potential losses represent a larger share of their earnings since high school graduates earn considerably less than postsecondary graduates on average. For example, under the worst case scenario examined in this study, male high school graduates may lose 19.9% in earnings, compared with 11.6% among their counterparts with a bachelor's degree.

The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was one of these programs. It provided financial support to employees and self-employed Canadians who had lost their job or were working fewer hours as a result of the pandemic. Canadian workers had to satisfy a number of criteria in order to be eligible for CERB. For example, they were required—among other things—to have had annual earnings of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application. Applicants received $2,000 for an initial four week period and could subsequently reapply for additional periods, eventually extending to 28 weeks, for a maximum benefit of $14,000. The program covered the period ranging from March 15 to September 26, 2020. Today, Statistics Canada provides a demographic and labour market profile of those Canadians who received CERB from March to September 2020. A more detailed analysis can be found in the StatCan COVID-19 study ""Workers receiving payments from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit program in 2020."" The focus is on workers who had significant earnings in the year prior to the onset of COVID-19, i.e., who earned at least $5,000 in 2019. Additional analyses of CERB and of other emergency government programs will be profiled in the coming months. Of all workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019, about one-third received CERB payments in 2020 Of all Canadian workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019, 35.2% received CERB payments for the period between March 15 and September 26, 2020. Women (36.3%) were more likely than men (34.2%) to receive CERB, reflecting the fact that they were more affected by the lockdowns than their male counterparts. Labour Force Survey data show that from March to September 2020, the total actual hours worked by women fell 16.3% from the same period a year earlier, compared with a 13.1% decline for men. Workers in industries hardest hit by the economic lockdowns and low-wage workers most likely to receive CERB payments In every province and territory, the percentage of workers receiving CERB payments was relatively high among low-wage workers and in industries that were severely affected by the economic lockdowns implemented in 2020. For example, roughly two-thirds (66.6%) of workers employed in accommodation and food services in 2019 received CERB payments in 2020, the highest rate among all sectors. The corresponding percentage for their counterparts employed in arts, entertainment, and recreation was 62.7%. By contrast, relatively few workers employed in utilities (7.0%) or public administration (11.7%) received CERB payments in 2020. These patterns are consistent with the changes in total actual work hours observed from the March-to-September 2019 period to the March-to-September 2020 period. During that time, the total actual work hours of workers employed in accommodation and food services or in arts, entertainment and recreation fell by 41.2% and 44.8%, respectively. At the other end of the spectrum, the total actual work hours of workers employed in utilities fell by 0.2% during that period, while those of workers employed in public administration fell by 1.7%. In line with the fact that the labour market downturn of 2020 disproportionately affected low-paid employees, workers with relatively low annual earnings were more likely to receive CERB than other workers. Of all workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019 and who were in the bottom 10% of the employment income distribution that year, more than half (55.3%) received CERB payments in 2020. By contrast, about 1 in 10 workers (11.3%) in the top 10% of the 2019 employment income distribution received CERB payments in 2020. Relatively high percentages of CERB recipients among young workers and in provinces hit hardest by the economic lockdowns As the COVID-19 pandemic substantially reduced employment in accommodation and food services and in arts, entertainment and recreation, young workers saw their total actual work hours drop significantly from the March-to-September 2019 period to the March-to-September 2020 period. During that period, the total hours actually worked by men aged 15 to 24 fell by 22.6%, while those worked by women in the same age group dropped by 27.7%. Meanwhile, the total work hours of men and women aged 35 to 44 fell by 10.1% and 13.6%, respectively. The percentages of CERB recipients observed across age groups reflect these employment patterns. Of all men aged 15 to 24, 50.4% received CERB payments in 2020, compared with 53.9% of women aged 15 to 24. By contrast, in the 35 to 44 age group, roughly one-third of men (31.2%) and of women (34.0%) received CERB payments in 2020. Likewise, workers living in regions most affected by the labour market downturn in 2020 were more likely to receive CERB. For example, the percentage of CERB recipients amounted to 37.7% in Quebec, 35.8% in Ontario, 34.8% in Alberta and 34.3% in British Columbia. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan — two provinces where total actual hours worked fell to a lesser extent — the percentage of CERB recipients amounted to 28.8% and 28.6%, respectively. The percentage of CERB recipients was even lower in Yukon (25.9%). In the Atlantic provinces, the percentage of workers receiving CERB varied between 31.5% (in New Brunswick) and 33.7% (in Newfoundland and Labrador). Visible minority workers were more likely to receive CERB Workers who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities were more vulnerable to the economic and health repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic than non-visible minorities for a variety of reasons. Canadians who belong to these population groups played a vital role on the front lines during the pandemic, with Black (12%) or Filipino (11%) workers alone accounting for almost one-quarter of all nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates nationally at the time of the 2016 Census. Two-fifths of all workers in meat processing plants belonged to a group designated as a visible minority in 2016, an industry that experienced repeated COVID-19 outbreaks and shutdowns in 2020. Visible minority workers were also overrepresented in accommodation and food services, one of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. In 2016, 30.1% of workers in this sector were visible minority workers, whereas in all economic sectors, they represented 20.8% of workers. Among workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019, approximately two-fifths of those designated as visible minorities (41.4%) received CERB from March to September 2020, compared with about one-third of those who were not a visible minority (32.0%). West Asian (50.8%), Southeast Asian (48.3%) and Arab (45.4%) workers were the most likely to receive CERB payments from March to September 2020, followed by Korean (43.3%), Black (43.0%) and Latino (41.8%) workers. Canadians who belong to population groups designated as a visible minorities were also more vulnerable than other Canadians to the economic shock of the lockdowns because they had lower median employment income before the pandemic. In 2015, the most recent year for which detailed disaggregated data by population group are available, West Asians ($21,516), Koreans ($22,913), Arabs ($23,253), Blacks ($26,807) and Latinos ($28,638) all had significantly lower median income than non-visible minority Canadians ($35,299) and they were also more likely to live in poverty. Indigenous workers more likely to receive CERB than non-Indigenous workers Previous research has highlighted the disproportionate social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indigenous people, including a greater impact on their ability to meet financial obligations or essential needs and a slower labour market recovery. First Nations (41.5%), Inuit (40.3%) and Métis (36.2%) workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019 were more likely to receive CERB from March to September 2020 than non-Indigenous people (33.9%). The higher percentage of CERB recipients among Indigenous workers reflect, in part, their overrepresentation in jobs that provide relatively low annual earnings. According to the 2016 Census, the median employment income of Inuit ($20,984), First Nations ($23,345) and Métis ($31,423) was less than that of non-Indigenous people ($34,013). The Indigenous population is also significantly younger than the non-Indigenous population which, given the greater percentage of CERB recipients among youth across Canada, also helps to explain the greater proportion of Indigenous workers who received CERB payments in 2020. Note to readers In March 2020, the federal government introduced emergency measures to provide temporary financial support to workers, students and businesses affected by the economic lockdowns triggered by COVID-19. These measures included the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), available to Canadians who had lost their job or were working reduced hours, the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, to assist businesses, including the self-employed, and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, to provide financial support to students. CERB was available to: individuals residing in Canada who were at least 15 years old; who had stopped working or had been working reduced hours because of COVID-19; who did not expect to earn over $1,000 in employment or self-employment income for at least 14 days in a row during a four week period; who had employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application; and who had not quit their job voluntarily. Because information on employment income in the 12 months prior to the date of application is not available and because information on employees who quit their job has yet to be integrated in the data, the focus of the analysis is on workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019. For the same reasons, the proportion of workers receiving the benefit shown in this release equal the percentage of workers who received CERB payments in 2020 among those who earned at least $5,000 in 2019. This percentage should be interpreted as a baseline statistic for workers in a given industry or group. It is not intended to represent workers who could have been eligible for CERB in the case of a job interruption. The CERB data highlighted in this release come from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and contain information on initial payments from both streams of the program, one administered by ESDC and the other by the Canada Revenue Agency on its behalf. Earnings in 2019 were gleaned from employee T4 slips and net self-employment income and eligible dividends reported on T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return forms. Main industry of employment was determined from the industry of activity of the business responsible for the most earnings in 2019. The immigrant status and period of immigration characteristics were obtained from the Longitudinal Immigration Database, which contains data on immigrants who landed in Canada from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2019. Other characteristics, such as Indigenous identity and visible minority status, were integrated from responses to the 2016 Census of Population. Information on CERB payments by Indigenous identity and visible minority status are therefore only available for respondents to the 2016 Census. So, the proportions presented for those groups do not include persons who were not in Canada at the time, nor those living on incompletely or partially enumerated reserves in 2016. In this release, ""Indigenous people"" refers to First Nations people, Métis and Inuit. The term ""First Nations people"" includes those living on and off reserve, and include both Status and non-Status Indians.

The total value of building permits remained at historically high levels in April 2021, edging down 0.5% to $11.1 billion, following the record set in March. The slight pullback was mainly due to declines in the residential sector in British Columbia and Quebec, which outweighed national gains in the non-residential sector. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits were largely unchanged (-0.0%). Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, April 2021 Residential sector remains strong despite decrease in April In the residential sector, the value of building permits fell 6.7% to $7.7 billion in April. Despite the decrease, this was the second highest value on record. British Columbia (-23.7%) and Quebec (-14.9%) accounted for most of this decline. The value of building permits for multi-family dwellings dropped 6.5% to $4.1 billion. Gains in Ontario and Alberta were not enough to offset decreases in British Columbia and Quebec, where several large permits had been issued (in both provinces) during the previous month. Eight provinces reported a decline in the value of permits issued for single-family dwellings, with the national total down 7.0% to $3.6 billion, mainly as a result of fewer new projects in Ontario and Quebec. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Commercial and institutional components boost the non-residential sector Commercial permits surged 28.7% to $1.9 billion in April. A $97 million permit for the Sick Kids patient support centre in the city of Toronto and an $80 million permit for the Centennial Community and Aquatics Centre in the city of New Westminster were among several large permits that were issued in the month. In contrast, the largest commercial permit issued nationwide in March was valued at $43 million and was for a warehouse in the city of Pickering. The value of institutional permits increased 23.1% to $910 million, led by Quebec (+135.7%), which rebounded from a 53.6% drop the previous month. Quebec issued numerous large permits in April, such as for a new hospital in the city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu ($56 million) and for a new seniors' care centre in the city of Belœil ($43 million). The value of industrial permits fell 13.2% in April to $592 million. Ontario (-36.5%) accounted for most of the decrease, as fewer permits for large projects were issued in the province compared with the previous month. Overall, the value of building permits in the non-residential sector climbed 17.4% to $3.4 billion.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates have been made available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month has been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for May will be released on July 2.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.1% in March, following 0.4% growth in February. This 11th consecutive monthly increase continued to offset the steepest drops in Canadian economic activity on record observed in March and April 2020. However, total economic activity was about 1% below the level observed in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product grows in March Both goods-producing (+1.1%) and services-producing (+1.1%) industries were up, as 18 of 20 industrial sectors posted increases in March. Preliminary information indicates an approximate 0.8% decline in real GDP in April, the first decline since April 2020. Declines in retail trade and accommodation and food services reflect in part additional public health measures in some parts of the country. There are also notable declines in manufacturing, real estate and rental and leasing, and educational services. Owing to its preliminary nature, this estimate will be revised on June 30 with the release of the official GDP data for April. Retailing up on favourable conditions Retail trade increased 3.7% in March, following a 5.9% jump in February, as 10 of 12 subsectors were up. Chart 2 Retail trade grows in March Activity at building material and garden equipment and supplies retailers jumped 15.3% in March as the continued easing of restrictions and temperatures above the seasonal average in some parts of the country contributed to the growth. Clothing and clothing accessories retailing also posted a strong increase (+18.6%) in March, following a 34.1% jump in February. Sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+7.4%), furniture and home furnishings stores (+5.1%), and other traditional brick-and-mortar stores benefited from regulations permitting in-store shopping. Food and beverage stores (-0.9%) and gasoline stations (-0.8%) offset some of the gains. Strength in construction continues Construction rose 2.2% in March, building up on increases in the previous three months, as all subsectors were up. The residential building construction subsector contributed the most to the growth, with a 4.1% expansion in March, as all types of construction activities were up. Single-family home construction and alterations and improvements led the expansion, as strong demand continued into March. With the exception of November (-0.3%), the subsector has been continuously growing since May 2020. Repair construction increased 1.8% in March, while non-residential building construction rose 1.3%, as all components increased. Engineering and other construction activities also grew (+0.3%). Wholesale trade grows Wholesale trade increased 1.8% in March, more than offsetting the 1.4% decline in February, as eight of nine subsectors were up. Building material and supplies wholesaling contributed the most to the growth, with a 5.6% increase in March, benefiting from heightened demand for products both domestically and internationally. Machinery, equipment and supplies wholesaling rose 1.0%, as activity in the majority of industries in the subsector increased. Only farm product wholesaling (-4.2%) was down in the month. The public sector continues to grow The public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) grew 0.8% in March, as all three components were up. Educational services rose 1.6% in March, driven by a 2.9% gain at elementary and secondary schools. In 2021, the Government of Ontario moved the annual spring break from mid-March to mid-April to limit the spread of COVID-19. This decision resulted in an atypical increase in output from the extra week of classes in March. Health care and social assistance rose 0.7%, led by ambulatory health care services (+1.7%), while public administration grew 0.3% in March. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction increases Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction grew 1.9% in March, largely offsetting the 2.4% decline in February, as all three subsectors were up. Oil and gas extraction, up for the sixth time in seven months, increased 1.6% in March. Oil sands extraction was up 0.6%, led by crude bitumen extraction in Alberta. Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) increased 2.8%, as both crude petroleum and natural gas extraction were up. Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) rose 2.9% in March, more than offsetting the 1.3% decline in February, as export-driven increases in metal ore mining led the growth. Indeed, the latter industry rose 5.8%, as copper, nickel, lead and zinc ore mining (+6.9%), iron ore mining (+6.1%), and gold and silver ore mining (+4.7%) all recorded growth. Non-metallic mineral mining declined (-0.7%) for a third month in a row, mainly because of a fall in diamond mining. Coal mining was down for the first time in 10 months, decreasing 3.0% in March. Support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction grew 0.5% in March, attributable to higher rigging services. Accommodation and food services are up Accommodation and food services rose 5.0% in March, led by an 11.1% increase in accommodation services. Starting late February, all travellers entering Canada by air, regardless of citizenship, have been required to follow testing and quarantine measures, with a mandatory stopover at a government-authorized hotel at the travellers' expense, resulting in an uptick in activity. Food services and drinking places were up for a third consecutive month, rising 2.9% in March. Professional services keep growing Professional services expanded 1.0% in March as the majority of industries were up. Contributing the most to the growth were computer systems design and related services (+0.9%) and other professional, scientific and technical services, including scientific research and development services (+1.1%). Legal services, which derive much of their activity from real estate transactions, grew 1.2% in March. Continued increases in home resale activity in Ontario and Western Canada pushed the level of activity at offices of real estate agents and brokers (+2.6%) to yet another all-time high. Chart 3 Activities at offices of real estate agents and brokers grow in March Other industries The manufacturing sector grew 0.5% in March, as an increase in durable manufacturing (+1.4%) more than offset a contraction in non-durable manufacturing (-0.6%). Transportation services rose 1.3% in March, after declining in the previous two months, as the majority of subsectors were up. Truck transportation (+2.3%), support activities for transportation (+1.3%) and rail transportation (+1.2%) contributed the most to the growth. Utilities were down 1.0%, as electric power generation, transmission and distribution (-0.6%) and natural gas distribution (-4.8%) decreased in March. Finance and insurance edged up 0.2%. Increases in financial investment services, funds and other financial vehicles (+1.3%) and depository credit intermediation and monetary authorities (+0.2%) offset declines in non-depository credit intermediation and activities related to credit intermediation (-0.3%) and insurance carriers and related activities (-0.3%). Chart 4 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product First quarter of 2021 Economic activity continued to grow in the first quarter of 2021. Overall, 15 of 20 sectors recorded gains in the quarter as both goods-producing (+2.2%) and services-producing (+1.4%) industries were up. This third consecutive quarterly increase continued to offset the historic drop in output in the second quarter of 2020. Construction expanded for a third consecutive quarter, rising 3.8% in the quarter, as most types of construction activity were up. Residential building construction jumped 7.6%, as all components increased, led by single-family home construction and home alterations and improvements. Repair construction (+3.5%) and engineering and other construction activities (+0.9%) rose, while non-residential building construction remained unchanged (0.0%). Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction increased 5.5%, as all subsectors recorded growth. Mining and quarrying (excluding oil and gas) expanded 9.1%, as metal ore (+9.8%), non-metallic mineral (+6.4%) and coal (+11.3%) mining were all up in the first quarter. Oil and gas extraction grew 2.4%, led by a 4.4% increase in oil sands extraction activity. Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) edged up 0.1%, as a decline in crude petroleum extraction was more than offset by higher natural gas production. The largest contributor to the increase in the services-producing industries was a 2.1% rise in the public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration), as all three components rose. Health care and social assistance grew 2.8%, driven by ambulatory health care services (+5.2%) and hospitals (+1.1%). Public administration rose 1.8%, while educational services were up 1.7% in the quarter. The real estate and rental and leasing sector rose 1.3% as increases in the majority of subsectors contributed to the growth. Continued strong home resale activity in many markets across the country pushed activity at the offices of real estate agents and brokers (+8.4%) to record-high levels in the first quarter of 2021. The professional, scientific and technical services sector increased 2.2% in the first quarter, up for the third consecutive quarter. Legal, accounting and related services (+3.0%) and computer systems design and related services (+2.3%) led growth in the sector. Retail trade rose 1.5% in the first quarter of 2021. The continued lifting and easing of lockdown measures in the latter part of the quarter, in many parts of the country, contributed to the sector's growth, as activity increased at non-essential retailers. Building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+8.1%), non-store retailers (+9.3%) and general merchandise stores (+3.4%) led the growth. The finance and insurance sector rose 1.0% in the first quarter of 2021 and has grown for eight consecutive quarters. Depository credit intermediation and monetary authorities (+0.8%), financial investment services, funds and other financial vehicles (+2.2%) and insurance carriers and related activities (+1.2%) were all up. Chart 5 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product, first quarter Table 1 Monthly gross domestic product by industry at basic prices in chained (2012) dollars – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Quarterly gross domestic product by industry at basic prices in chained (2012) dollars – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The release on gross domestic product by industry is an example of how Statistics Canada supports global sustainable development goal reporting. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Monthly data on gross domestic product (GDP) by industry at basic prices are chained volume estimates with 2012 as the reference year. This means that the data for each industry and each aggregate are obtained from a chained volume index multiplied by the industry's value added in 2012. The monthly data are benchmarked to annually chained Fisher volume indexes of GDP obtained from the constant-price supply and use tables (SUTs) up to the latest SUT year (2017). For the period starting in January 2018, data are derived by chaining a fixed-weight Laspeyres volume index to the prior period. The fixed weights are 2017 industry prices. This approach makes the monthly GDP by industry data more comparable with expenditure-based GDP data, which are chained quarterly. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. An advance estimate of industrial production for April 2021 is available upon request. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Revisions With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions have been made back to January 2020. Each month, newly available administrative and survey data from various industries in the economy are integrated, resulting in statistical revisions. Updated and revised administrative data (including taxation statistics), new information provided by respondents to industry surveys, and standard changes to seasonal adjustment calculations are incorporated with each release. Real-time table Real-time table 36-10-0491-01 will be updated on June 14, 2021. Next release Data on GDP by industry for April 2021 will be released on June 30, 2021.

Retail sales — Nvt. $45.4 millions March 2021 -2.0% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 20-10-0008-01. Retail sales were up 3.6% to $57.6 billion in March, led by higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and clothing and clothing accessories stores. Sales at food and beverage stores declined. Sales increased in 10 of 11 subsectors, representing 79.1% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude sales at gasoline stations, and motor vehicle and parts dealers—rose 4.7%. In volume terms, retail sales increased 3.2% in March. Retail sales were up 1.8% in the first quarter—the third consecutive quarterly increase. In volume terms, quarterly sales were up 0.5%. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. Based on respondent feedback, 2.1% of retailers were closed at some point in March. The average length of the closure was less than one day. This represented a widespread reopening of the economy between the second and third waves of the pandemic. In February, 12.0% of retailers were closed for an average of two days. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 5.1% in April. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 46% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 90.7%. Chart 1 Retail sales increase in March Core retail sales rise as stores reopen Core retail sales rose for the second consecutive month, up 4.7% in March on higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (+19.8%). This was the largest increase since May 2020 and coincided with warmer-than-typical March weather and the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in some areas of the country. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores rose for the second straight month, up 23.6% in March, to their highest level since the beginning of the pandemic. The increase in March is attributable to higher sales at clothing stores (+25.0%) and shoe stores (+42.8%). Sales at jewellery, luggage and leather goods stores edged down 0.1%. In March, 5.1% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of one day; in February, 38.8% were closed for an average of six days. The lone decline in March was at food and beverage stores (-1.3%), where sales decreased for the third time in four months on lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores (-1.6%) and specialty food stores (-12.0%). These declines were partially offset by higher sales at beer, wine and liquor stores (+3.1%). Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations rise for the third consecutive month Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased for the third consecutive month, up 1.4% in March. The growth is mostly attributable to higher sales at other motor vehicle dealers (+11.8%) and new car dealers (+0.7%). Sales at gasoline stations also increased for the third month in a row, rising 1.8% in March on higher gasoline prices. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations declined 0.8%. Chart 2 Sales up in 10 of 11 subsectors Sales up in six provinces Sales were up in six provinces in March, with Ontario accounting for the majority of the increase. In Ontario, sales rose 9.0% on higher sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores, and building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers. This was the largest monthly increase in Ontario since June 2020, when sales were up 32.3%. Sales rose 6.8% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, coinciding with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Quebec (+2.2%) posted the second-largest provincial increase, on higher sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and general merchandise stores. In the CMA of Montréal, sales were up 4.1%. Retail e-commerce in Canada On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 58.5% year over year to $3.7 billion in March, accounting for 6.3% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales fell 0.7 percentage points in March as more brick-and-mortar stores were allowed to open their doors to in-person shopping. On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 1.5% in March. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes. Real-time tables Real-time tables 20-10-0054-01 and 20-10-0079-01 will be updated soon. Next release Data on retail trade for April will be released on June 23.

Total investment in building construction increased 5.9% to $18.6 billion in March, led by the residential sector. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction was up 5.2% to $14.3 billion in March. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Residential investment continues to set records Residential construction investment increased for the eleventh consecutive month, up 7.6% to $14.0 billion in March. Investment in single units jumped 10.7% to $7.8 billion. Quebec led the way with an increase of 30.4%, bringing investment in single homes to $1.9 billion for the province. Investment in Ontario was up 9.8% to $3.3 billion, driven by renovations to single family homes in the census metropolitan area of Toronto. Growth in multi-unit construction continued, up 3.9% to $6.2 billion. Gains in Quebec and Ontario led the overall increase in this component, as six provinces reported declines. Both new construction and renovations of condominiums and apartments in the cities of Toronto and Montréal accounted for most of the growth. Infographic 1 Investment in residential building construction, March 2021 Non-residential investment increases slightly Non-residential construction investment rose 1.1% to $4.6 billion in March, with all components posting slight increases. Despite this gain, the commercial and industrial investment components were below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Institutional construction investment was up 2.2% to $1.2 billion. Multiple high-value projects in Montréal contributed to a 2.6% increase in Quebec, where investment totalled $315 million in March. Investments in the province included a new elementary school in Laval and renovations to a secondary school in Montréal. British Columbia recorded another strong month in March, with the continued construction of new schools in Burnaby, North Vancouver and Vancouver. Commercial building construction rose 0.8% to $2.6 billion. Six provinces recorded slight gains, led by Ontario and Alberta. Large office building renovation projects in Edmonton and Calgary contributed to the 1.7% gain in Alberta in this component. Investment in industrial construction edged up 0.4% to $823 million in March. Increases in Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec offset six provincial declines. Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in non-residential building construction, March 2021 Residential investment drives first quarter of the year The total value of investment in building construction rose 9.3% to $53.1 billion in the first quarter, stemming from continued strength in the residential sector (+12.4%). Investment for residential buildings reached $39.5 billion, largely because of increased spending on single units in Ontario (+21.8%) and Quebec (+24.9%). Non-residential investment rose 1.1% to $13.6 billion in the first quarter, following a 6.0% decline in the previous quarter. Institutional construction advanced 3.0% in the first quarter, driven by strength in British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador, which recorded their highest levels for this component since the start of the series in 2010. Nova Scotia jumped 55.0%, reporting the highest quarterly value since the third quarter of 2014. Investment in commercial construction advanced slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, with the gain largely due to strength in Ontario. However, investment in this component was below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, down 13.8% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The industrial component edged down 0.2%, largely as a result of declines in Alberta. For more information on housing, please visit the Housing Statistics Portal. Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. As per Statistics Canada practices, data for the previous year have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous three years have also been revised. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted with current dollar values unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates in constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (Table 18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to the structure type ""single."" Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage. Effective November 23, 2018, Table 34-10-0175-01 contains data on both the residential and the non-residential sectors. It replaced tables 34-10-0010-01, 34-10-0011-01 and 34-10-0012-01. Next release Data on investment in building construction for April will be released on June 10. Products A study titled ""Price trends and outlook in key Canadian housing markets"" looks at where the housing market was at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, sheds light on what has happened since then and explores the challenges facing the Canadian market going forward.

Raw Materials Price Index, excluding crude energy products April 2021 3.4% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 18-10-0268-01. Prices for products manufactured in Canada, as measured by the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI), rose 1.6% month over month in April and 14.3% compared with April 2020. Prices of raw materials purchased by manufacturers operating in Canada, as measured by the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI), increased 1.0% on a monthly basis in April and 56.4% compared with April 2020. Chart 1 Prices for industrial products increase Industrial Product Price Index The IPPI (+1.6%) posted its fifth consecutive monthly increase in April. Excluding energy and petroleum products, the IPPI was up 1.8%. Of the 21 major commodity groups, 18 were up and 3 were down. The increase in the IPPI was driven mostly by higher prices for lumber and other wood products (+6.4%), which have been on the rise since December 2020. Steadily increasing prices for softwood lumber (+10.1%) led this growth. Over one year, softwood lumber prices have climbed 169.4%, their largest year-over-year increase in history. Persistent demand for softwood lumber in the United States and Canada for construction and residential renovations, combined with lower supply, drove this category upward. Prices for meat, fish and dairy products (+4.1%) also contributed significantly to the gain in the IPPI, mainly as a result of higher prices for fresh and frozen beef and veal (+17.0%) and, to a lesser extent, fresh and frozen pork (+7.3%). High domestic demand for red meat and strong exports were the main reasons for the higher prices for meats. Primary ferrous metal product prices (+2.9%) rose for the eighth consecutive month in April, pulled upward by hot-rolled iron and steel products (+3.4%), and iron and steel pipes and tubes (except castings; +11.0%). Prices for chemicals and chemical products were up 1.5% in April, following a 3.6% increase in March. Much of this gain was led by continuing price increases in plastic resins, which rose 7.8% from the previous month and 50.5% year over year. Petrochemicals (+1.5%) and chemical products not elsewhere classified (+3.7%) also pushed this commodity group upward, albeit to a lesser extent. Among the other product groups that rose in April were pulp and paper products (+3.6%) and fruit, vegetables, feeds and other food products (+1.4%). The gain in the pulp and paper product group was widespread, but wood pulp (+7.1%) was mostly responsible for the higher prices in this group. The gain observed in fruit, vegetables, feeds and other food products was driven by higher prices for grain and oilseed products not elsewhere classified (+5.7%) and margarine and cooking oils (+8.4%). Year over year, the IPPI was up 14.3%, its ninth consecutive increase and the strongest gain since February 1980 (+15.3%). Prices for energy and petroleum products (+78.4%) led this increase. The increase in prices for energy and petroleum products was pronounced because it followed a sharp decline in prices observed in April 2020, which was mainly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lumber and other wood products (+88.8%) and primary non-ferrous metal products (+30.0%) were also important factors in the IPPI's year-over-year increase. Raw Materials Price Index The RMPI increased 1.0% in April, after posting a 2.2% gain in March. This was its seventh consecutive monthly gain. Of the six major commodity groups, five were up and one was down. The RMPI excluding crude energy products (+3.4%) grew at a stronger pace, mostly from higher prices for animals and animal products (+8.7%). Prices for fish, crustaceans, shellfish and other fishery products (+33.1%) were the biggest contributor to the advance in this commodity group. This gain was primarily because of high demand for lobster and snow crab. Prices for hogs (+11.9%) and cattle and calves (+4.3%) also contributed significantly to higher prices for animals and animal products. Crop products prices rose 3.4%, led by higher prices for canola (+5.3%), which continued their upward movement that began in March 2020. Year over year, canola prices climbed 82.3%, their strongest gain since June 1984 (+90.6%). Prices for grains except wheat (+5.2%) and oilseeds except canola (+2.6%) also rose over March. The growth in the RMPI was mostly moderated by crude energy product prices, which fell 3.2% after five consecutive months of increase. Lower prices for conventional crude oil (-2.8%) and synthetic crude oil (-5.7%) were the main contributors to this decrease. A number of factors had a dampening effect on oil prices in April, including the decision of member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus to boost their production for the next three months, the uncertainty generated by a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some Asian and European countries, and the reopening of the Suez Canal. Despite a decline in crude energy product prices in April, prices were 253.3% higher than in the same month in 2020. This increase was pronounced because it followed a large drop in prices observed in April 2020, caused mostly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Year over year, the RMPI rose 56.4%, the largest increase since the start of this series in 1981. All six major commodity groups were up, compared with April 2020, but it was mostly crude energy products that pushed the RMPI upward. Chart 2 Prices for raw materials rise Table 1 Industrial Product Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Table 2 Raw Materials Price Index – Not seasonally adjusted Note to readers The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) and the Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) are available at the Canada level only. Selected commodity groups within the IPPI are also available by region. With each release, data for the previous six months may have been revised. The indexes are not seasonally adjusted. The Industrial Product Price Index reflects the prices that producers in Canada receive as goods leave the plant gate. The IPPI does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike the Consumer Price Index, the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and all costs that occur between the time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user takes possession of the good. This includes transportation, wholesale and retail costs. Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars, and these prices are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp and paper products, and wood products. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US counterpart affect the IPPI. However, the conversion to Canadian dollars reflects only how respondents provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes into account the full effect of exchange rates. The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on the average monthly exchange rate established by the Bank of Canada and available in Table 33-10-0163-01 (series v111666275). Monthly and annual variations in the exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for example, CAN$1 = US$X). The Raw Materials Price Index reflects the prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI. Products Statistics Canada launched the Producer price indexes portal as part of a suite of portals for prices and price indexes. This web page provides Canadians with a single point of access to a variety of statistics and measures related to producer prices. The video Producer Price Indexes is available on the Statistics Canada Training Institute web page. It provides an introduction to Statistics Canada's producer price indexes—what they are, how they are made and what they are used for. Next release The industrial product and raw materials price indexes for May will be released on June 30, 2021.

This 10th consecutive monthly increase continued to offset the steepest drops in Canadian economic activity on record in March and April 2020. However, total economic activity was about 2% below the level observed in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout April 2021, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. The survey collects information on business expectations moving forward and the ongoing impact of the pandemic on businesses in Canada. Over the next three months, one-third of businesses expected their profitability to decrease, one-quarter expected their sales to decrease, one-fifth expected to increase the prices they charge and three-quarters expected their number of employees to remain the same. Businesses were concerned with future survival and expected to face a variety of obstacles in the short term. Many businesses anticipate lower profitability in the short term Over one-third (37.1%) of all businesses and over half (51.6%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expected their profitability to decrease over the next three months (see note to readers). Conversely, 12.4% of businesses expected their profitability to increase, most notably, those in wholesale trade (19.4%), manufacturing (18.0%) and retail trade (17.0%). Just over one-quarter (25.7%) of businesses expected their sales to decrease over the next three months, down from nearly one-third of businesses last quarter. Businesses in accommodation and food services (42.1%) were most likely to expect sales to fall. Nearly one-fifth (19.9%) of businesses expected to raise prices over the next three months, up from 14.0% last cycle, with those in manufacturing (33.9%), wholesale trade (33.7%) and construction (31.0%) most likely to expect to do so. Over three-quarters (77.6%) of businesses expected their number of employees to remain the same over the next three months, up from 70.6% last cycle. Conversely, 8.8% of businesses expected their number of employees to decrease, down from 11.7% last quarter. Over one-fifth (20.5%) of businesses in accommodation and food services expected a reduction in their number of employees over the next three months, down from 29.6% last quarter. In terms of vacant positions, 6.8% of businesses expected to have more job vacancies over the next three months. In accommodation and food services, 13.4% of businesses expected to have more vacant positions. Business survival and plans over the next year Over two-thirds (68.5%) of businesses reported they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for 12 months or more before considering closure or bankruptcy. Similar to last quarter, almost 1 in 10 (9.5%) businesses reported they could continue for less than 12 months. Under one-quarter of businesses in accommodation and food services (22.8%) reported they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before having to consider closure or bankruptcy, down from 24.9% of businesses last quarter. Over three-fifths (61.6%) of businesses reported they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for 12 months or more before considering laying off staff, while just over one-fifth (20.7%) reported they could continue for less than 12 months before considering laying off staff. Businesses in accommodation and food services (38.4%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (29.4%) were most likely to report they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before considering laying off staff. One in eight businesses (12.1%) had plans to expand or restructure, or had plans to acquire or invest in other businesses in the next year. Similar to last cycle, 2.9% of businesses had plans to transfer or sell their business within the next year. Meanwhile, 1.3% of businesses had plans to close their business, down from 2.4% of businesses last quarter. Three-quarters (75.0%) of businesses had the cash or liquid assets required to operate over the next three months. While two-fifths (42.9%) of businesses reported that they did not need to take on more debt, 14.8% of businesses reported that they could not take on more debt. Of businesses that could not take on more debt, the most commonly reported reasons were lack of confidence or uncertainty in future sales (56.2%), cash flow (47.2%) and expectations that the request would be turned down (22.0%). Just over one-quarter (25.3%) of businesses in accommodation and food services and over one-fifth (23.6%) of businesses in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction reported that they did not have the ability to take on more debt. Businesses expect to face a variety of obstacles During these uncertain times, businesses are faced with a variety of obstacles and future unknowns. The rising cost of inputs, including labour, capital, energy and raw materials, was the most commonly expected obstacle over the next three months (37.8%), up from 25.5% of businesses that expected this to be an obstacle last quarter. The rising cost of inputs was expected to be an obstacle for around three-fifths of businesses in construction (62.1%), agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (62.0%), and manufacturing (59.2%). Businesses expected to face obstacles related to the workforce. Recruiting skilled employees was expected to be an obstacle for over one-quarter (27.8%) of all businesses, led by businesses in manufacturing (39.1%), construction (35.2%), retail trade (32.4%), and accommodation and food services (32.3%). In addition, shortage of labour force (23.8%) and retaining skilled employees (22.1%) were expected obstacles for over one-fifth of businesses. Over one-quarter (27.8%) of businesses expected attracting new or returning customers to be an obstacle over the next three months. It was expected to be an obstacle for over two-fifths of businesses in information and cultural industries (43.2%), accommodation and food services (42.6%), and arts, entertainment and recreation (41.4%). Businesses shift to increase online sales capabilities The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with temporary store closures and physical distancing measures, prompted many Canadian retailers to open or expand their e-commerce presence, quickly changing the retail landscape. Retail e-commerce rose from 3.5% of total retail sales in 2019 to 5.9% in 2020. In December alone, online sales were up by over two-thirds (+69.3%) year over year to $4.7 billion. In addition to efforts made by businesses to increase e-commerce capabilities over the past year, businesses planned to continue to make such investments. Just over one-fifth (20.1%) of all businesses were likely to invest in online sales or e-commerce capabilities over the next 12 months. Businesses in information and cultural industries (41.8%), retail trade (37.8%), and wholesale trade (36.1%) were most likely to invest in online sales or e-commerce capabilities over the next 12 months. Almost one-fifth (18.6%) of businesses reported they were likely going to permanently increase their online sales capacity once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Businesses in retail trade (37.0%) and wholesale trade (34.3%) were most likely to report permanently increasing their online sales capacity once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. The availability of 5G wireless technology is expected to have a moderate or major impact on 16.2% of businesses, led by businesses in information and cultural industries (27.5%). Table 1 Expected obstacles to businesses or organizations over the next three months, by selected industries, second quarter of 2021 Note to readers Data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions are now available. The tables provide data at the national, provincial and territorial level by industrial sector, by employment size, by type of business and by majority ownership. Data are also available for the 20 largest cities in Canada, by request. Data in this release are from Statistics Canada's Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. Results from this survey are applicable to employer businesses in Canada. This survey is carried out on a quarterly basis to collect information from businesses in Canada more efficiently and rapidly compared with traditional survey methods. The most recent survey was conducted from April 1 to May 6, 2021, and respondents were asked what their expectations would be over the next three-month period. As a result, those three months could range from April 1 to August 6, 2021, depending on when the business responded. This survey collected data from businesses on the current economic situation and will be used to effectively assess their needs for the implementation of support measures both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistics Canada would like to thank Canadians who took the time to answer questions for this survey at this time and enable a more robust understanding of COVID-19's impact on Canadian businesses and the economy.

Lower- and middle-income earners recorded the largest annual increases in disposable income, as government COVID-19 support measures outpaced losses in compensation of employees and self-employment mixed income. As a result, the gap between the lowest- and highest-income households, calculated as the difference between their respective shares of total disposable income, shrank 1.9 percentage points in 2020 compared with 2019. The economic well-being of the lowest-income earners increased more than that of any other households in 2020, with those in the lowest income quintile recording gains of 17.6% in disposable income and 10.7% in net worth relative to 2019. Gains in net worth for the lowest-income earners were driven by larger percentage increases in real estate assets that outpaced increases in mortgage debt. Households in the lowest income quintile reduced their non-mortgage debt by more than other households, also contributing to their larger percentage gain in net worth in 2020. Despite fourth-quarter declines, household income up in 2020 Disposable income declined for most households in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the largest losses for the lowest-income earners (-10.2%). Despite declines at the end of the year, lower- and middle-income households recorded the largest increases in disposable income, rising by 13.0% to 17.6% in 2020 compared with 2019. The overall gains were led by unprecedented increases in current transfers in the second quarter, as governments' COVID-19 support measures were implemented to help mitigate negative impacts from the pandemic. If the government had not provided financial support to households, their disposable income would still have increased in 2020, but to a much lesser extent. Excluding the COVID-19 support measures, the lowest-income and youngest households would have seen the smallest gain in disposable income. This is because the COVID-19 support measures had a larger overall impact on the disposable income of the lowest-income and youngest earners in Canada, representing 9% to 14% of their total income in 2020. It is important to note that this analysis only estimates the direct impact of government transfers on household disposable income. It does not take into consideration any indirect impacts that government support measures had on household economic or financial well-being. These include the potential effects of economic scarring in the absence of such measures, including an increased incidence of job loss or insolvencies. Chart 1 Change in household disposable income, by income quintile, 2020 Chart 2 Change in household disposable income, by age group, 2020 Lowest-income and youngest households see largest wage losses in 2020 In contrast to disposable income, compensation of employees—of which wages and salaries make up the largest share—was up in the fourth quarter, with lower-income and older households (65 years and older) recording the biggest gains. Despite the uptick in the second half of the year, compensation of employees was lower in 2020 compared with 2019 for all households. The most pronounced wage losses were experienced by the lowest-income (-5.3%) and the youngest (-3.1%) households, as many people in these households work in industries or jobs hard hit by the pandemic. Employment Insurance benefits rise in fourth quarter as COVID-19 support measures ease In fall 2020, the federal government modified Employment Insurance (EI) eligibility and implemented three new COVID-19 support measures to provide financial assistance to households unable to qualify for EI. The result of these changes was a decline in COVID-19-specific support measures and a significant rise in EI benefits in the fourth quarter of 2020. While all households recorded notable increases in EI benefits in the fourth quarter, those younger than 45 had the largest uptick. Despite rebound in the second half of the year, household spending down and net saving up in 2020 Household spending rose as pandemic restrictions continued to ease in the fourth quarter, with lower-income and older households (65 years and older) posting the largest increases. Despite the uptick in the second half of the year, overall consumption expenditure was down in 2020 compared with 2019. The youngest and highest-income earners recorded the biggest declines, reducing their consumption expenditure by 5.7% and 7.0%, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2020, net saving for many households declined as their disposable income decreased and consumption edged up. The only households to record gains in net saving in the fourth quarter were the highest-income earners and those with a major income earner aged 35 to 44 years. Although net saving declined for many at the end of the year, all households recorded improved net saving in 2020 compared with 2019. Middle-income households experienced some of the biggest gains as they switched to a net saving position in 2020 from a net dissaving position in 2019. Chart 3 Household average net saving, by income quintile, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020 Chart 4 Household average net saving, by age group, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020 Lowest-income earners see their wealth increase the most throughout the year, because of gains in real estate Household wealth reached $12.8 trillion as of the fourth quarter of 2020, up $461 billion from the third quarter, with each disposable income quintile growing at roughly the same pace (about +4.0%) over that period. Throughout the year, wealth grew more for the lowest-income earners (+10.7%) compared with the highest-income earners (+9.0%), mainly because of consistently higher gains in real estate. Chart 5 Change in household net worth, by income quintile, including contribution of each wealth component, fourth quarter 2020 relative to fourth quarter 2019 Lower-income households increase their mortgage debt the most throughout the year, while they rely less on non-mortgage debt to finance consumer goods purchases While fourth-quarter growth in mortgage debt was similar for all households (roughly +2% relative to the third quarter of 2020), lower-income households increased their mortgage debt obligations the most throughout the year (by more than 7% relative to the fourth quarter of 2019), along with higher increases in the value of their real estate acquisitions. After business shutdowns were eased in the latter half of the year, all households increased their acquisition of consumer goods, such as cars, electronics and appliances. While lower-income households increased their non-mortgage debt to purchase consumer goods in the fourth quarter, the highest-income earners avoided additional borrowing. Households in the three lowest income quintiles collectively accounted for 83.8% of the $1.6 billion increase in non-mortgage debt in the fourth quarter. However, for the entire year, all households decreased their non-mortgage debt obligations, especially the lowest-income earners (-1.6%). Younger households increase their wealth by more than older households as gains in real estate and consumer goods purchases outpace increases in debt Although households with a major income earner younger than 35 held the least wealth of any age group, they saw their average net worth increase by more than that of older households. Similar to trends earlier in the year, which were driven by gains in value in the acquisition of real estate that outpaced growth in mortgage debt obligations, the net worth of households with a major income earner younger than 35 rose 4.5% in the fourth quarter, while net worth for those with a major income earner aged 55 or older grew by 3.6%. Chart 6 Quarterly change in net worth, by age group of household major income earner, indexed to fourth quarter 2019 Along with continued low mortgage lending rates offered by financial institutions as a result of the pandemic, younger households increased their mortgage debt by more than older households in the fourth quarter. Average mortgage debt for households with a major income earner younger than 35 rose 3.5% in the fourth quarter, while all other age groups increased their mortgage debt by less than 2% relative to the previous quarter. As well, households with a major income earner younger than 35 increased their holdings of consumer goods by 2.8% in the fourth quarter, more than double the rate of any other age group. However, most of these purchases were financed through savings or debt consolidation rather than through additional borrowing—the non-mortgage debt of households with a major income earner younger than 35 grew 1.3% in the same quarter. Debt-to-income ratio grows most for lower-income earners and younger households, but remains below pre-pandemic levels The debt-to-income ratio increased the most for households in the lowest income quintile, reaching 259.5% in the fourth quarter (up 30.3 percentage points from the third quarter), and for those younger than 35 years, reaching 199.9% (up 8.6 percentage points). While mortgage debt continued to grow in the fourth quarter, increases in employment earnings were offset by reductions in pandemic-related government benefits. Despite fourth-quarter increases, households' debt-to-income ratios remained below pre-pandemic levels. As the effects of the pandemic continue to filter through the economy, upcoming quarterly releases on the distributions of household economic accounts will shed further light on the evolution of household economic well-being throughout the 2021 reference year and beyond. Table 1 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Table 2 Income, consumption and saving, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Table 3 Net worth, average value per household, by income quintile, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Table 4 Net worth, average value per household, by age group of major income earner, 2019 to fourth quarter 2020, Canada Note to readers Statistics Canada regularly publishes macroeconomic indicators on household disposable income, final consumption expenditure, net saving and wealth as part of the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (CSMA). These accounts are aligned with the most recent international standards and are compiled for all sectors of the economy, including households, non-profit institutions, governments and corporations, along with Canada's financial position vis-à-vis the rest of the world. While the CSMA provides high-quality information on the overall position of households relative to other economic sectors, the distributions of household economic accounts (DHEA) provide additional granularity to address questions such as vulnerabilities of specific groups and the resulting implications for economic well-being and financial stability. They are therefore an important complement to standard quarterly outputs related to the economy. The quarterly DHEA estimates released today are experimental estimates of income, consumption, saving and wealth and their sub-components by various household distributions for 2020. Estimates for the first to the third quarters have been revised to include the latest CSMA benchmarks, as well as new microdata on household income, consumption and wealth. As with all data, these experimental quarterly DHEA estimates are not without their limitations. For the most part, these experimental data rely on the same concepts and methods as the annual DHEA. However, to produce the DHEA on a quarterly basis, new data sources were used and assumptions were made. DHEA estimates for wages and salaries were derived using Statistics Canada's Social Policy Simulation Database and Model, which incorporate data from the Labour Force Survey for employment by industry and wage level. The distributions of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit were aligned with microdata from Employment and Social Development Canada. Aggregate data on DHEA liabilities were distributed to household groups using sub-aggregate data purchased from a consumer credit rating agency. Because of scarcity in available microdata sources, aggregate estimates of DHEA household final consumption expenditure and household assets were allocated according to the DHEA distributions for reference year 2019. In an effort to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic well-being of households in Canada, these experimental DHEA estimates hold constant the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of 2019 when estimating quarterly changes in income, consumption, saving and wealth throughout 2020. It is therefore assumed that all households remained in the same distributional category in which they were in the 2019 DHEA (e.g., age group, equivalized disposable income quintile, household composition). When the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of 2019 are held constant, it is possible to estimate changes in various household economic indicators without intersecting with changes attributable to households moving across distributional groups. This approach allows for a clearer identification of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on household distributions, as well as the associated impacts of economic restrictions and government support measures on household economic well-being. The DHEA estimates released today are benchmarked to the quarterly income and expenditure accounts and the national balance sheet accounts published in March 2021. All values are expressed in quarterly nominal unadjusted rates, unless otherwise specified.

March data from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are now available. The SEPH provides an account of payroll employment—that is, the number of employees receiving pay or benefits during a given month—as well as earnings and hours worked. In conjunction with results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which provides an account of the number of people working during a specific week in the month, data from the SEPH and the JVWS contribute to a fuller understanding of labour market conditions in Canada. In March, prior to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, public health measures were partially and gradually eased in several parts of the country. In the Atlantic region, provinces eased restrictions to varying degrees throughout March. In Quebec, measures affecting restaurants and recreation and entertainment facilities were eased in some regions in late February and early March, while Montréal and surrounding regions remained under the highest level of restrictions. In Ontario, stay-at-home orders were lifted for all regions, although personal care services, recreation and fitness facilities, and in-person dining remained closed in some areas, including Toronto. Various measures were also eased in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Services-producing sector drives payroll employment increase in March The number of employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer—measured in the SEPH as payroll employment—increased by 245,800 (+1.5%) in March, the strongest monthly growth since September 2020. The March LFS recorded an increase of 303,000 (+1.6%) in the number of people employed (including self-employed). The increases in both the SEPH and the LFS were driven by the services-producing sector, as easing public health measures allowed many businesses in retail trade and accommodation and food services to reopen. Compared with February 2020, payroll employment in Canada was down by 897,900 (-5.3%) in March 2021. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in March at fastest rate since September 2020 SEPH payroll employment rose in eight provinces, with the largest increases in Ontario (+111,600; +1.8%), Quebec (+59,900; +1.7%) and Alberta (+33,700; +1.8%). Employment fell in Newfoundland and Labrador (-1,200; -0.6%), driven by a decline in accommodation and food services (-1,300; -9.9%), as in-person dining remained closed in St. John's and the Avalon Peninsula. Average weekly earnings down in March as hourly paid employment increases Average weekly earnings were $1,125 in March, down 0.8% from the previous month, as employment gains in March were driven by hourly paid—and largely lower-paid—employees. Compared with February 2020, earnings were 7.6% higher in March 2021. The higher average weekly earnings since the beginning of the pandemic reflect a number of factors, including the composition of the overall labour market in terms of the distribution of hourly paid and salaried employees and industries of employment. While the employment gap between hourly paid and salaried employees narrowed in March, the number of hourly paid employees was 6.1% below its pre-COVID-19 level, while the number of salaried employees was 4.1% below its pre-COVID-19 level. Likewise, the sectors that remained furthest from their pre-COVID-19 employment levels—arts, entertainment and recreation (-36.5%), and accommodation and food services (-29.3%)—are among those with the lowest average weekly earnings. Average hours worked decrease for hourly paid employees Average hours worked per week for hourly paid employees were 31.6 in March, 1.3% lower than in February. Average hours worked per week for salaried employees were little changed, at 37.1. Payroll employment increases in services-producing sectors as public health measures eased Payroll employment increased in most services-producing sectors in March (+220,800; +1.7%), led by retail trade (+77,200; +4.1%), and accommodation and food services (+39,900; +4.4%), as public health measures were eased in many jurisdictions. Despite the increase in March, payroll employment in retail trade was 2.9% below its pre-COVID-19 level, while employment in accommodation and food services was 29.3% below its pre-COVID-19 level. The largest growth in payroll employment in retail trade was in clothing and clothing accessories stores (+27,200; +17.4%), followed by sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores (+11,500; +17.4%). As reported in the retail trade release, retail sales rose 3.6% in March. Average weekly earnings in retail trade were $633 in March, up 1.1% compared with February 2020. Payroll employment in full-service restaurants and limited-service eating places, the largest industry within accommodation and food services, rose by 34,900 (+4.8%) in March as restrictions affecting this industry continued to be eased. Average weekly earnings in accommodation and food services were $448 in March, up 4.4% compared with February 2020. Upward trend continues for payroll employment in health care and social assistance Payroll employment in health care and social assistance continued to increase in March, up 22,100 (+1.1%), bringing employment to 1.8% above its pre-COVID-19 level. The increase was led by ambulatory health care services (+10,800; +1.8%), which include out-patient care centres and home health care services. Payroll employment in this subsector has been on an upward trend since May 2020, and, in March 2021, it was 7.6% above its pre-COVID-19 level. Chart 2 Payroll employment continues to increase in health care and social assistance, led by ambulatory health care services Average weekly earnings in health care and social assistance were $1,010 in March, up 5.8% compared with February 2020. Payroll employment gains in the goods-producing sector driven by construction and manufacturing While most of the growth in payroll employment in March was in the services-producing sector, there was also a notable increase in the goods-producing sector (+20,900; +0.7%), driven by construction (+11,100; +1.1%) and manufacturing (+7,700; +0.5%). The March payroll employment increase in construction was shared between all three subsectors (specialty trade contractors, heavy and civil engineering construction, and construction of buildings). The month-over-month gain brought payroll employment in construction to 0.7% below its pre-COVID-19 level observed in February 2020, the highest it has been since the onset of the pandemic. There were notable month-over-month payroll employment gains in 10 of the 21 subsectors in manufacturing, with the largest increase in food manufacturing. As of March, the number of payroll employees in the sector was 4.0% below its February 2020 level, closer to its pre-COVID-19 level than at any point since the onset of the pandemic. One-sixth of all job vacancies in Canada in March are in the health care and social assistance sector In March, Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 632,700 positions (not seasonally adjusted), corresponding to a job vacancy rate of 4.1% (vacant positions as a proportion of all positions, vacant and occupied). This followed rates between 3.0% and 3.9% from October 2020 to February 2021. Quebec (5.1%) and British Columbia (4.9%) continued to have the highest job vacancy rates among the provinces (not seasonally adjusted). In March, health care and social assistance had more job vacancies (104,200, not seasonally adjusted) than any other sector, for a fifth consecutive month. One-sixth of all job vacancies in Canada in the month were in this sector. Retail trade (75,300) and accommodation and food services (68,400) had the second- and third-highest numbers of job vacancies among the sectors (not seasonally adjusted). The job vacancy rate in accommodation and food services was 7.4% in March, higher than in all other sectors in the month, and the highest job vacancy rate for this sector since monthly job vacancy estimates became available in October 2020. The vacancy rate in accommodation and food services reflected increased recruitment in the sector prior to the onset of the third wave of COVID-19 at the end of the month. Looking ahead: Impact of COVID-19 third wave After nearly two months of loosened restrictions in several parts of the country, signs of an imminent third wave of COVID-19 started to appear before the end of March, leading to tighter public health measures across Canada throughout the month of April. April SEPH data—to be released on June 24—will provide detailed information on sectors and subsectors that may have been impacted by the tightening of COVID-19 public health measures that month. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. Payroll employment, as measured by the SEPH, refers to the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and the LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and the SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, new preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are released on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. The JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows for the production of both quarterly and monthly estimates. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupation for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions, offered hourly wages and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment, using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time data tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on June 14. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours, and job vacancies for April will be released on June 24.

Total investment in building construction increased 6.3% to $19.9 billion. Residential construction investment performed strongly in April, rising for a 12th consecutive month. In contrast, non-residential construction has not fully returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. However, it increased by 0.9% this month. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction was up 5.8% to $15.3 billion in April. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Residential investment continues to grow Residential construction reported an 8.1% gain, bringing total investment to $15.3 billion in April. Investment for single-family homes was up 8.9%, as all provinces except Nova Scotia posted increases. Ontario accounted for the majority of the growth (+12.8%), driven by renovation projects in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto and new construction in the CMA of Hamilton. Prince Edward Island reached a record high in this component, surging 84.0% to $101 million, mainly attributable to renovation projects in the province. Multi-unit construction rose 7.2% to $6.7 billion in April. Quebec posted the largest increase, with high-value projects such as an apartment building in the city of Lévis contributing to its 12.0% jump to $1.8 billion. British Columbia also reported notable growth, up 8.2% to $1.3 billion. Infographic 1 Investment in residential building construction, April 2021 Non-residential investment increases slightly Non-residential construction investment advanced 0.9% to $4.6 billion in April, continuing to post small gains for the fifth consecutive month. Investment in institutional construction was up 1.4% to $1.2 billion. The largest increase was reported in Ontario (+2.7%), based on high-value construction projects such as the Michael Garron hospital in Toronto. Industrial construction investment was up 1.8% to $847 million, with the help of major ongoing construction projects in the cities of Toronto and Montréal. Five provinces posted increases in commercial investment, edging up 0.3% in April. Only Ontario and Prince Edward Island have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, with Prince Edward Island reaching a record high. Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in non-residential building construction, April 2021 Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted with current dollar values unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates in constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (Table 18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to the structure type ""single."" Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage.

Exports of goods $50.2 billion April 2021 -1.0% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. Goods trade balance $594 million April 2021 Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. In April, Canada's merchandise imports fell 4.7%, while exports decreased 1.0%. Both declines were attributable in large part to significant decreases in trade of motor vehicles and parts. This was mainly the result of production shutdowns in the auto assembly industry in April because of the shortage of semiconductor chips. Canada's merchandise trade balance went from a deficit of $1.3 billion in March to a surplus of $594 million in April. The surplus in April was the third in 2021, but its value represented less than 0.6% of total monthly merchandise trade. Chart 1 Merchandise exports and imports Explore the most recent results of Canada's international trade in an interactive format with the newly updated version of the ""International trade monthly interactive dashboard."" Starting this month, a section on trade in services is included in the dashboard. Motor vehicles and parts drive the decrease in imports Following a 6.1% increase in March, total imports were down 4.7% in April to $49.6 billion. This represented the strongest percentage decrease since the historic declines of April 2020. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, imports fell 1.3%. In real (or volume) terms, total imports declined 6.8% in April. Chart 2 Contribution to the monthly change in imports, by product, April 2021 Imports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 22.1% in April to $6.6 billion. Excluding the lows of the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, this represents the lowest level since February 2012. Imports of passenger cars and light trucks (-29.7%) and engines and parts (-20.2%) both decreased significantly as many auto and parts manufacturers in North America and abroad stopped or slowed production because of the semiconductor chip shortage. Chart 3 Exports and imports of passenger cars and light trucks, and motor vehicle engines and parts Semiconductor chips are generally not imported into Canada in large quantities as discrete products. Impacts of the global chip shortage will be more apparent in a variety of other manufactured product categories within the North American Product Classification System, where semiconductor chips are already integrated as important components within intermediate or finished goods. Exports of seafood products partially offset the decline in exports of motor vehicles and parts Total exports were down 1.0% in April to $50.2 billion, with 6 of 11 product sections posting declines. Excluding the motor vehicles and parts category, exports rose 1.6% in April. In real (or volume) terms, total exports fell 3.5%. Chart 4 Contribution to the monthly change in exports, by product, April 2021 Exports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 18.1% to $5.5 billion in April. Outside the lows of 2020, this was the lowest level since January 2014. The ongoing semiconductor chip shortage forced Canadian automakers to reduce or stop production in April, resulting in sharp decreases in exports of passenger cars and light trucks (-21.3%), as well as engines and parts (-15.7%). So far, production disruptions in the Canadian industry because of the shortage have been most significant in April. Production in May is expected to be slightly less severely impacted, although more than production in February and March. The semiconductor chip shortage remains fluid, with ongoing adjustments being made to automotive manufacturing operations worldwide. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher exports of consumer goods (+14.4%). The rise was mainly the result of a surge in exports of prepared and packaged seafood products, which more than tripled in April. To reduce the risk for the endangered North American right whales, the snow crab season opened almost one month earlier this year, leading to a significant increase in exports of crab in April. Surplus with the United States rises Imports from the United States were down 5.2% in April, mainly because of the fall in imports of motor vehicles and parts. Exports to the United States increased 1.4%, supported by higher exports of seafood products and softwood lumber. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States widened from $4.2 billion in March to $6.4 billion in April. Chart 5 International merchandise trade balance When the average exchange rates of March and April are compared, the Canadian dollar gained 0.5 US cents relative to the American dollar, reaching the 80-cent mark for the first time since January 2018. The Canadian dollar has increased 12.5% since April 2020. Following a 12.8% increase in March, exports to countries other than the United States fell 7.2% in April, mainly on lower exports to Hong Kong (gold) and the United Kingdom (gold). Imports from countries other than the United States were down 3.8% in April. Following a 27.8% increase in March, imports from China fell 18.8% in April, with widespread decreases across a number of product categories. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States widened from $5.5 billion in March to $5.8 billion in April. Chart 6 Canada's imports and exports with the United States and countries other than the United States Revisions to March merchandise export and import data Imports in March, originally reported as $51.8 billion in the previous release, were revised to $52.0 billion in the release for the current reference month. Exports in March, originally reported as $50.6 billion in the previous release, were revised to $50.7 billion in the current month's release. Trade in medical and protective goods and vaccines Following a steep 23.8% increase in March, imports of medical and protective goods fell 21.2% to $2.6 billion in April on a customs basis. Imports of diagnostic products fell 34.3% after reaching a record high in March. Imports of medical equipment and products (-18.6%), personal protective equipment (-10.8%), and disinfectant and sterilization products (-14.3%) also decreased. Year over year, imports were 4.2% lower than in April 2020, which was the first full month after measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Canada were implemented. Meanwhile, exports of medical and protective goods decreased 5.6% to $1.4 billion in April, following two consecutive monthly increases. Year over year, exports were 7.7% lower than in April 2020. Imports of ""vaccines for human medicine other than for influenza,"" the category that includes the COVID-19 vaccines, increased 57.4% in April to $297 million. Imports in April were more than six times higher year over year. COVID-19 vaccines were first approved for use in Canada in December 2020, and, since January 2021, import values in this category have grown substantially each month, with further increases expected in the months ahead. Chart 7 Imports of vaccines for human medicine other than for influenza Monthly trade in services In April, monthly service exports were down 2.2% to $9.3 billion. Service imports increased 2.2% to $9.5 billion. When international trade in goods and international trade in services were combined, exports fell 1.2% to $59.5 billion in April, while imports decreased 3.6% to $59.1 billion. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the world for goods and services combined was $368 million in April. Upcoming release of the new Canadian international merchandise trade web application In fall 2021, Statistics Canada will launch the Canadian international merchandise trade (CIMT) web application, which will replace the existing CIMT online database. This modernized tool will provide users with a number of enhancements, including access to the full 8-digit (exports) and 10-digit (imports) Harmonized System product categories, as well as insights on CIMT in a more user-friendly, efficient and visually appealing manner. Watch this video to learn more about the added data and features. Table 1 Merchandise trade: Canada's 10 principal trading partners – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 2 Merchandise trade: North American Product Classification System – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 3 Canada's international trade in goods and services – Balance of payment basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Note to readers Merchandise trade is one component of Canada's international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes trade in services, investment income, current transfers, and capital and financial flows. International trade data by commodity are available on both a BOP and a customs basis. International trade data by country are available on a customs basis for all countries and on a BOP basis for Canada's 27 principal trading partners (PTPs). The list of PTPs is based on their annual share of total merchandise trade—imports and exports—with Canada in 2012. BOP data are derived from customs data by adjusting for factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions of the Canadian System of National Accounts. For a conceptual analysis of BOP-based data versus customs-based data, see ""Balance of Payments trade in goods at Statistics Canada: Expanding geographic detail to 27 principal trading partners."" For more information on these and other macroeconomic concepts, see the Methodological Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-607-X) and the User Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-606-G). The data in this release are on a BOP basis and are seasonally adjusted. Unless otherwise stated, values are expressed in nominal terms, or current dollars. References to prices are based on aggregate Paasche (current-weighted) price indexes (2012=100). Movements within aggregate Paasche prices can be influenced by changes in the share of values traded for specific goods, with sudden shifts in trading patterns—as observed currently with the COVID-19 pandemic—sometimes resulting in large movements in Paasche price indexes. Volumes, or constant dollars, are calculated using the Laspeyres formula (2012=100), unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Revisions In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current-year revisions are reflected in both the customs-based and the BOP-based data. The previous year's customs-based data are revised with the release of data for the January and February reference months, and thereafter on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs-based data are revised annually, and revisions are released in February with the December reference month. The previous year's BOP-based data are revised with the release of data for the January, February, March and April reference months. To remain consistent with the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts, revisions to BOP-based data for previous years are released annually in December with the October reference month. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of import and export documentation, incorrect information on customs forms, the replacement of estimates produced for the energy section with actual figures, changes in merchandise classification based on more current information, and changes to seasonal adjustment factors. For information on data revisions for exports of energy products, see Methodology for Exports of Energy Products within the International Merchandise Trade Program. Revised data are available in the appropriate tables. Real-time data table The real-time data table 12-10-0120-01 will be updated on June 21. Next release Data on Canadian international merchandise trade for May will be released on July 2.

Following the April reference week, tighter public health restrictions continued or were introduced in several provinces. In Ontario, a stay-at-home order implemented on April 8 continued, affecting many non-essential businesses. Remote schooling, which began following the April spring break, also continued across the province. In early May, both Alberta and Manitoba introduced measures that included the closure of personal care services, recreational facilities and in-person dining, as well as limits on retail store capacity and a transition to remote schooling for all or large parts of each province. Nova Scotia entered a province-wide shutdown on April 28, closing non-essential retail stores and moving all schools to remote learning. Provincial border restrictions were tightened on May 10. In contrast, New Brunswick and Quebec eased restrictions in some regions through late April and early May. Highlights Employment falls for a second month under third-wave restrictions Employment fell by 68,000 (-0.4%) in May. Almost all of the decline was in part-time work (-54,000; -1.6%). The number of self-employed workers was virtually unchanged in May, but remained 5.0% (-144,000) below its pre-pandemic level. Among people working part time in May, almost one-quarter (22.7%) wanted a full-time job, up from 18.5% in February 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). The number of Canadians working from home held steady at 5.1 million. After falling in April, total hours worked were little changed in May. Ontario and Nova Scotia accounted for most of the overall employment decline in May. Employment increased in Saskatchewan, while there was little change in all other provinces. Unemployment little changed The unemployment rate was little changed at 8.2% in May, as the number of people who searched for a job or who were on temporary layoff held steady. The unemployment rate among visible minority Canadians aged 15 to 69 rose 1.5 percentage points to 11.4% in May (not seasonally adjusted). Long-term unemployment—the number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more—held relatively steady at 478,000 in May. Students start off the summer ahead of 2020 but behind 2019 In May 2021, the unemployment rate among returning students was 23.1%, compared with 40.0% in May 2020 and 13.7% in May 2019. Driven in part by labour market conditions faced by students, total employment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 27,000 (-1.2%). Employment held steady among both women and men aged 25 to 54. The participation rate for women aged 25 to 54 dropped for the second consecutive month, falling 0.5 percentage points to 83.1%. Among people aged 55 and older, employment was little changed for men, while it fell 18,000 (-1.0%) among women. Employment declines hit goods-producing sector In May, total employment in the goods-producing sector decreased for the first time since April 2020. The number of people working in manufacturing fell by 36,000 (-2.0%), the first decline in the industry since April 2020. Employment also fell in retail trade (-29,000) and ""other services"" (-24,000), two industries that continue to be affected by ongoing public health restrictions. There were employment gains in transportation and warehousing (+22,000) and natural resources (+8,600). Natural resources is the industry furthest along in its post-COVID recovery, with employment surpassing February 2020 levels by 29,000 (+9.3%). Employment falls for a second month under third-wave restrictions Employment fell by 68,000 (-0.4%) in May, adding to a decline of 207,000 in April. The unemployment rate was little changed at 8.2%. In addition to the employment declines, the number of employed people working less than half their usual hours increased for a second consecutive month, rising by 83,000 (+6.1%). Total hours worked were virtually unchanged in the month, but remained 3.8% below pre-pandemic levels. Employment in the goods-producing sector dropped for the first time since April 2020, with decreases in both the manufacturing and construction industries. Ontario and Nova Scotia were the only provinces to register declines in total employment. Chart 1 Employment falls for second consecutive month Part-time work declines Almost all of the employment decline in May was in part-time work, which fell 54,000 (-1.6%), following a drop of 78,000 (-2.3%) in April. These two consecutive monthly declines brought part-time employment to 7.5% (-268,000) below pre-pandemic February 2020 levels. Declines in May were mainly in British Columbia and Ontario, where public health restrictions were still in place. At the national level, declines were concentrated among women aged 25 to 54 (-36,000; -3.7%) and young men aged 15 to 24 (-20,000; -4.1%). Full-time employment was little changed in May, following a decline of 129,000 (-0.8%) in April. Prior to April, full-time employment had steadily trended upwards, following the low in April 2020. In May 2021, the number of full-time workers was down 1.9% (-303,000) from its pre-pandemic level. Chart 2 Part-time employment furthest from pre-pandemic level Involuntary part-time rate remains elevated, particularly for men The share of part-time workers who would prefer full-time employment—known as the involuntary part-time rate—is an important indicator of overall labour market conditions. For workers, an inability to find full-time work may have a number of consequences, including financial pressures and delays in accumulating employment experience. Among those working part time in May, almost one-quarter (22.7%) wanted a full-time job, up from 18.5% in February 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). The rate of involuntary part-time work was higher—and had increased more since the beginning of the pandemic—among men (26.3%; +6.2 percentage points) than among women (20.5%; +2.8 percentage points). Among men in the core working age group of 25 to 54 who were working part time in May, more than 4 in 10 (41.8%) would have preferred full-time work, up from a record low of 36.8% in 2019. Across industries, the highest rate of involuntary part-time work for core-aged men in May 2021 was in accommodation and food services (50.2%), up 16.7 percentage points from February 2020. Private sector employees in sales and services most affected by restrictions The number of private sector employees declined by 60,000 in May (-0.5%), adding to losses observed in April (-204,000; -1.7%). This followed employment gains totalling 427,000 in February and March 2021—demonstrating the extent to which employment for this group of workers has been affected by the easing and tightening of public health measures introduced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with February 2020, the number of private sector employees was down 564,000 (-4.6%), with the gap driven mostly by declines in the number of people working in the accommodation and food services industry, particularly those working in sales and services occupations (not seasonally adjusted). The number of self-employed workers was virtually unchanged in May, but remained 5.0% (-144,000) below its pre-pandemic level. Despite an increase in March 2021, self-employment has shown relatively little growth following its downward trend from February to August 2020. In the public sector, there was little change in employment in May. Compared with February 2020, the number of employees in the public sector was up 137,000 (+3.5%), with gains spread across public administration, health care and social assistance, as well as educational services. Working from home remains an important adaptation during the third wave The number of Canadians who worked from home and worked at least half of their usual hours was little changed in May at 5.1 million, similar to its level in spring 2020. After declining following the first wave of COVID-19, the number of people working from home has increased in recent months, largely as a result of tighter public health restrictions throughout the winter and spring. Working from home continues to vary across industries, and these differences can impact some groups of workers more than others. For example, Filipino Canadian workers aged 15 to 69 were among the least likely (16.0%) to work from home in May, as many worked in industries, such as manufacturing, and health care and social assistance, where it is less feasible to work from home. On the other hand, larger proportions of Chinese Canadian (45.6%) and South Asian Canadian (36.1%) workers were working from home in May, partly because of their higher representation in professional, scientific, and technical services, and finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing—two industries where a high share of workers have been able to work from home. Total hours worked hold steady After falling in April, total hours worked were little changed in May. Declines in industries affected by public health measures were offset by increases in hours worked in other industries, including educational services, and health care and social assistance. Hours worked had trended upwards during the first three months of 2021; however, with a decline in April and little change in May, hours worked were down 3.8% compared with the pre-pandemic levels recorded in February 2020. Hours worked among the self-employed were little changed in May and were 13.2% lower than in February 2020. After returning to pre-pandemic levels in March, hours worked among employees fell back in April and were little changed in May at 2.1% below February 2020 levels. Unemployment little changed, with fewer people in the labour market The unemployment rate was little changed at 8.2% in May, as the number of people who searched for a job or who were on temporary layoff held steady. The unemployment rate remained lower than the recent peak of 9.4% seen in January 2021 and considerably lower than its peak of 13.7% in May 2020. Chart 3 Unemployment rate holds steady The unemployment rate among Canadians aged 15 to 69 who belong in population groups designated as visible minorities rose 1.5 percentage points to 11.4% in May (not seasonally adjusted). Increases were recorded among Filipino (+3.7 percentage points to 10.0%), Chinese (+2.9 percentage points to 12.3%) and South Asian Canadians (+1.6 percentage points to 10.8%). At the same time, the unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage points to 7.0% among Canadians who were not a member of a visible minority group nor Indigenous (not seasonally adjusted). Labour force participation drops, led by youth and core-aged women The number of people participating in the labour force (that is, they are either employed or unemployed) fell by 56,000 (-0.3%) in May. The overall labour force participation rate dropped 0.3 percentage points in May to 64.6%. The number of youth aged 15 to 24 participating in the labour force fell by 38,000 (-1.3%) in May, partly because there were fewer students in the summer job market than during a typical month of May. Among core-aged women aged 25 to 54, participation declined by 39,000 (-0.6%). Most of the decline was attributable to a decline in the number of core-age women searching for work or on temporary layoff (-26,000; -6.1%). The number of women aged 25 to 54 who wanted work but did not look for work increased by 28,000 (+17.3%), indicating that some women may have stopped searching for employment as a result of unfavourable business conditions, as the third wave of lockdowns continued in Ontario and restrictions were tightened in several other regions. Number of discouraged job searchers remains high If the people who wanted work but did not look for work were included among the unemployed, the adjusted unemployment rate in May would have been 10.7%, little changed from April. There are various reasons why people who want to work do not search for a job in a given month, including illness or other personal circumstances. Some people—referred to as discouraged searchers—want a job but, do not look for one because of business conditions or because they believe no work is available. The number of discouraged searchers typically increases during economic downturns, and then recedes as job searchers regain confidence in the labour market. In May, there were 49,700 discouraged searchers, accounting for 9.3% of those who wanted work but did not look for work (not seasonally adjusted). This was down from the record high of 146,000 in April 2020, but more than twice the average of 22,000 seen in 2019. Increase in labour underutilization rate driven by lost hours The labour underutilization rate—which complements the unemployment rate by capturing a broader range of people who are available and want to work—rose 0.6 percentage points to 17.6% in May. The rise was driven mostly by an increase in the number of people who were employed but who worked less than half their usual hours (+83,000; +6.1%). All components of the underutilization rate remained higher than in February 2020, including those who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours (+617,000; +76.0%); job searchers (+382,000; +36.7%); those on temporary layoff or with arrangements to start a job in the near future (+125,000; +118.5%); and those who wanted a job but who did not look for one (+178,000; +44.8%). Infographic 1 Labour market underutilization ticks up in May Long-term unemployment remains near record highs Long-term unemployment—the number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more—held relatively steady at 478,000 in May. This was up 299,000 (+166.8%) compared with the pre-pandemic level in February 2020. Long-term unemployment has remained at near-record highs since the fall of 2020, reflecting the continued flow into this category of people who lost their jobs in the spring, summer and fall of 2020 and who have since remained unemployed. Students start off the summer ahead of 2020, but behind 2019 To shed light on the situation of young people seeking summer employment, from May to August, labour force information (not seasonally adjusted) is available for ""returning students,"" or youth aged 15 to 24 who attended school full time in March and who intend to return in September. In May 2020, when many groups—including students—were facing unprecedented challenges resulting from the early stages of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, the unemployment rate for returning students stood at 40.0%, compared with 13.7% in May 2019. In May 2021, the equivalent rate was 23.1%, reflecting the ongoing labour market challenges faced by youth. Employment among returning students was 15.6% lower (-177,000) in May 2021 than in May 2019. In addition to declines in three industries where student employment is concentrated and which are among the most impacted by public health restrictions—retail trade, accommodation and food services, and information, culture and recreation—employment was down compared with May 2019 in the business, building and other support services industry (-16,000; -42.1%), which includes seasonal activities such as landscaping. In contrast, the number of returning students working in health care and social assistance was 34,000 (+64.3%) higher than two years earlier. The number of returning students participating in the labour market in May—that is, who were either employed or unemployed—was 114,000 (+10.0%) higher than in May 2020, when the labour market was still reeling from the impact of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown. Nevertheless, student participation was 69,000 (-5.2%) lower than in May 2019. Chart 4 Summer employment for students up in health care and social assistance Student employment rate lower for females and population groups designated as visible minorities The employment rate for returning students was 39.5% in May, down 7.5 percentage points from two years earlier, with female students twice as far from May 2019 levels (down 10.6 percentage points to 41.2%) as their male counterparts (down 4.2 percentage points to 37.6%). In comparison, the employment rate among non-student youth was 74.6%, a drop of 4.5 percentage points from May 2019. The employment rate in May was 13.0 percentage points lower for returning students who belong to a population group designated as a visible minority (31.8%, not seasonally adjusted) than for those who were not a member of a visible minority group (44.8%). Unemployment increases for visible minority youth Driven in part by labour market conditions faced by returning students, total employment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 27,000 (-1.2%) on a seasonally adjusted basis, and this included a decline of 33,000 (-4.3%) among young women aged 20 to 24. Employment among all young women aged 15 to 24 remained further from February 2020 levels (-187,000; -14.5%) than that of young men (-103,000; -7.8%). The unemployment rate was little changed in May for both male (16.1%) and female (15.8%) youth. For population groups designated as visible minorities, the youth unemployment rate rose 5.4 percentage points to 24.8% and the number of unemployed increased by 71,000 (+50.3%) (not seasonally adjusted). In comparison, the unemployment rate among young Canadians who are not members of a visible minority group was virtually unchanged at 14.9% (not seasonally adjusted). Overall, youth labour force participation fell 38,000 (-1.3%) in May, with losses for young women aged 20 to 24 (-34,000; -4.0%) and young men aged 15 to 19 (-22,000; -4.2%). Compared with February 2020 level, the labour force participation rate was down 4.7 percentage points (to 60.6%) for female youth and 1.6 percentage points (to 62.7%) for male youth. Labour force participation falls for core-aged women Employment held steady among both women and men aged 25 to 54 in May. The number of people who were employed, but who worked less than half their usual hours increased by 44,000 (+12.7%) among core-aged men and was little changed among women in the same age group. The number of core-aged women participating in the labour market fell by 39,000 (-0.6%) in May and the participation rate for this group dropped for the second consecutive month, falling 0.5 percentage points to 83.1%. Participation for core-aged women had recovered in fall 2020 to pre-pandemic levels, and held relatively steady until April 2021. The labour force participation rate of core-aged men was virtually unchanged at 91.4% in May and has held relatively steady since its return to pre-pandemic levels in fall 2020. Long-term gap in employment rate persists among core-aged workers in population groups designated as visible minorities In May, the employment rate of core-aged workers in population groups designated as visible minorities (78.2%, not seasonally adjusted) was lower than the rate of their counterparts who were not members of a visible minority group (84.6%). This difference predates COVID-19, and is consistent with results from the 2016 Census of Population. In May 2021, the gap in the employment rate between visible minority and non-visible minority Canadians continued to be wider among women (72.5% versus 81.6%) than men (84.6% versus 87.5%). Unemployment increases among older Canadians, particularly women Among people aged 55 and older, employment in May was little changed for men, while it fell 18,000 (-1.0%) among women. Compared with February 2020, the number of older men who were employed was little changed, but for older women, employment was down 61,000 (-3.3%) as a result of losses in April and May 2021. The share of older women in the labour force—that is, older women who were either employed or unemployed—was unchanged in May for the third consecutive month, remaining 0.5 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels at 32.0%. Among older men, the labour force participation rate has essentially returned to February 2020 levels, at 43.6%. The unemployment rate for women aged 55 and older increased 1.0 percentage points to 8.9% in May, with most of the increase in unemployment attributable to temporary layoffs. The rate for men in the same age group edged up 0.4 percentage points to 7.4%, following an increase in the number of job searchers. Compared with February 2020, the unemployment rate for older women has risen nearly twice as much (up 3.9 percentage points) as the rate for older men (up 2.1 percentage points). Employment rate for very recent immigrants still trending up Employment among immigrants who landed in Canada within the previous five years was down 11.2% in May compared with the pre-pandemic level recorded in February 2020 (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Over the same period, the population of these very recent immigrants fell 15.0%, as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, bringing the number of newcomers entering Canada to record lows. Because their population fell more sharply than their employment, the employment rate among very recent immigrants continued its upward trend, reaching 66.8% in May, up 2.8 percentage points compared with February 2020. In comparison, the employment rate in May among immigrants in Canada for more than five years (57.6%) was down 2.1 percentage points compared with February 2020, while the rate among people born in Canada (59.4%) was down 2.0 percentage points over the same period (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Employment rate for Indigenous women remains furthest below the pre-pandemic level LFS information for Indigenous people reflects the experience of those who identify as First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, and who live off-reserve in the provinces. While Indigenous men and women were hit equally hard by the initial labour market impact of the pandemic, the employment rate for Indigenous men rebounded strongly through the summer of 2020 and again from March to May 2021. By May, it was little changed compared with February 2020 at 58.4% (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Despite this recovery, it remained lower than the rate among non-Indigenous men, consistent with historical trends. On the other hand, the employment rate for Indigenous women (51.6%) did not see a rebound in 2020, and remained 3.3 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level in May 2021, despite trending upwards since January 2021. The health care and social assistance industry accounted for the largest share of the increase in employment among Indigenous women since January 2021 (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Among the non-Indigenous population, the employment rate for men (63.4%) was 1.2 percentage points lower in May compared with February 2020; for women, the rate (55.5%) was 2.3 percentage points lower (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Chart 5 Employment rate for Indigenous women furthest below pre-pandemic level Employment declines hit goods-producing industries In May, total employment in the goods-producing sector decreased for the first time since April 2020, with notable declines in manufacturing (-36,000) and construction (-16,000). Employment also fell in retail trade (-29,000) and ""other services"" (-24,000), two industries that continue to be affected by ongoing public health restrictions. While employment was little changed in accommodation and food services in May, the industry continued to account for nearly two-thirds of the total employment gap compared with pre-COVID levels. These monthly declines were partly offset by gains in transportation and warehousing (+22,000) and natural resources (+8,600). Chart 6 Industries providing in-person services continue to account for most of the pre-COVID employment gap Employment in manufacturing falls for the first time since April 2020 The number of people working in manufacturing fell by 36,000 (-2.0%) in May, the first decline in the industry since April 2020. Ontario and Quebec accounted for the majority of the overall decline, which mostly occurred among men (not seasonally adjusted). The manufacturing sector continues to be subject to a number of public health requirements, such as physical distancing and enhanced cleaning. Flash estimates from the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing indicate that manufacturing sales declined 1.1% in April 2021. While employment in the industry previously returned to its pre-COVID level in September 2020, there has been little growth since and employment continues to hover around February 2020 levels. Employment in construction falls with tightening of public health restrictions in Ontario Employment in construction fell by 16,000 (-1.1%) in May, driven by declines in Ontario, where public health restrictions affecting non-essential construction were implemented on April 17. The decrease brought the number of workers in construction down to 3.7% (-55,000) below pre-COVID levels. Employment slides further in retail trade Employment in retail trade fell by 29,000 (-1.4%) in May, following declines of 84,000 in April. This brought the number of workers in retail to 6.2% (-140,000) below pre-pandemic levels, the lowest level since February 2021. Tightening public health restrictions in many jurisdictions have affected the operation of stores that sell non-essential goods. Compared with one year before the pandemic in May 2019, about half of the difference in employment (52.5%, not seasonally adjusted) in retail trade was attributable to occupations that typically require at least a high school diploma. However, managers—occupations that generally require higher levels of experience, knowledge or education—have also been affected, with losses representing nearly one-third of the employment gap (29.0%, not seasonally adjusted) with May 2019. Employment in accommodation and food services remains almost one-third below pre-COVID levels The number of people working in accommodation and food services was little changed in May, as restrictions on in-person dining continued across the country. Employment in the industry was 29.8% (-364,000) below its pre-COVID level, and accounted for nearly two-thirds (63.8%) of the overall employment decline (-571,000) since February 2020. Within this industry, employment losses since May 2019 (one year before the pandemic) have disproportionately affected paid employees rather than the self-employed. While some employment losses were initially recorded among self-employed workers—a group that includes restaurant and hotel owners—employment has returned to a level similar to what it was in May 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). In comparison, the number of paid employees in the industry was nearly one-third lower (-30.6%) than in May 2019. Fewer people working in ""other services"" There were 24,000 (-3.2%) fewer people working in ""other services"" in May, an industry that includes personal care services, such as barber shops and beauty salons, as well as civic and religious organizations. The recovery in the industry has stalled since September 2020, when employment was within 3.2% of its pre-COVID level. With the loss in May, employment was 10.5% (-85,000) lower than in February 2020. First employment gain in transportation and warehousing since December Employment increased by 22,000 (+2.3%) in transportation and warehousing, with most of the rise attributable to Ontario and Saskatchewan. Nationally, a notable increase was observed in the truck transportation subsector. The monthly gain in transportation and warehousing was the first since December 2020, and brought the number of people working in the industry to within 4.0% of its pre-pandemic level. While men account for about three-quarters of employment in transportation and warehousing, the employment difference compared with May 2019 was larger among women (-12.0%) than among men (-4.0%) in May (not seasonally adjusted). Prior to the pandemic, the share of workers in this industry employed in the hard-hit air transportation subsector was higher among women (13.2%) than men (6.9%). Natural resources employment above pre-COVID level In May, employment in natural resources rose by 8,600, almost entirely because of gains in Alberta. Following increases throughout most of the fall and winter, global oil prices have remained near pre-pandemic levels in recent months. Natural resources is the industry furthest along in its post-COVID recovery, with employment surpassing February 2020 levels by 29,000 (+9.3%). The recent gains have also erased most of the losses associated with the long-term downward trend recorded from March 2019 to February 2020. Fewer people working in Ontario and Nova Scotia Stringent public health measures and a stay-at-home order remained in place in Ontario during the LFS reference week, while Nova Scotia had entered a lockdown at the end of April. Combined, these two provinces accounted for most of the overall employment decline in May. Employment increased in Saskatchewan, while there was little change in all other provinces. For further information on key province and industry level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" Following a substantial decline in April (-153,000; -2.1%), employment in Ontario edged down (-32,000; -0.4%) in May as public health restrictions continued. The largest declines were in retail trade and information, culture and recreation, while more people worked in a number of other services-producing industries (including accommodation and food services). Declines were also seen in manufacturing and construction. The employment rate in Ontario was 58.3% in May, down 3.3 percentage points from February 2020, tied with Nova Scotia for the largest gap among provinces. The unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage points in May to 9.3%. Employment was little changed in the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), where a lockdown remained in place. Among returning students aged 15 to 24 in Ontario, the employment rate in May 2021 (35.4%) was down 10.0 percentage points compared with two years earlier. The unemployment rate for this group was 27.8%, up from 15.0% in May 2019, but down from 41.7% in May 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Following a province-wide lockdown in Nova Scotia, implemented in late April, employment declined by 22,000 (-4.8%) in May, the largest decrease since early in the pandemic. Losses in May impacted most major demographic groups, and both full- and part-time work. Employment declines were largely in retail trade, educational services, and accommodation and food services. The unemployment rate rose 1.7 percentage points to 9.8%. Nova Scotia's employment rate was 54.2% in May, down 3.3 percentage points from February 2020, matching Ontario's employment rate gap. For the second consecutive month, Saskatchewan was the lone province to post employment growth in May, with the number of people working in the province rising by 4,100 (+0.7%). Gains were spread across industries, including retail trade, transportation and warehousing, as well as information, culture and recreation, while there were fewer people working in construction. The unemployment rate was 6.3%, little changed from April. Employment held steady for the second consecutive month in Quebec, where restrictions eased in some regions of the province. Losses in accommodation and food services and manufacturing offset gains in a number of other industries. The employment rate was 59.5% in May, down 2.4 percentage points from February 2020. The unemployment rate in the province remained at 6.6% in May. In the Montréal CMA, employment was little changed. Among returning students aged 15 to 24 in Quebec, 47.3% were employed in May, down 5.8 percentage points from May 2019 but up from 35.6% in May 2020. The unemployment rate among returning students was 14.8% in May, compared with 36.4% in May 2020 and 11.0% in May 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 7 Employment losses in May concentrated in Ontario and Nova Scotia Looking ahead During the summer of 2020, as Canada emerged from the first round of public health restrictions, employment rebounded at a record-breaking pace. Following the initial drop of nearly 3 million in March and April, the number of people working grew by 1.2 million over May and June, and by a further 1.0 million by September. Employment stalled through the fall as public health measures were put in place to combat the second wave of infections. As these restrictions began to ease, employment increases in February and March 2021 were also among the largest on record. Since the May reference week, public health restrictions have eased in several jurisdictions. In British Columbia, many indoor and outdoor activities resumed on May 25. Quebec ended the nightly curfew and reopened outdoor dining on May 28, while Ontario's stay-at-home order was lifted on June 2. Vaccination rates have also continued to increase across the country. At the same time, measures to control the latest resurgence in infections remain in place in some areas, such as Nova Scotia and Manitoba. As Canada continues to transition out of the third wave of the pandemic over the coming months, LFS data will help shed light on the ability of the labour market to fully integrate underutilized sources of labour and support inclusive employment growth.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for May are for the week of May 9 to 15. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). Since March 2020, all face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both interviewers and respondents. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. Approximately 41,500 interviews were completed in May. The distribution of LFS interviews in May 2021 compared with April 2021, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes April 2021: 65.2% May 2021: 64.9% Online interviews April 2021: 34.8% May 2021: 35.1% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in May 2021 analysis Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business,' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Information on population groups Beginning in July 2020, the LFS includes a question asking respondents to report the population group(s) to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2021 Census, include: White South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan Chinese Black Filipino Arab Latin American Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan Korean Japanese Other According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, people who identify as a member of a population group (visible minority) are analyzed separately. Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations.

The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was one of these programs. It provided financial support to employees and self-employed Canadians who had lost their job or were working fewer hours as a result of the pandemic. Canadian workers had to satisfy a number of criteria in order to be eligible for CERB. For example, they were required—among other things—to have had annual earnings of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application. Applicants received $2,000 for an initial four week period and could subsequently reapply for additional periods, eventually extending to 28 weeks, for a maximum benefit of $14,000. The program covered the period ranging from March 15 to September 26, 2020. Today, Statistics Canada provides a demographic and labour market profile of those Canadians who received CERB from March to September 2020. A more detailed analysis can be found in the StatCan COVID-19 study ""Workers receiving payments from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit program in 2020."" The focus is on workers who had significant earnings in the year prior to the onset of COVID-19, i.e., who earned at least $5,000 in 2019. Additional analyses of CERB and of other emergency government programs will be profiled in the coming months. Of all workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019, about one-third received CERB payments in 2020 Of all Canadian workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019, 35.2% received CERB payments for the period between March 15 and September 26, 2020. Women (36.3%) were more likely than men (34.2%) to receive CERB, reflecting the fact that they were more affected by the lockdowns than their male counterparts. Labour Force Survey data show that from March to September 2020, the total actual hours worked by women fell 16.3% from the same period a year earlier, compared with a 13.1% decline for men. Workers in industries hardest hit by the economic lockdowns and low-wage workers most likely to receive CERB payments In every province and territory, the percentage of workers receiving CERB payments was relatively high among low-wage workers and in industries that were severely affected by the economic lockdowns implemented in 2020. For example, roughly two-thirds (66.6%) of workers employed in accommodation and food services in 2019 received CERB payments in 2020, the highest rate among all sectors. The corresponding percentage for their counterparts employed in arts, entertainment, and recreation was 62.7%. By contrast, relatively few workers employed in utilities (7.0%) or public administration (11.7%) received CERB payments in 2020. These patterns are consistent with the changes in total actual work hours observed from the March-to-September 2019 period to the March-to-September 2020 period. During that time, the total actual work hours of workers employed in accommodation and food services or in arts, entertainment and recreation fell by 41.2% and 44.8%, respectively. At the other end of the spectrum, the total actual work hours of workers employed in utilities fell by 0.2% during that period, while those of workers employed in public administration fell by 1.7%. In line with the fact that the labour market downturn of 2020 disproportionately affected low-paid employees, workers with relatively low annual earnings were more likely to receive CERB than other workers. Of all workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019 and who were in the bottom 10% of the employment income distribution that year, more than half (55.3%) received CERB payments in 2020. By contrast, about 1 in 10 workers (11.3%) in the top 10% of the 2019 employment income distribution received CERB payments in 2020. Relatively high percentages of CERB recipients among young workers and in provinces hit hardest by the economic lockdowns As the COVID-19 pandemic substantially reduced employment in accommodation and food services and in arts, entertainment and recreation, young workers saw their total actual work hours drop significantly from the March-to-September 2019 period to the March-to-September 2020 period. During that period, the total hours actually worked by men aged 15 to 24 fell by 22.6%, while those worked by women in the same age group dropped by 27.7%. Meanwhile, the total work hours of men and women aged 35 to 44 fell by 10.1% and 13.6%, respectively. The percentages of CERB recipients observed across age groups reflect these employment patterns. Of all men aged 15 to 24, 50.4% received CERB payments in 2020, compared with 53.9% of women aged 15 to 24. By contrast, in the 35 to 44 age group, roughly one-third of men (31.2%) and of women (34.0%) received CERB payments in 2020. Likewise, workers living in regions most affected by the labour market downturn in 2020 were more likely to receive CERB. For example, the percentage of CERB recipients amounted to 37.7% in Quebec, 35.8% in Ontario, 34.8% in Alberta and 34.3% in British Columbia. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan — two provinces where total actual hours worked fell to a lesser extent — the percentage of CERB recipients amounted to 28.8% and 28.6%, respectively. The percentage of CERB recipients was even lower in Yukon (25.9%). In the Atlantic provinces, the percentage of workers receiving CERB varied between 31.5% (in New Brunswick) and 33.7% (in Newfoundland and Labrador). Visible minority workers were more likely to receive CERB Workers who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities were more vulnerable to the economic and health repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic than non-visible minorities for a variety of reasons. Canadians who belong to these population groups played a vital role on the front lines during the pandemic, with Black (12%) or Filipino (11%) workers alone accounting for almost one-quarter of all nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates nationally at the time of the 2016 Census. Two-fifths of all workers in meat processing plants belonged to a group designated as a visible minority in 2016, an industry that experienced repeated COVID-19 outbreaks and shutdowns in 2020. Visible minority workers were also overrepresented in accommodation and food services, one of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. In 2016, 30.1% of workers in this sector were visible minority workers, whereas in all economic sectors, they represented 20.8% of workers. Among workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019, approximately two-fifths of those designated as visible minorities (41.4%) received CERB from March to September 2020, compared with about one-third of those who were not a visible minority (32.0%). West Asian (50.8%), Southeast Asian (48.3%) and Arab (45.4%) workers were the most likely to receive CERB payments from March to September 2020, followed by Korean (43.3%), Black (43.0%) and Latino (41.8%) workers. Canadians who belong to population groups designated as a visible minorities were also more vulnerable than other Canadians to the economic shock of the lockdowns because they had lower median employment income before the pandemic. In 2015, the most recent year for which detailed disaggregated data by population group are available, West Asians ($21,516), Koreans ($22,913), Arabs ($23,253), Blacks ($26,807) and Latinos ($28,638) all had significantly lower median income than non-visible minority Canadians ($35,299) and they were also more likely to live in poverty. Indigenous workers more likely to receive CERB than non-Indigenous workers Previous research has highlighted the disproportionate social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indigenous people, including a greater impact on their ability to meet financial obligations or essential needs and a slower labour market recovery. First Nations (41.5%), Inuit (40.3%) and Métis (36.2%) workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019 were more likely to receive CERB from March to September 2020 than non-Indigenous people (33.9%). The higher percentage of CERB recipients among Indigenous workers reflect, in part, their overrepresentation in jobs that provide relatively low annual earnings. According to the 2016 Census, the median employment income of Inuit ($20,984), First Nations ($23,345) and Métis ($31,423) was less than that of non-Indigenous people ($34,013). The Indigenous population is also significantly younger than the non-Indigenous population which, given the greater percentage of CERB recipients among youth across Canada, also helps to explain the greater proportion of Indigenous workers who received CERB payments in 2020. Note to readers In March 2020, the federal government introduced emergency measures to provide temporary financial support to workers, students and businesses affected by the economic lockdowns triggered by COVID-19. These measures included the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), available to Canadians who had lost their job or were working reduced hours, the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, to assist businesses, including the self-employed, and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, to provide financial support to students. CERB was available to: individuals residing in Canada who were at least 15 years old; who had stopped working or had been working reduced hours because of COVID-19; who did not expect to earn over $1,000 in employment or self-employment income for at least 14 days in a row during a four week period; who had employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application; and who had not quit their job voluntarily. Because information on employment income in the 12 months prior to the date of application is not available and because information on employees who quit their job has yet to be integrated in the data, the focus of the analysis is on workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019. For the same reasons, the proportion of workers receiving the benefit shown in this release equal the percentage of workers who received CERB payments in 2020 among those who earned at least $5,000 in 2019. This percentage should be interpreted as a baseline statistic for workers in a given industry or group. It is not intended to represent workers who could have been eligible for CERB in the case of a job interruption. The CERB data highlighted in this release come from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and contain information on initial payments from both streams of the program, one administered by ESDC and the other by the Canada Revenue Agency on its behalf. Earnings in 2019 were gleaned from employee T4 slips and net self-employment income and eligible dividends reported on T1 Income Tax and Benefit Return forms. Main industry of employment was determined from the industry of activity of the business responsible for the most earnings in 2019. The immigrant status and period of immigration characteristics were obtained from the Longitudinal Immigration Database, which contains data on immigrants who landed in Canada from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2019. Other characteristics, such as Indigenous identity and visible minority status, were integrated from responses to the 2016 Census of Population. Information on CERB payments by Indigenous identity and visible minority status are therefore only available for respondents to the 2016 Census. So, the proportions presented for those groups do not include persons who were not in Canada at the time, nor those living on incompletely or partially enumerated reserves in 2016. In this release, ""Indigenous people"" refers to First Nations people, Métis and Inuit. The term ""First Nations people"" includes those living on and off reserve, and include both Status and non-Status Indians.

The total value of building permits remained at historically high levels in April 2021, edging down 0.5% to $11.1 billion, following the record set in March. The slight pullback was mainly due to declines in the residential sector in British Columbia and Quebec, which outweighed national gains in the non-residential sector. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits were largely unchanged (-0.0%). Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, April 2021 Residential sector remains strong despite decrease in April In the residential sector, the value of building permits fell 6.7% to $7.7 billion in April. Despite the decrease, this was the second highest value on record. British Columbia (-23.7%) and Quebec (-14.9%) accounted for most of this decline. The value of building permits for multi-family dwellings dropped 6.5% to $4.1 billion. Gains in Ontario and Alberta were not enough to offset decreases in British Columbia and Quebec, where several large permits had been issued (in both provinces) during the previous month. Eight provinces reported a decline in the value of permits issued for single-family dwellings, with the national total down 7.0% to $3.6 billion, mainly as a result of fewer new projects in Ontario and Quebec. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Commercial and institutional components boost the non-residential sector Commercial permits surged 28.7% to $1.9 billion in April. A $97 million permit for the Sick Kids patient support centre in the city of Toronto and an $80 million permit for the Centennial Community and Aquatics Centre in the city of New Westminster were among several large permits that were issued in the month. In contrast, the largest commercial permit issued nationwide in March was valued at $43 million and was for a warehouse in the city of Pickering. The value of institutional permits increased 23.1% to $910 million, led by Quebec (+135.7%), which rebounded from a 53.6% drop the previous month. Quebec issued numerous large permits in April, such as for a new hospital in the city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu ($56 million) and for a new seniors' care centre in the city of Belœil ($43 million). The value of industrial permits fell 13.2% in April to $592 million. Ontario (-36.5%) accounted for most of the decrease, as fewer permits for large projects were issued in the province compared with the previous month. Overall, the value of building permits in the non-residential sector climbed 17.4% to $3.4 billion.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates have been made available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month has been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for May will be released on July 2.

April Employment Insurance (EI) statistics reflect labour market conditions as of the week of April 11 to 17. Public health measures were tightened in several provinces in late March and early April. In Ontario, a province-wide stay-at-home order was implemented on April 8, which set capacity limits for many non-essential businesses, while permitting curbside pick-up and home delivery. Ontario schools were closed for spring break during the week of April 12. British Columbia was under ""circuit breaker"" restrictions as of March 30, which included limits on indoor dining and gyms. Stricter public health measures were also reinstated in many parts of Quebec, including the suspension of various business activities, as well as the extension of curfews. Number of regular EI beneficiaries up in April The number of Canadians receiving regular EI benefits rose 9.8% (+144,000) to 1.6 million in April. Results from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicate that employment fell by 207,000 in April, while unemployment rose to 1.6 million, including 1.4 million people who were looking for work and 200,000 who had a connection to a job, because they either were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Chart 1 Regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries up in April The proportion of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying under new rules increases in all provinces In late September, temporary changes were introduced to the EI program, including a reduction in the number of insurable hours required for EI eligibility. In April, the proportion of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying for EI under these new eligibility rules increased in all provinces compared with when the new rules took effect, led by Newfoundland and Labrador (+10.7 percentage points) and Nova Scotia (+5.5 percentage points) (not seasonally adjusted). Newfoundland and Labrador (20.2%) and Quebec (18.2%) had the highest proportions of regular EI beneficiaries qualifying for EI under the new rules, while Alberta (11.4%) had the lowest (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Proportion of regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries qualifying under the new rules up in all provinces (not seasonally adjusted) Increase in the number of regular EI beneficiaries concentrated in Ontario The number of regular EI beneficiaries increased in seven provinces in April, led by Ontario (+101,000; +19.1%) and British Columbia (+20,000; +12.1%). Ontario accounted for 70.5% of the monthly increase in total regular EI beneficiaries, reflecting both the reintroduction of strict public health measures and the spring break closure of schools in the province. According to LFS results, employment in Ontario fell 153,000 (-2.1%) in April. At the same time, Newfoundland and Labrador (-600; -1.0%) posted a decrease in the number of regular EI beneficiaries, while Quebec and Manitoba showed little change. The majority (81.6%) of the increase in the number of regular EI recipients occurred in census metropolitan areas (CMAs) (+117,000; +11.7%). The Toronto CMA accounted for more than one-third (37.4%) of the increase in total regular EI recipients. This is reflected in April LFS results, which indicate that one-quarter of the national decline in employment was observed in the Toronto CMA. In April, CMAs accounted for 69.7% of regular EI recipients, compared with 50.6% in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Industries most impacted by public health measures account for two in five regular EI recipients According to April LFS results, employment remained below pre-COVID-19 levels in industries most impacted by public health measures, including accommodation and food services (-29.8%); information, culture and recreation (-10.5%); other services (-7.5%); and retail trade (-4.9%). The profile of regular EI recipients further illustrates the impact of pandemic response measures on these same industries. In April, almost two in five regular EI recipients (39.4%) last worked in one of these four industries, more than double the proportion (19.4%) in February 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 3 Industries most impacted by public health measures account for two in five regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries (not seasonally adjusted) Women account for total monthly increase in regular EI recipients In April, the number of people receiving regular EI benefits rose by 155,000 (+22.7%) among women and dropped by 11,000 (-1.4%) among men. The increase in female regular EI recipients was concentrated in Ontario (+120,000; +48.0%), reflecting both tightened public health measures and spring break school closures in the province. According to the April LFS, national unemployment among women rose 11.4% (+80,000), more than double the increase of 5.4% (+44,000) among men. In April, the number of regular EI recipients aged 15 to 24 increased by 217,000 (+534.6%) compared with February 2020. Female youth accounted for 52.7% of young beneficiaries in April, compared with 29.9% in February 2020, before the pandemic. April LFS results indicated that employment among female youth remained further from pre-pandemic levels than that among all other demographic groups. Number of long-term regular EI recipients continues to rise April LFS results indicated that the number of long-term unemployed Canadians continued to increase, as some people who lost their jobs in the spring, summer and fall of 2020 remained unemployed. Almost one-third (29.6%) of those who were unemployed in April had been without work for 27 weeks or more, compared with 15.6% in February 2020. The challenges faced by many workers in returning to employment are also reflected in EI data. In April, 41.2% of regular EI recipients had received regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit in at least 10 of the 12 previous months, compared with 1.2% in February 2020, before the pandemic (not seasonally adjusted). Among long-term regular EI recipients, more than half (52.1%) were women and almost 6 in 10 (58.9%) were core-aged (aged 25 to 54 years) (not seasonally adjusted). Next release EI results for May will reflect the impacts on regular EI recipients of both continued and reintroduced public health measures in many regions in the weeks following the April reference week. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward consist of individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit). Concepts and methodology The analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March 2020 to April 2021 have been treated as outliers in the determination of a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The number of regular EI beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from April 11 to 17. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals who qualified for EI only as a result of these program changes. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined through the integration of EI and record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. EI beneficiaries by number of months on EI or Canada Emergency Response Benefit over the previous 12 months This supplementary indicator presents the number of regular EI recipients who received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for a defined number of total months over the previous 12 months. A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – Definitions for more information. Data availability Data tables 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337 remain suspended as of the December 2019 reference period, because of occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is ongoing to identify a solution and continue publication of the tables. Data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008 remain suspended as of the March 2020 reference period, because a source data file contains records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries that could not be identified and excluded through processing. In the data table 14-10-0009, for the March to September reference periods, sub-aggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed because of data quality. Next release Data on EI for May will be released on July 22.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.6% on a year-over-year basis in May, up from a 3.4% gain in April. This was the largest yearly increase since May 2011. Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 2.5% year over year. Although base-year effects continue to impact the 12-month price movement for some specific consumer goods, such as gasoline, furniture and beef products, the increase in year-over-year price growth in May was led by rising prices for shelter and passenger vehicles. Unlike March and April 2021, when most of the year-over-year gains in the CPI were characterized by the large upward base-year effects caused by price declines falling out of the 12-month movement, base-year effects affected the 12-month price movement for only a few key goods and services in May 2021. While prices began to recover in May 2020 from the initial pandemic-related declines, they remained below pre-pandemic levels. In May 2021, these lower prices were the basis for the year-over-year comparison, contributing to the 3.6% year-over-year increase in the CPI. The monthly CPI rose 0.5% in May 2021, the same growth rate as in April. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.4% in May. Chart 1 The 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding gasoline Highlights Prices rose in every major component on a year-over-year basis. Shelter prices rose 4.2% year over year in May, the largest yearly increase since September 2008. Prices for durable goods rose 4.4% year over year, the fastest pace since 1989, against the backdrop of rising consumer confidence and low interest rates. Chart 2 Prices rise in every major component Gasoline prices rise at a slower pace in May Year over year, prices for gasoline rose at a slower pace in May (+43.4%) than in April (+62.5%). Higher prices in May 2020, when gasoline prices began to recover from the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, were used as the basis for the year-over-year comparison, contributing to the slowdown in year-over-year growth. In May 2020, gasoline prices rose 16.9% month over month, recovering from March (-17.8%) and April (-15.2%), when both supply- and demand-related factors contributed to significantly lower prices at the gas pumps. On a monthly basis, gasoline prices were up 3.2% compared with April 2021. Much of this gain was driven by supply disruptions to pipelines in the United States and the maintenance of production cuts by international oil producers. Chart 3 Gasoline prices continue to rise Homeowners' replacement cost index rises at fastest pace since 1987 Year over year, the homeowners' replacement cost index rose 11.3%, the largest yearly increase since 1987. Prices have risen year over year for 16 consecutive months, as prices for new homes continue to be influenced by shifting consumer preferences and higher construction costs. Chart 4 Yearly price changes in mortgage interest cost and homeowners' replacement cost Spotlight on housing prices The housing sector is an integral part of the Canadian economy. Residential real estate accounts for about 1/10 of Canadian gross domestic product. The measurement of shelter costs is one of the more complex components of the CPI. There is no consensus on the optimal approach; instead, a few methods are used internationally, depending on the use of the CPI and the available data. The Canadian CPI uses a variant of the user cost approach, and this means that the CPI does not include the purchase price of a property. This is because a house is considered an asset rather than a consumer good. Instead, the CPI measures all the costs associated with owning and living in a property, such as the homeowners' replacement cost, the mortgage interest cost, property taxes, homeowners' home and mortgage insurance, homeowners' maintenance and repairs, and other owned accommodation expenses, such as commission and legal fees on the sale of real estate. These costs are captured in the owned accommodation price index, which accounts for 16.80% of the 2017 CPI basket. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadians have sought out more living space and outdoor amenities, as they have adapted to spending more time at home. This change in preferences, among other factors, has in part driven the average Canadian home price up, influencing the CPI in a few ways. For instance, prices for owned accommodation (+3.5%) rose higher year over year. Higher prices for new homes contribute to higher costs associated with the upkeep of a property, or the homeowners' replacement cost (+11.3%). Higher home prices also tend to raise other owned accommodation expenses (+9.7%). In contrast, lower interest rates bring borrowing costs down. Many Canadians have renewed or initiated mortgages at historically low interest rates since the onset of the pandemic—measured in the CPI through the mortgage interest cost index (-8.2%), which includes both new and resale home prices. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor developments in the Canadian housing market and their impact on consumer price inflation. For more information and data on home price inflation in Canada, please see the housing and construction price indexes. Consumers pay more for durable goods, led by higher prices for passenger vehicles Prices for passenger vehicles led the increase in prices for durable goods, rising 5.0% year over year in May, the largest yearly gain in the purchase of passenger vehicles index since September 2016. The increase was partly the result of supply chain issues related to a global shortage of semiconductor chips. Furniture prices (+9.8%) posted their fastest growth rate since 1982, with prices for upholstered furniture (+10.3%) contributing the most to the increase. The gain in furniture prices was mainly driven by a base-year effect. In May a year earlier, when retail stores were temporarily closed as in-person shopping was suspended, prices fell because of large discounts. While the furniture price index grew at a faster pace primarily as a result of a base-year effect, higher costs of inputs such as lumber also contributed. Meat prices increase at a slower pace in May Year over year, prices for meat products rose at a slower pace in May (+1.1%) than in April (+2.1%), driven by beef prices. Prices for fresh or frozen beef fell 4.3% on a year-over-year basis, mainly the result of a base-year effect. Higher prices in May 2020, when supply was disrupted by plant closures and capacity reductions related to COVID-19, had a downward impact on the fresh or frozen beef price index in May 2021. In contrast, prices for fresh or frozen chicken rose 5.0% compared with May 2020, partly contributing to the yearly increase in meat prices. Infographic 1 Beef prices fall year over year in May because of base-year effect Regional highlights Year over year, prices rose more in May than in April in seven provinces. Year-over-year price growth was strong in the Atlantic provinces, as prices for fuel oil and rent increased. Chart 5 The Consumer Price Index rises at a faster pace in seven provinces Traveller accommodation prices increase month over month Month over month, traveller accommodation prices rose 6.7% in May, up from a 1.5% increase in April—the largest increase recorded since the onset of the pandemic. While prices for traveller accommodation rose on a monthly basis in most provinces, the largest increase was observed in British Columbia (+13.0%), largely driven by increased tourism within designated regional travel zones. Upcoming CPI basket update: Helping to shape Canada's post-pandemic economic recovery The COVID-19 pandemic has had an undeniable impact on the way Canadians spend their money, and capturing these shifts in purchasing patterns is critical to evidence-based decision making. As Canada continues to chart a path to economic recovery, Statistics Canada is updating its methods to ensure its core statistical programs, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are accurate, timely and of the highest quality. CPI basket update in July 2021 The CPI is based on a fixed basket of goods and services designed according to international standards and methods. Since the introduction of the 2009 basket, the agency has updated the basket of goods and services every two years using Canadian household expenditure data. As a result of the unexpected and profound changes in consumption habits because of the pandemic, the basket weight update, planned for February 2021, was delayed. This delay has allowed the impact of COVID-19 on consumer spending behaviours to be better understood, and enabled more recent national household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) data (reference year 2020), the main source for the basket weights, to be obtained. At the same time, the development of the adjusted price index provided a complementary measure of consumer price inflation based on a more timely set of weights from alternative sources of expenditure data, such as those from the Bank of Canada. On July 21, 2021, the new basket weights for the goods and services used in the calculation of the CPI will be made available in table 18-10-0007-01. The new basket weight reference period will be 2020, based on national HFCE data, in addition to data from the Survey of Household Spending and provincial HFCE series. Alternative data for 2020 will be used to account for pandemic-related shifts at more detailed levels of geography and CPI components. More information on the methods and data sources used in the CPI basket update will also be made available on July 21, 2021. One week later, on July 28, 2021, the June 2021 CPI will be released, based on the updated basket weights and CPI classification. For general information on basket updates, consult The Canadian Consumer Price Index Reference Paper, chapter 8, ""Weights and basket updates."" Why are the CPI basket weights being updated now? The current basket weights reflect 2017 spending patterns. Although 2020 expenditures represent an unusual period, the shifts in spending because of the pandemic may lead to more permanent changes as more people continue to work from home, shop online and spend more for shelter. In addition, post-pandemic consumer spending patterns will take some time to stabilize, as reopening and recovery are likely to be gradual and staggered, depending on the region. When will the CPI basket weights be updated again? As the pandemic subsides, Statistics Canada will continue to monitor consumer expenditure patterns during the reopening and recovery period. Another weight adjustment is planned for 2022, to account for post-pandemic spending and to ensure an even greater degree of relevance. Going forward, Statistics Canada will move towards annual weight updates based on the most recent household expenditure data available. Improvements to the adjusted price index are also underway, with the next publication planned towards the end of 2021.

This publication explores the sources of pandemic-related price change and the ongoing impact of base-year effects on the headline CPI. Goods and services in the CPI that were not available to consumers in May because of COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, which effectively removed their impact on the monthly CPI. The values for the following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the all-items index: travel tours, some components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, personal care services in some areas, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. The price indexes for beer served in licensed establishments, wine served in licensed establishments and liquor served in licensed establishments were imputed in several regions, using the indexes to which consumers likely redirected their expenditures: beer purchased from stores, wine purchased from stores and liquor purchased from stores. Consistent with previous months affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for suspended flights were excluded from the May CPI calculation because passengers were ultimately unable to consume them. As a result, select sub-components of the air transportation index were imputed from the parent index (air transportation). The details of these treatments from April 2020 to March 2021 are provided in technical supplements available through the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M). Details and treatments for May 2021 are available upon request. Explore the Consumer Price Index Check out the ""Personal Inflation Calculator""!

To mark Pride Season, we are painting a demographic and social profile of Canada's diverse LGBTQ2+ communities based on published analyses. Much of the data in this release focus on LGB Canadians (lesbian, gay, bisexual), since Statistics Canada has been collecting detailed information on these communities since 2003. Canada's LGBTQ2+ communities are one million strong Canada is home to approximately one million people who are LGBTQ2+, accounting for 4% of the total population aged 15 and older in 2018. Although much has been accomplished since the beginning of the new millennium, including the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2005, and protecting gender expression and identity in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code in 2017, concerns remain, given the spike in hate crimes targeting LGBTQ2+ Canadians in 2019. Almost one-third of LGBTQ2+ Canadians are under 25 years old Combined data from the 2015 to 2018 cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) found that one-quarter of Canada's LGB population were gay men (255,100), while 1 in 7 are gay or lesbian women (150,600). Bisexual women (332,000) outnumbered bisexual men (161,200) by a margin of 2 to 1. According to the 2018 Survey on Safety in Public and Private Spaces, approximately 75,000 Canadians were trans or non-binary, representing 0.24% of the Canadian population aged 15 and older. Youth aged 15 to 24 comprised just under a third (30%) of the LGBTQ2+ population in 2018, compared with 14% of the non-LGBTQ2+ population. At the other end of the spectrum, 7% of LGBTQ2+ Canadians were aged 65 or older, compared with 21% of non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians. One-third of all same sex couples were married in 2016 Since 2001, the number of same sex couples in Canada has grown considerably. Over a period of 10 years from 2006 to 2016, it increased by 60.7%. By comparison, the number of opposite sex couples increased by 9.6% from 2006 to 2016. This increase may be reflective, at least in part, of growing awareness and acceptance of sexual diversity in Canada. Overall, there were 72,880 same-sex couples in Canada in 2016, representing 0.9% of all couples at the time of the 2016 Census. One third (33.4%) of all Same-sex couples in Canada in 2016 were married and two-thirds were living common-law. Half of all same-sex couples in Canada were living in Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Ottawa–Gatineau. About 1 in 8 same-sex couples (12.0%) had children living with them in 2016, compared with about half of opposite-sex couples. The 2021 Census of Population includes, for the first time, a question on gender in addition to a question on sex at birth. This two-step approach will allow Statistics Canada to have reliable data on the trans population, including the gender non-binary population, and to help address information gaps about gender diversity in Canada. With the introduction of gender in the 2021 Census, Statistics Canada will be able to identify, for the first time, trans or non-binary-gender couples, which will allow us to provide a more complete picture of the growing diversity of Canadian families. LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be more economically vulnerable during the pandemic While the pandemic has been difficult for all Canadians, LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be more at risk from the economic fallout. In May 2021, the employment level of Canadian youth aged 15 to 24 remains furthest from February 2020 levels for both women (-14.5%) and men (-7.8%). Given the high proportion of young people among the LGBTQ2+ population, it is likely that LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be disproportionately affected by job loss during the pandemic. LGBTQ2+ Canadians may also have fewer resources to fall back on. For example, in 2018, two-fifths of LGBTQ2+ Canadians (41%) had a total personal income of less than $20,000 per year, compared with one-quarter of their non-LGBTQ2+ counterparts (26%). The average personal incomes of LGBTQ2+ income earners were also significantly lower ($39,000) than those of non-LGBTQ2+ people ($54,000) in Canada. The income difference between the LGBTQ2+ and non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians may be attributed, in part, to the LGBTQ2+ population being younger, and a higher share of this population being enrolled in school, CEGEP, college or university (24% compared with 13% among the non-LGBTQ2+ population), reducing their potential earnings while in school. In 2018, one-third (33%) of LGBTQ2+ Canadians found it difficult or very difficult to meet their needs in terms of transportation, housing, food, clothing, participation in some social activities and other necessary expenses, compared with just over one-quarter (27%) of non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians. LGBTQ2+ Canadians were also less likely to be able to handle sudden, unforeseen expenses of $500 than non-LGBTQ2+ Canadians (11% versus 7%). Given that many LGBTQ2+ Canadians had lower incomes, were having difficulties meeting their financial obligations, and would have difficulties handling unexpected expenses prior to the pandemic, they may be particularly vulnerable financially if they lost employment because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, LGBTQ2+ Canadians (27%) were twice as likely as their non-LGBTQ2+ counterparts (13%) to have experienced some type of homelessness or housing insecurity in their lifetime. Previous research has also shown that rejection from the parental household increases the risk of homelessness among LGBTQ2+ youth, suggesting the family home may not be a safety net for LGBTQ2+ youths if they lose access to housing. Approximately one-third of LGBTQ2+ youth aged 15 to 24 (35%) were living outside their parents' homes in 2018 compared with one-quarter of non-LGBTQ2+ youth (24%). Concerns remain in terms of acceptance, mental health and well-being According to the 2018 Survey on Safety in Public and Private Spaces, LGB+ Canadians (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and Canadians whose sexual orientation is not heterosexual) were more likely to report being violently victimized in their lifetime and to have experienced inappropriate behaviours in public and online than non-sexual minority Canadians. For example, police reported 263 hate crimes targeting sexual orientation in 2019, up 41% from a year earlier and the highest number of hate crimes targeting sexual orientation since 2009. Nearly 9 in 10 (88%) of these crimes specifically targeted the gay and lesbian community, while the remainder comprised incidents targeting bisexual people (2%), people with other sexual orientations, such as asexual, pansexual or other non-heterosexual orientations (6%), and people whose sexual orientation was unknown (4%). Violent crimes accounted for more than half (53%) of hate crimes targeting sexual orientation. By comparison, just over one-quarter (27%) of hate crimes targeting religion and just over half (52%) of hate crimes targeting race or ethnicity were violent. In 2018, sexual minority Canadians were twice as likely as heterosexual Canadians to report experiencing inappropriate behaviours in public (57% versus 22%), online (37% versus 15%) or at work (44% versus 22%) over the previous 12 months. Overall, sexual-minority Canadians were more likely than heterosexual Canadians to report that they consider their mental health to be poor or fair (32% versus 11%). They were also more likely to have seriously contemplated suicide in their lifetimes (40% versus 15%) and to have been diagnosed with a mood or anxiety disorder (41% versus 16%). Transgender Canadians were also more likely to report their mental health as poor or fair than their cisgender counterparts, and also more likely to have seriously contemplated suicide in their lifetimes. They were also more likely than cisgender Canadians to have been diagnosed with a mood or anxiety disorder. A recent crowdsource survey found that gender-diverse participants (that is, participants who did not report their gender as exclusively female or male) were almost 3 times more likely than male participants to report that they had experienced discrimination during the pandemic. More to come Statistics Canada will be releasing information about LGBTQ2+ communities over the course of the next year. A portrait of the trans and non-binary populations will be presented with the initial release of 2021 Census data on sex at birth and gender. Additional analysis on the trans and non-binary populations will be forthcoming once all census variables are released. In addition, an article on the growing diversity of couples in Canada will be published in the families, households and marital status Census release. Statistics Canada will also be releasing a series of four articles using the CCHS over the course of 2021 and early 2022 to highlight the characteristics of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual population on the following themes: family and household characteristics, linguistic and ethnocultural diversity, education and labour. Note to readers The language related to LGBTQ2+ communities is rapidly evolving and terminology may shift over time, vary by context, and mean different things to different people. LGBTQ2 is the official acronym used by the Government of Canada across its programs and policies. At Statistics Canada, the LGBTQ2+ acronym is used to reflect the broad scope of gender and sexual identities that exist in society. The acronym LGBTQ2+ used in this release includes lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another minority sexual identity such as asexual or pansexual, as well as minority gender identity (trans and non-binary identities like genderqueer, gender fluid, pangender or agender).

In April, Canada's merchandise imports fell 4.7%, while exports decreased 1.0%. Both declines were attributable in large part to significant decreases in trade of motor vehicles and parts. This was mainly the result of production shutdowns in the auto assembly industry in April because of the shortage of semiconductor chips. Canada's merchandise trade balance went from a deficit of $1.3 billion in March to a surplus of $594 million in April. The surplus in April was the third in 2021, but its value represented less than 0.6% of total monthly merchandise trade. Chart 1 Merchandise exports and imports Explore the most recent results of Canada's international trade in an interactive format with the newly updated version of the ""International trade monthly interactive dashboard."" Starting this month, a section on trade in services is included in the dashboard. Motor vehicles and parts drive the decrease in imports Following a 6.1% increase in March, total imports were down 4.7% in April to $49.6 billion. This represented the strongest percentage decrease since the historic declines of April 2020. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, imports fell 1.3%. In real (or volume) terms, total imports declined 6.8% in April. Chart 2 Contribution to the monthly change in imports, by product, April 2021 Imports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 22.1% in April to $6.6 billion. Excluding the lows of the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, this represents the lowest level since February 2012. Imports of passenger cars and light trucks (-29.7%) and engines and parts (-20.2%) both decreased significantly as many auto and parts manufacturers in North America and abroad stopped or slowed production because of the semiconductor chip shortage. Chart 3 Exports and imports of passenger cars and light trucks, and motor vehicle engines and parts Semiconductor chips are generally not imported into Canada in large quantities as discrete products. Impacts of the global chip shortage will be more apparent in a variety of other manufactured product categories within the North American Product Classification System, where semiconductor chips are already integrated as important components within intermediate or finished goods. Exports of seafood products partially offset the decline in exports of motor vehicles and parts Total exports were down 1.0% in April to $50.2 billion, with 6 of 11 product sections posting declines. Excluding the motor vehicles and parts category, exports rose 1.6% in April. In real (or volume) terms, total exports fell 3.5%. Chart 4 Contribution to the monthly change in exports, by product, April 2021 Exports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 18.1% to $5.5 billion in April. Outside the lows of 2020, this was the lowest level since January 2014. The ongoing semiconductor chip shortage forced Canadian automakers to reduce or stop production in April, resulting in sharp decreases in exports of passenger cars and light trucks (-21.3%), as well as engines and parts (-15.7%). So far, production disruptions in the Canadian industry because of the shortage have been most significant in April. Production in May is expected to be slightly less severely impacted, although more than production in February and March. The semiconductor chip shortage remains fluid, with ongoing adjustments being made to automotive manufacturing operations worldwide. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher exports of consumer goods (+14.4%). The rise was mainly the result of a surge in exports of prepared and packaged seafood products, which more than tripled in April. To reduce the risk for the endangered North American right whales, the snow crab season opened almost one month earlier this year, leading to a significant increase in exports of crab in April. Surplus with the United States rises Imports from the United States were down 5.2% in April, mainly because of the fall in imports of motor vehicles and parts. Exports to the United States increased 1.4%, supported by higher exports of seafood products and softwood lumber. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States widened from $4.2 billion in March to $6.4 billion in April. Chart 5 International merchandise trade balance When the average exchange rates of March and April are compared, the Canadian dollar gained 0.5 US cents relative to the American dollar, reaching the 80-cent mark for the first time since January 2018. The Canadian dollar has increased 12.5% since April 2020. Following a 12.8% increase in March, exports to countries other than the United States fell 7.2% in April, mainly on lower exports to Hong Kong (gold) and the United Kingdom (gold). Imports from countries other than the United States were down 3.8% in April. Following a 27.8% increase in March, imports from China fell 18.8% in April, with widespread decreases across a number of product categories. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States widened from $5.5 billion in March to $5.8 billion in April. Chart 6 Canada's imports and exports with the United States and countries other than the United States Revisions to March merchandise export and import data Imports in March, originally reported as $51.8 billion in the previous release, were revised to $52.0 billion in the release for the current reference month. Exports in March, originally reported as $50.6 billion in the previous release, were revised to $50.7 billion in the current month's release. Trade in medical and protective goods and vaccines Following a steep 23.8% increase in March, imports of medical and protective goods fell 21.2% to $2.6 billion in April on a customs basis. Imports of diagnostic products fell 34.3% after reaching a record high in March. Imports of medical equipment and products (-18.6%), personal protective equipment (-10.8%), and disinfectant and sterilization products (-14.3%) also decreased. Year over year, imports were 4.2% lower than in April 2020, which was the first full month after measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Canada were implemented. Meanwhile, exports of medical and protective goods decreased 5.6% to $1.4 billion in April, following two consecutive monthly increases. Year over year, exports were 7.7% lower than in April 2020. Imports of ""vaccines for human medicine other than for influenza,"" the category that includes the COVID-19 vaccines, increased 57.4% in April to $297 million. Imports in April were more than six times higher year over year. COVID-19 vaccines were first approved for use in Canada in December 2020, and, since January 2021, import values in this category have grown substantially each month, with further increases expected in the months ahead. Chart 7 Imports of vaccines for human medicine other than for influenza Monthly trade in services In April, monthly service exports were down 2.2% to $9.3 billion. Service imports increased 2.2% to $9.5 billion. When international trade in goods and international trade in services were combined, exports fell 1.2% to $59.5 billion in April, while imports decreased 3.6% to $59.1 billion. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the world for goods and services combined was $368 million in April. Upcoming release of the new Canadian international merchandise trade web application In fall 2021, Statistics Canada will launch the Canadian international merchandise trade (CIMT) web application, which will replace the existing CIMT online database. This modernized tool will provide users with a number of enhancements, including access to the full 8-digit (exports) and 10-digit (imports) Harmonized System product categories, as well as insights on CIMT in a more user-friendly, efficient and visually appealing manner. Watch this video to learn more about the added data and features. Table 1 Merchandise trade: Canada's 10 principal trading partners – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 2 Merchandise trade: North American Product Classification System – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 3 Canada's international trade in goods and services – Balance of payment basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Note to readers Merchandise trade is one component of Canada's international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes trade in services, investment income, current transfers, and capital and financial flows. International trade data by commodity are available on both a BOP and a customs basis. International trade data by country are available on a customs basis for all countries and on a BOP basis for Canada's 27 principal trading partners (PTPs). The list of PTPs is based on their annual share of total merchandise trade—imports and exports—with Canada in 2012. BOP data are derived from customs data by adjusting for factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions of the Canadian System of National Accounts. For a conceptual analysis of BOP-based data versus customs-based data, see ""Balance of Payments trade in goods at Statistics Canada: Expanding geographic detail to 27 principal trading partners."" For more information on these and other macroeconomic concepts, see the Methodological Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-607-X) and the User Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-606-G). The data in this release are on a BOP basis and are seasonally adjusted. Unless otherwise stated, values are expressed in nominal terms, or current dollars. References to prices are based on aggregate Paasche (current-weighted) price indexes (2012=100). Movements within aggregate Paasche prices can be influenced by changes in the share of values traded for specific goods, with sudden shifts in trading patterns—as observed currently with the COVID-19 pandemic—sometimes resulting in large movements in Paasche price indexes. Volumes, or constant dollars, are calculated using the Laspeyres formula (2012=100), unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Revisions In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current-year revisions are reflected in both the customs-based and the BOP-based data. The previous year's customs-based data are revised with the release of data for the January and February reference months, and thereafter on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs-based data are revised annually, and revisions are released in February with the December reference month. The previous year's BOP-based data are revised with the release of data for the January, February, March and April reference months. To remain consistent with the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts, revisions to BOP-based data for previous years are released annually in December with the October reference month. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of import and export documentation, incorrect information on customs forms, the replacement of estimates produced for the energy section with actual figures, changes in merchandise classification based on more current information, and changes to seasonal adjustment factors. For information on data revisions for exports of energy products, see Methodology for Exports of Energy Products within the International Merchandise Trade Program. Revised data are available in the appropriate tables. Real-time data table The real-time data table 12-10-0120-01 will be updated on June 21. Next release Data on Canadian international merchandise trade for May will be released on July 2.

Total investment in building construction increased 6.3% to $19.9 billion. Residential construction investment performed strongly in April, rising for a 12th consecutive month. In contrast, non-residential construction has not fully returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. However, it increased by 0.9% this month. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), investment in building construction was up 5.8% to $15.3 billion in April. Chart 1 Investment in building construction, seasonally adjusted Residential investment continues to grow Residential construction reported an 8.1% gain, bringing total investment to $15.3 billion in April. Investment for single-family homes was up 8.9%, as all provinces except Nova Scotia posted increases. Ontario accounted for the majority of the growth (+12.8%), driven by renovation projects in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto and new construction in the CMA of Hamilton. Prince Edward Island reached a record high in this component, surging 84.0% to $101 million, mainly attributable to renovation projects in the province. Multi-unit construction rose 7.2% to $6.7 billion in April. Quebec posted the largest increase, with high-value projects such as an apartment building in the city of Lévis contributing to its 12.0% jump to $1.8 billion. British Columbia also reported notable growth, up 8.2% to $1.3 billion. Infographic 1 Investment in residential building construction, April 2021 Non-residential investment increases slightly Non-residential construction investment advanced 0.9% to $4.6 billion in April, continuing to post small gains for the fifth consecutive month. Investment in institutional construction was up 1.4% to $1.2 billion. The largest increase was reported in Ontario (+2.7%), based on high-value construction projects such as the Michael Garron hospital in Toronto. Industrial construction investment was up 1.8% to $847 million, with the help of major ongoing construction projects in the cities of Toronto and Montréal. Five provinces posted increases in commercial investment, edging up 0.3% in April. Only Ontario and Prince Edward Island have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, with Prince Edward Island reaching a record high. Chart 2 Investment in residential building construction, seasonally adjusted Infographic 2 Investment in non-residential building construction, April 2021 Note to readers Based on the extraordinary events and business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Statistics Canada continues to make adjustments to the models used to estimate investment in building construction. As a result of these adjustments, there may be larger-than-normal revisions to the data. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Data presented in this release are seasonally adjusted with current dollar values unless otherwise stated. Using seasonally adjusted data allows month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Monthly estimates in constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (Table 18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Detailed data on investment activity by type of building and type of work are now available in the unadjusted current dollar series. Prior to January 2018, building permits for cottages with a value greater than $60,000 were automatically reclassified to the structure type ""single."" Beginning in January 2018, regardless of value, building permits received from municipalities coded as cottages remain classified as a cottage. Effective November 23, 2018, Table 34-10-0175-01 contains data on both the residential and the non-residential sectors. It replaced tables 34-10-0010-01, 34-10-0011-01 and 34-10-0012-01. Next release Data on investment in building construction for May will be released on July 12. Products A study titled ""Price trends and outlook in key Canadian housing markets"" looks at where the housing market was at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, sheds light on what has happened since then and explores the challenges facing the Canadian market going forward. Statistics Canada has a ""Housing Market Indicators"" dashboard. This web application provides access to key housing market indicators for Canada, by province and by census metropolitan area.

Exports of goods $50.2 billion April 2021 -1.0% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. Goods trade balance $594 million April 2021 Source(s): Table 12-10-0011-01. In April, Canada's merchandise imports fell 4.7%, while exports decreased 1.0%. Both declines were attributable in large part to significant decreases in trade of motor vehicles and parts. This was mainly the result of production shutdowns in the auto assembly industry in April because of the shortage of semiconductor chips. Canada's merchandise trade balance went from a deficit of $1.3 billion in March to a surplus of $594 million in April. The surplus in April was the third in 2021, but its value represented less than 0.6% of total monthly merchandise trade. Chart 1 Merchandise exports and imports Explore the most recent results of Canada's international trade in an interactive format with the newly updated version of the ""International trade monthly interactive dashboard."" Starting this month, a section on trade in services is included in the dashboard. Motor vehicles and parts drive the decrease in imports Following a 6.1% increase in March, total imports were down 4.7% in April to $49.6 billion. This represented the strongest percentage decrease since the historic declines of April 2020. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, imports fell 1.3%. In real (or volume) terms, total imports declined 6.8% in April. Chart 2 Contribution to the monthly change in imports, by product, April 2021 Imports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 22.1% in April to $6.6 billion. Excluding the lows of the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, this represents the lowest level since February 2012. Imports of passenger cars and light trucks (-29.7%) and engines and parts (-20.2%) both decreased significantly as many auto and parts manufacturers in North America and abroad stopped or slowed production because of the semiconductor chip shortage. Chart 3 Exports and imports of passenger cars and light trucks, and motor vehicle engines and parts Semiconductor chips are generally not imported into Canada in large quantities as discrete products. Impacts of the global chip shortage will be more apparent in a variety of other manufactured product categories within the North American Product Classification System, where semiconductor chips are already integrated as important components within intermediate or finished goods. Exports of seafood products partially offset the decline in exports of motor vehicles and parts Total exports were down 1.0% in April to $50.2 billion, with 6 of 11 product sections posting declines. Excluding the motor vehicles and parts category, exports rose 1.6% in April. In real (or volume) terms, total exports fell 3.5%. Chart 4 Contribution to the monthly change in exports, by product, April 2021 Exports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 18.1% to $5.5 billion in April. Outside the lows of 2020, this was the lowest level since January 2014. The ongoing semiconductor chip shortage forced Canadian automakers to reduce or stop production in April, resulting in sharp decreases in exports of passenger cars and light trucks (-21.3%), as well as engines and parts (-15.7%). So far, production disruptions in the Canadian industry because of the shortage have been most significant in April. Production in May is expected to be slightly less severely impacted, although more than production in February and March. The semiconductor chip shortage remains fluid, with ongoing adjustments being made to automotive manufacturing operations worldwide. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher exports of consumer goods (+14.4%). The rise was mainly the result of a surge in exports of prepared and packaged seafood products, which more than tripled in April. To reduce the risk for the endangered North American right whales, the snow crab season opened almost one month earlier this year, leading to a significant increase in exports of crab in April. Surplus with the United States rises Imports from the United States were down 5.2% in April, mainly because of the fall in imports of motor vehicles and parts. Exports to the United States increased 1.4%, supported by higher exports of seafood products and softwood lumber. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States widened from $4.2 billion in March to $6.4 billion in April. Chart 5 International merchandise trade balance When the average exchange rates of March and April are compared, the Canadian dollar gained 0.5 US cents relative to the American dollar, reaching the 80-cent mark for the first time since January 2018. The Canadian dollar has increased 12.5% since April 2020. Following a 12.8% increase in March, exports to countries other than the United States fell 7.2% in April, mainly on lower exports to Hong Kong (gold) and the United Kingdom (gold). Imports from countries other than the United States were down 3.8% in April. Following a 27.8% increase in March, imports from China fell 18.8% in April, with widespread decreases across a number of product categories. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States widened from $5.5 billion in March to $5.8 billion in April. Chart 6 Canada's imports and exports with the United States and countries other than the United States Revisions to March merchandise export and import data Imports in March, originally reported as $51.8 billion in the previous release, were revised to $52.0 billion in the release for the current reference month. Exports in March, originally reported as $50.6 billion in the previous release, were revised to $50.7 billion in the current month's release. Trade in medical and protective goods and vaccines Following a steep 23.8% increase in March, imports of medical and protective goods fell 21.2% to $2.6 billion in April on a customs basis. Imports of diagnostic products fell 34.3% after reaching a record high in March. Imports of medical equipment and products (-18.6%), personal protective equipment (-10.8%), and disinfectant and sterilization products (-14.3%) also decreased. Year over year, imports were 4.2% lower than in April 2020, which was the first full month after measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Canada were implemented. Meanwhile, exports of medical and protective goods decreased 5.6% to $1.4 billion in April, following two consecutive monthly increases. Year over year, exports were 7.7% lower than in April 2020. Imports of ""vaccines for human medicine other than for influenza,"" the category that includes the COVID-19 vaccines, increased 57.4% in April to $297 million. Imports in April were more than six times higher year over year. COVID-19 vaccines were first approved for use in Canada in December 2020, and, since January 2021, import values in this category have grown substantially each month, with further increases expected in the months ahead. Chart 7 Imports of vaccines for human medicine other than for influenza Monthly trade in services In April, monthly service exports were down 2.2% to $9.3 billion. Service imports increased 2.2% to $9.5 billion. When international trade in goods and international trade in services were combined, exports fell 1.2% to $59.5 billion in April, while imports decreased 3.6% to $59.1 billion. As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the world for goods and services combined was $368 million in April. Upcoming release of the new Canadian international merchandise trade web application In fall 2021, Statistics Canada will launch the Canadian international merchandise trade (CIMT) web application, which will replace the existing CIMT online database. This modernized tool will provide users with a number of enhancements, including access to the full 8-digit (exports) and 10-digit (imports) Harmonized System product categories, as well as insights on CIMT in a more user-friendly, efficient and visually appealing manner. Watch this video to learn more about the added data and features. Table 1 Merchandise trade: Canada's 10 principal trading partners – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 2 Merchandise trade: North American Product Classification System – Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Table 3 Canada's international trade in goods and services – Balance of payment basis, seasonally adjusted, current dollars Note to readers Merchandise trade is one component of Canada's international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes trade in services, investment income, current transfers, and capital and financial flows. International trade data by commodity are available on both a BOP and a customs basis. International trade data by country are available on a customs basis for all countries and on a BOP basis for Canada's 27 principal trading partners (PTPs). The list of PTPs is based on their annual share of total merchandise trade—imports and exports—with Canada in 2012. BOP data are derived from customs data by adjusting for factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions of the Canadian System of National Accounts. For a conceptual analysis of BOP-based data versus customs-based data, see ""Balance of Payments trade in goods at Statistics Canada: Expanding geographic detail to 27 principal trading partners."" For more information on these and other macroeconomic concepts, see the Methodological Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-607-X) and the User Guide: Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts (Catalogue number13-606-G). The data in this release are on a BOP basis and are seasonally adjusted. Unless otherwise stated, values are expressed in nominal terms, or current dollars. References to prices are based on aggregate Paasche (current-weighted) price indexes (2012=100). Movements within aggregate Paasche prices can be influenced by changes in the share of values traded for specific goods, with sudden shifts in trading patterns—as observed currently with the COVID-19 pandemic—sometimes resulting in large movements in Paasche price indexes. Volumes, or constant dollars, are calculated using the Laspeyres formula (2012=100), unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Revisions In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current-year revisions are reflected in both the customs-based and the BOP-based data. The previous year's customs-based data are revised with the release of data for the January and February reference months, and thereafter on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs-based data are revised annually, and revisions are released in February with the December reference month. The previous year's BOP-based data are revised with the release of data for the January, February, March and April reference months. To remain consistent with the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts, revisions to BOP-based data for previous years are released annually in December with the October reference month. Factors influencing revisions include the late receipt of import and export documentation, incorrect information on customs forms, the replacement of estimates produced for the energy section with actual figures, changes in merchandise classification based on more current information, and changes to seasonal adjustment factors. For information on data revisions for exports of energy products, see Methodology for Exports of Energy Products within the International Merchandise Trade Program. Revised data are available in the appropriate tables. Real-time data table The real-time data table 12-10-0120-01 will be updated on June 21. Next release Data on Canadian international merchandise trade for May will be released on July 2.

This compares with a 3% decline in overall employment. A new study released today, ""Child care workers in Canada,"" presents an overview of the personal and job characteristics of child care workers in Canada and how these characteristics may have changed over time. The study shows that nearly 302,000 people were employed as child care workers in 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast majority of them were women, accounting for 96% of early childhood educators and assistants, as well as home child care providers. It also found that child care workers were younger than the average worker in Canada, were overrepresented among immigrant workers and were more likely to be self-employed. In addition, the study found that they earned, on average, less than half the income of other workers. The study, based on data from the Labour Force Survey and the 2016 Census, also examines how this specific group of workers has been impacted by the pandemic. Immigrants and non-permanent residents are overrepresented among home child care workers Immigrants and non-permanent residents were overrepresented among child care workers, particularly home child care workers. In 2016, 33% of child care workers were immigrants or non-permanent residents, compared with 25% of all other workers. Those working as home child care providers were much more likely than early childhood educators and assistants to be non-permanent residents (11% versus 1%), and somewhat more likely than early childhood educators and assistants to be immigrants (33% versus 27%). In addition, child care workers were more likely than all other workers to belong to a population group designated as a visible minority. Specifically, 39% of home child care providers belonged to such a group, compared with 24% of early childhood educators and assistants and 21% of all other workers. Filipino workers were particularly overrepresented among home child care providers—21% of all workers in this occupation in Canada were Filipinos, compared with 3% for all other occupations. Quebec has the highest proportion of child care workers Based on data from the 2016 Census, Ontario (35%) and Quebec (33%) accounted for the largest share of child care workers, reflecting their larger proportion of the total employed population. When the distributions of early childhood educators and assistants and home child care providers are examined separately by province and territory, early childhood educators and assistants were more likely to work in Quebec; however, Ontario had proportionally more home child care providers. In Quebec, the higher number of early childhood educators and assistants relative to home child care providers can be explained in part by the high number of organized child care establishments (centres de la petite enfance). The ratio of child care workers to the total employed population also varied by province and territory. In 2016, Quebec (2.4%) had the highest proportion of child care workers among all provinces and territories, while Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador had the lowest (1.2% each). These differences can be explained in part by provincial and territorial differences in child care programs. For example, Quebec's partially subsidized child care program offers the lowest cost of child care in Canada and, as a result, a greater proportion of parents use child care services in this province. Other factors, such as the age structure of the population, family composition and the employment characteristics of mothers, at the provincial and territorial level, may also explain these differences. Chart 1 Child care workers as a proportion of the total employed population, by province or territory, 2016 In 2019, one in four child care workers is self-employed Data from the Labour Force Survey show that child care workers were more likely to be self-employed than other workers. In 2019, 25% were self-employed, compared with 15% among all other workers. Child care workers who were paid employees were less likely than other workers to be members of a union or to be covered by a collective agreement (26% vs. 31%), and to have a permanent job (82% vs. 88%). Furthermore, they earned less than other workers overall. In 2015, the average annual employment income of all child care workers ($24,100) was less than half that of other workers ($53,800). This difference was particularly pronounced for home child care providers, whose earnings ($17,300) were notably lower than those of early childhood educators and assistants ($26,800). Despite the recent employment losses in this sector during the pandemic, the number of child care workers is expected to grow, in response to the planned investment in the 2021 federal budget for a new Canada-wide early learning and child care plan. Note to readers Two sources of data are used in this study: the 1991 and 2016 censuses of population and the Labour Force Survey from 1987 to 2019. The data used in the study are restricted to the employed population, aged 15 and older. The 2016 National Occupational Classification (NOC) is used to identify child care workers. Early childhood educators and assistants (NOC code 4214): Early childhood educators plan, organize and implement programs for children aged 0 to 12. Early childhood educator assistants provide care for infants and preschool- to school-age children under the guidance of early childhood educators. Early childhood educators and assistants lead children in activities to stimulate and develop their intellectual, physical and emotional growth and ensure their security and well-being. They are employed in child care or daycare centres, kindergartens, agencies for exceptional children, and other settings where early childhood education services are provided. They can also be self-employed. Supervisors of early childhood educators and assistants are also included in this group. Home child care providers (NOC code 4411): These workers care for children on an ongoing or short-term basis. They care for the well-being and physical and social development of children, assist parents with child care, and may also assist with household duties. They provide care in their own homes or in the home of the child, where they may also reside. They are employed by private households and child-care agencies, or they may be self-employed. ""All other"" occupations: These are all workers other than early childhood educators and assistants and home child care providers.

The decline coincided with the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and was the largest decline in retail sales since April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. The largest declines were observed in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-28.6%) and general merchandise stores (-8.1%). Sales decreased in 9 of 11 subsectors, representing 74.2% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—decreased 7.6%. In volume terms, retail sales decreased 5.6% in April. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. In light of continuing restrictions, both retailers and consumers have adapted to these business conditions. Based on respondent feedback, 5.0% of retailers were closed at some point in April, compared with approximately one-third of retailers being closed at the same time last year. The average length of the shutdown was one day, compared with eight days in April 2020. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 3.2% in May. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 62% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 91%. Chart 1 Retail sales decrease in April Widespread declines in core retail sales amid COVID-19 third wave restrictions Core retail sales fell 7.6% in April, the largest decline in a year and second largest decline on record. The decline was concentrated in those retailers deemed ""non-essential,"" with all store types except food and beverage stores (+0.6%) and miscellaneous store retailers (+0.9%) posting declines. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores fell 28.6% in April. The decline was led by lower sales at clothing stores (-31.3%) and shoe stores (-32.1%). In April, 22.0% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of five days. This represented a widespread re-closing of stores, as 5.1% of clothing and clothing accessories stores reported closures in March. Sales declined by 8.1% at general merchandise stores. This was the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Despite the decline in sales, only 0.6% of general merchandise stores were closed during April. Stores may have been impacted in other ways such as restrictions on the types of products they could sell. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers declined for the first time in nine months (-10.4%). Despite the decline, sales remained above levels reached in February 2021. The decline comes after record sales of hardware, tools, and renovation and lawn and garden products in March. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations fall for the first time in four months Sales fell by 1.4% at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Sales were down in all four subsectors, led by new car dealers (-1.1%) and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (-3.5%). Sales at gasoline stations fell 4.1% in April. Gasoline prices were on the rise in April, in part due to production cuts by OPEC+ countries (countries from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus). In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations declined 3.5%. Chart 2 Sales decrease in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales down in seven provinces In Ontario, sales declined 13.4%, the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Sales declined 8.7% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, whereas sales fell by 16.3% in the rest of the province. The decline in sales was largest at general merchandise stores and clothing and clothing accessories stores. Quebec (-1.8%) posted the second largest provincial decline. In the CMA of Montréal, sales fell 0.3%, and in the rest of Quebec, sales declined 3.1%. Sales remained flat in the Atlantic provinces (-0.0%). Second consecutive increases in New Brunswick (+1.9%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (+1.5%) were offset by lower sales in Nova Scotia (-2.3%) and Prince Edward Island (-0.4%). Retail e-commerce in Canada On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 0.4% in April. On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 7.4% year over year to $4.0 billion in April, accounting for 7.0% of total retail trade. The share of e-sales out of total retail sales rose 0.4 percentage points in April. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes. Real-time tables Real-time tables 20-10-0054-01 and 20-10-0079-01 will be updated soon. Next release Data on retail trade for May will be released on July 23.

It was where we worked and studied, how we stayed in touch with loved ones and increasingly where we shopped. While the share of Canadians (92%) using the Internet increased only slightly since 2018 (91%), how we use it and for how long each day has changed dramatically since the onset of the pandemic. The Internet helped fill the void during the pandemic During a year when brick and mortar stores were not always an option, many Canadians turned to the Internet for their purchases. More than four in five Canadians (82%) shopped online in 2020, up from 73% in 2018. Online spending rose by approximately one-half over this period, from $57.4 billion to $84.4 billion. Just over one in five Canadians (21%) said they shopped online for groceries more frequently than before the pandemic, and 45% shopped more frequently for other physical goods. In fact, 13% of Canadians ordered groceries online for the first time during the pandemic and 9% bought other physical goods for the first time. Working from home was the only option for some Canadians during the pandemic. Over two-fifths of Canadians 18 to 65 years of age (43%) said they used the Internet more often to work from home than before the pandemic and 15% used the Internet to work from home for the first time. Without the ability to connect in person for much of the year, most Canadians used the Internet to communicate with others through instant messaging apps (76%) or social networking websites (71%). Almost two-thirds of Canadians (64%) used the Internet to make online voice or video calls, up from 47% in 2018. With more time at home in 2020, and most in-person entertainment activities unavailable, Canadians turned to online options. Approximately four in five Canadians (83%) watched streamed content online in 2020, and over one-third (38%) watched more than 10 hours in a typical week. Just over one-third of Canadians (35%) reported playing online video games in 2020, and one in ten (10%) reported playing for more than 10 hours in a typical week. As Canadians spent a lot of time online in 2020, more felt the need to take a break from using the Internet or to reduce their time spent on the Internet (24%) compared with 2018 (21%). Three-quarters of Canadians bought goods online in 2020 While Canadians shopped and spent more for goods online, it is not surprising that they spent less on services such as travel arrangements or tickets for live sporting, entertainment or cultural events, most of which were limited or prohibited during the pandemic. Physical goods such as clothing, groceries, books and electronics constituted the most frequent type of goods bought online in both 2018 and 2020. Just over three in four Canadians (76%) bought physical goods in 2020, up from 63% in 2018. Meanwhile, their spending on these goods doubled from an average of $1,165 in 2018 to $2,336 in 2020. Just over one in six Canadians (16%) relied on the Internet for online purchases of physical goods through subscriptions in 2020, with 7% of Canadians receiving meal kit boxes on a regular basis, 5% receiving groceries such as food or beverages and 9% receiving other physical goods. Over two-thirds of Canadians (68%) bought digital goods and services in 2020 such as music or video downloads and online data-storage services, up from 52% in 2018. Shoppers who bought digital goods and services spent on average $568 in 2020, up from $346 in 2018. In 2020, almost one in ten Canadians (9%) used peer-to-peer accommodation services such as Airbnb and Flipkey and half (49%) ordered some type of other online service, such as food or beverages ordered from restaurants, travel arrangements, tickets for entertainment events and peer-to-peer ride services, such as Uber and Lyft. With the onset of the pandemic, some of these services were no longer offered or access to them was restricted in parts of Canada. Although the overall share of Canadians buying ""other online services"" increased, the average amount spent fell from $1,470 to $1,048. Internet shoppers support Canadian businesses during the pandemic In 2020, 38% of Canadians reported purchasing online goods or services from a business specifically because it was Canadian, compared with 29% in 2018. This type of behaviour was most pronounced among those in the 25 to 44 age group, with almost half (49%) reporting that they bought from businesses specifically because they were Canadian. Majority encountered a problem while ordering online Although most Canadians shopped online in 2020, many encountered problems or barriers when doing so. Over two-thirds of Canadians who shopped online (69%) encountered problems while ordering. The most frequent issues included the speed of delivery which was slower than indicated (48%), a foreign retailer did not sell or ship to Canada (30%) or the product ordered was of a lower quality than expected (26%). Of the Canadians who did not shop online in 2020, almost three-quarters (73%) said they had no need to, or were not interested in ordering online, 23% were concerned about security or privacy, 18% wanted the opportunity to see, hold, or try the product before buying it, and 16% said ordering online was too difficult. More than one-quarter of Canadians spent 20 hours or more using the Internet per week Given the limited options for in-person activities during the pandemic, more Canadians turned to online options. In a typical week in 2020, more than one-quarter (27%) spent 20 hours or more on the Internet for personal use, up from 19% in 2018. This excluded time spent watching streamed video content and using video gaming services. Two in five Canadians checked their phone at least every 30 minutes The vast majority of Canadians (84%) relied on a smartphone for personal use in 2020 to communicate, to do research, or for entertainment. When asked about smartphone habits in a typical day, just over half of Canadians (53%) said that checking their smartphone was the first thing they did when they woke up and the last thing they did before going to bed (51%). In a typical day, 43% of Canadians said they checked their smartphone at least every 30 minutes. As for younger Canadians, 71% of those 15 to 24 years of age checked their smartphone at least every 30 minutes, with 17% checking their phone every 5 minutes. Two-thirds of Canadians used the Internet to search for health information Although many Canadians took to the Internet for their entertainment needs, it was also used as a tool to monitor health. In 2020, over two-thirds of Canadians (69%) used the Internet to search for health information and one-quarter (25%) used the Internet to track their fitness or health, for example to count steps or plan meals. In addition, 14% of Canadians used Internet-connected wearable smart devices, such as a smart watch, Fit Bit or glucose monitoring device. Cyber security incidents increase during the pandemic The percentage of Canadians reporting a cyber security incident rose from 52% in 2018 to 58% in 2020. Among the incidents most often reported were: receiving fraudulent emails or unsolicited spam (49%), getting redirected to fraudulent websites asking for personal information (20%), a virus or other computer infection (10%) or a fraudulent payment card use (7%). Although more than half of Canadians encountered an online incident in 2020, few (2%) reported a financial loss that they did not recover. Canadians took some steps online to protect their personal data in 2020, with almost three-quarters (74%) taking at least one of the following actions: restricting or refusing access to their geographical location (59%), denying the use of personal data for advertising purposes (57%), changing the privacy settings on accounts or apps to limit their profile or personal information (49%) and checking that the website where they share personal data is secure (45%). Some gaps remain in Internet use Despite the high level of Internet use among the Canadian population overall in 2020, gaps remained when looking at specific demographics and place of residence. For example, compared with the Canadian average (92%), about 62% of Canadians 75 years of age and older had used the Internet. Other population sub-groups that registered Internet use below the Canadian average were: people with a disability (84%), those not employed (85%), those living outside of a Census Metropolitan Area or Census Agglomeration (87%) and Indigenous people (88%). Almost all Canadians living in a family household with children under 18 years of age (98%) used the Internet in 2020, compared with 80% of single-person households.

Table 1 Internet use by selected characteristics, 2020 Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — the United Nation's transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the next 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Canadian Internet Use Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used to help to measure the following goals: Note to readers The 2020 Canadian Internet Use Survey, sponsored by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, was conducted from November 2020 to March 2021. The target population is all persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada. It excludes full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions. A survey specific to Internet access and use in the Northern Territories will be conducted between July and December 2021. The data will be released in the spring of 2022. The Canadian Internet Use Survey was redesigned in 2018. The findings from 2018 and 2020 should not be compared with those from previous surveys. Census metropolitan areas are cities with a population centre of at least 100,000 and census agglomerations must have a core population of at least 10,000, based on data from the previous census. On June 24, an article on Internet use and COVID-19: How the pandemic increased the amount of time Canadians spend online, will be released in the StatCan series ""COVID-19: Data to Insights for a Better Canada publication"". This article features data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey and Great Britain's Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which is conducted by the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics.

The month of June is also National Indigenous History Month, dedicated this year to the missing children, the families left behind and the survivors of residential schools. To mark the occasion, we are providing a brief profile of First Nations, Métis and Inuit, as well as a look at the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic on Indigenous people. More information can be found on Statistics Canada's Indigenous Statistics Portal, a central location where users can find links to data and information products related to First Nations people, Métis and Inuit, including community profiles. This spring, households across Canada received a Census form, short or long. Like every census since 2006, Indigenous communities were invited to access their questionnaire in 13 Indigenous languages. The statistical stories told through the census will support policy development by Indigenous governments, communities and organizations, and will help better understand the experiences of Indigenous people living in Canada today. Data from the 2021 Census will be released throughout 2022 (see the release calendar). Statistics Canada counted 1,673,785 Indigenous people during the 2016 Census, including 977,230 First Nations people, 587,545 Métis and 65,025 Inuit. Indigenous people accounted for 4.9% of the total population in 2016, up from 3.8% in 2006 and 2.8% in 1996. The Indigenous population is young. The average age of the Indigenous population was 32.1 years in 2016—almost a decade younger than the non-Indigenous population (40.9 years). Over half of First Nations people live in Western Canada Over half of First Nations people were living in British Columbia (17.7%), Alberta (14.0%), Manitoba (13.4%) or Saskatchewan (11.7%) at the time of the 2016 Census. Almost one-quarter (24.2%) lived in Ontario, the largest share among the provinces, while 9.5% lived in Quebec. Over three in five Métis live in urban areas of at least 30,000 people Of the three Indigenous groups, Métis were the most likely to live in a city, with 62.6% living in an urban area of at least 30,000 people in 2016, compared with 51.8% for the Indigenous population overall. There were eight metropolitan areas with a population of more than 10,000 Métis in 2016: Winnipeg, Edmonton, Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa–Gatineau, Montréal, Toronto and Saskatoon. Combined, these areas accounted for just over one-third (34.0%) of the entire Métis population. Close to three-quarters of Inuit live in Inuit Nunangat Inuit Nunangat is the homeland of Inuit in Canada and includes four Inuit regions: Nunatsiavut (Northern coastal Labrador), Nunavik (Northern Quebec), the territory of Nunavut, and the Inuvialuit region (Northwest Territories). Among Inuit in Inuit Nunangat, the majority (63.7%) lived in Nunavut in 2016, while one-quarter (24.9%) lived in Nunavik. Another 6.6% lived in the Inuvialuit region, while 4.8% lived in Nunatsiavut. Over 70 Indigenous languages spoken in Canada Indigenous languages in Canada have been evolving over generations and reflect rich and diverse histories, landscapes, cultures and knowledge. More than 70 Indigenous languages were reported in the 2016 Census and 36 had at least 500 speakers. The most widely spoken were Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway. The number of Indigenous people who could speak an Indigenous language grew by 3.1% from 2006 to 2016. A growing number of people are learning an Indigenous language as a second language. As a result, there were 263,840 people who reported that they could speak an Indigenous language well enough to conduct a conversation in 2016, up 8% from 1996. In 2016, over three-quarters of the residents of Nunavut (76.8%) reported being able to conduct a conversation in Inuktut. Indigenous people are keeping cultural traditions alive Harvesting activities such as hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering wild plants have been part of First Nations, Métis and Inuit way of life for millennia. These practices have endured despite the impact of colonization, and are important for fostering cultural identity, meeting nutritional needs, health as well as the local economy. Just under two-thirds (65%) of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat participated in hunting, fishing or trapping in 2017, as did approximately one in three of First Nations people (33%) living off reserve and Métis (35%). The impacts of the pandemic on Indigenous people The measures put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 have had a greater impact on Indigenous people, in part because they faced greater barriers related to unemployment, food insecurity and financial vulnerability, than on non-Indigenous people. Statistics Canada conducted a series of rapid response crowdsource surveys from April to August 2020 to find out how Canadians were faring during the pandemic. Over one-third (36%) of Indigenous participants reported that the pandemic had a strong or moderate impact on their ability to meet financial obligations or essential needs, compared with one-quarter (25%) of non-Indigenous participants. Overall, 60% of Indigenous participants reported worsening mental health, and almost half (47%) of Indigenous women were ""very"" or ""extremely"" concerned about family stress due to confinement. Indigenous women harder hit by job losses during the pandemic Recent data from the Labour Force Survey provide insights on the labour market impacts of the pandemic on Indigenous people, as of May 2021. While Indigenous men and women were hit equally hard by the initial labour market impact of the pandemic, the employment rate for Indigenous men has rebounded and by May 2021, it was little changed compared with February 2020 at 58.4% (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). However, it remained lower than the rate among non-Indigenous men (63.4%), consistent with historical trends. On the other hand, the employment rate for Indigenous women (51.6%) did not rebound in 2020. In May 2021, it was 3.3 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level, despite trending upwards since January 2021. In comparison, the employment rate for non-Indigenous women was 2.3 percentage points lower compared with its pre-pandemic level, at 55.5% (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). The tragic legacy of residential schools With the recent confirmation surrounding the remains of 215 Indigenous children at the former residential school in Kamloops, resurfaces the shameful legacy of the Indian Residential School system in Canada, and the hurt and harm this system continues to cause for Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc and other First Nations people, Métis and Inuit. The Indian Residential School system operated across Canada from 1867 to 1996, peaking in 1930 when 80 schools were in operation. Children were separated from their families and their communities to attend residential school. Incidents of abuse have been cited by many former students. The system has led to a loss of language and culture among Indigenous people, as a key objective of the residential school system was the assimilation of Indigenous children. According to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, there are records of at least 4,100 children dying in residential schools. There were an estimated 80,000 survivors of the Indian residential school system in 2015. Although the residential school system no longer exists, intergenerational trauma remains, affecting many Indigenous people and their communities to this day. A National Indian Residential School Crisis Line is available to provide support to former residential school students. Emotional and crisis referral services can be accessed by calling the 24-Hour National Crisis Line at 1-866-925-4419.

Following four consecutive months of reaching new highs, the total value of building permits dropped a record $1.6 billion (-14.8%) to $9.5 billion in May. Every component was down, with multi-family dwellings in Ontario accounting for nearly three fifths of the overall national decline. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits decreased 14.5% to $7.1 billion. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, May 2021 Multi-family permits in Ontario pull residential sector down The value of permits for multi-family dwellings dropped 20.6% to $3.3 billion in May, the lowest value since August 2020. Ontario was responsible for the majority of the decline. All provinces except for Newfoundland and Labrador posted a decrease in the value of permits issued for single-family dwellings, which fell 10.6% nationally to $3.2 billion. Quebec accounted for almost half of the national decline, with fewer permits issued in municipalities outside of the census metropolitan areas. Overall, the value of permits issued in the residential sector pulled back 16.0% to $6.5 billion. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Non-residential permits drop due to Ontario and Quebec Construction intentions for the non-residential sector were down 12.2% to $3.0 billion in May, with Ontario and Quebec falling 21.5% and 22.9% respectively. Commercial permits tumbled 15.8% to $1.6 billion overall. Ontario dropped 33.9% as no permit in excess of $25 million was issued for the province in May, compared with six in the previous month, worth a total of $295 million. The value of permits issued for industrial buildings fell 14.6% to $511 million. Seven provinces reported a decline in this component, with Quebec recording the largest decrease. Quebec saw an uptick in April, largely due to a $105 million permit issued for renovations to a mining facility in the municipality of Sept-Îles. The value of institutional permits decreased 3.4% to $900 million. Gains in four provinces, led by British Columbia and Manitoba, were not enough to counter a $115 million decline observed in Quebec.

For more information on housing, please visit the Housing Statistics Portal. Statistics Canada has a Housing Market Indicators dashboard. This Web application provides access to key housing market indicators for Canada, by province and by census metropolitan area. These indicators are updated automatically with new information from monthly releases, giving users access to the latest data. Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates have been made available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for June will be released on August 4.

Definitions New housing price index New Housing Price Index (NHPI)Opens a new window is a monthly series that measures changes over time in the contractors' selling prices of new residential houses, where detailed specifications pertaining to each house remain the same between two consecutive periods. The survey covers the following dwelling types: single homes, semi-detached homes and townhouses. Building permits The monthly Building Permits (BPER)Opens a new window survey collects data on the value of permits issued by Canadian municipalities for both residential and non-residential buildings, and the number of residential dwellings authorized. The survey also measures the number of dwelling units demolished. Building Permit data are widely used as a leading indicator for the construction industry since the issuance of a building permit is one of the first steps in the construction process. Housing starts A housing start is defined as the beginning of construction work on a building, usually when the concrete has been poured for the whole of the footing around the structure, or an equivalent stage where a basement will not be part of the structure. For survey methodology, visit the Housing Market Information PortalOpens a new window from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Housing completions A housing completion is defined as the stage at which all the proposed construction work on a dwelling unit has been performed, although under some circumstances a dwelling may be counted as completed where up to 10 per cent of the proposed work remains to be done. For survey methodology, visit the Housing Market Information PortalOpens a new window from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Shelter price index The Shelter price index tracks price changes related to the costs of owning or renting a home. It is one of the 8 major components in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)Opens a new window and, among them, it is the most heavily weighted component, making up over a quarter of the total CPI basket weight (as of the 2015 Basket). Shelter is composed of various sub-components, such as rent, electricity, mortgage interest cost, homeowner’s replacement cost and homeowner’s home and mortgage insurance. Population 15+ Number of persons of working age, 15 years of age and over. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred. For definitions, data sources and methods, consult the Labour Force Survey (LFS)Opens a new window. Employment Number of persons who, during the reference week, worked for pay or profit, or performed unpaid family work or had a job but were not at work due to own illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, labour dispute, vacation, or other reason. Those persons on layoff and persons without work but who had a job to start at a definite date in the future are not considered employed. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred.

The decline coincided with the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and was the largest decline in retail sales since April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. The largest declines were observed in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-28.6%) and general merchandise stores (-8.1%). Sales decreased in 9 of 11 subsectors, representing 74.2% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—decreased 7.6%. In volume terms, retail sales decreased 5.6% in April. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. In light of continuing restrictions, both retailers and consumers have adapted to these business conditions. Based on respondent feedback, 5.0% of retailers were closed at some point in April, compared with approximately one-third of retailers being closed at the same time last year. The average length of the shutdown was one day, compared with eight days in April 2020. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 3.2% in May. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 62% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 91%. Chart 1 Retail sales decrease in April Widespread declines in core retail sales amid COVID-19 third wave restrictions Core retail sales fell 7.6% in April, the largest decline in a year and second largest decline on record. The decline was concentrated in those retailers deemed ""non-essential,"" with all store types except food and beverage stores (+0.6%) and miscellaneous store retailers (+0.9%) posting declines. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores fell 28.6% in April. The decline was led by lower sales at clothing stores (-31.3%) and shoe stores (-32.1%). In April, 22.0% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of five days. This represented a widespread re-closing of stores, as 5.1% of clothing and clothing accessories stores reported closures in March. Sales declined by 8.1% at general merchandise stores. This was the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Despite the decline in sales, only 0.6% of general merchandise stores were closed during April. Stores may have been impacted in other ways such as restrictions on the types of products they could sell. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers declined for the first time in nine months (-10.4%). Despite the decline, sales remained above levels reached in February 2021. The decline comes after record sales of hardware, tools, and renovation and lawn and garden products in March. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations fall for the first time in four months Sales fell by 1.4% at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Sales were down in all four subsectors, led by new car dealers (-1.1%) and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (-3.5%). Sales at gasoline stations fell 4.1% in April. Gasoline prices were on the rise in April, in part due to production cuts by OPEC+ countries (countries from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus). In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations declined 3.5%. Chart 2 Sales decrease in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales down in seven provinces In Ontario, sales declined 13.4%, the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Sales declined 8.7% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, whereas sales fell by 16.3% in the rest of the province. The decline in sales was largest at general merchandise stores and clothing and clothing accessories stores. Quebec (-1.8%) posted the second largest provincial decline. In the CMA of Montréal, sales fell 0.3%, and in the rest of Quebec, sales declined 3.1%. Sales remained flat in the Atlantic provinces (-0.0%). Second consecutive increases in New Brunswick (+1.9%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (+1.5%) were offset by lower sales in Nova Scotia (-2.3%) and Prince Edward Island (-0.4%). Retail e-commerce in Canada On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 0.4% in April. On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 7.4% year over year to $4.0 billion in April, accounting for 7.0% of total retail trade. The share of e-sales out of total retail sales rose 0.4 percentage points in April. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

This marked the largest increase on record for the sector, due in large part to the sharp declines seen at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Higher sales were reported in 16 of the 19 commodity categories. Looking ahead to April, the advance estimate provided by the Monthly Retail Trade Survey suggests that unadjusted total retail sales increased by 60.1%. Because of its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. Automotive sales accelerate into March Strong sales of motor vehicles in March, coupled with sharp declines at the onset of the pandemic a year earlier, resulted in record growth on a year-over-year basis for the product category (+75.1%). This was the largest gain among all categories in dollar terms. Growth in automotive sales was driven largely by higher sales of new motor vehicles (+85.8%), as new minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks (+89.5%), new passenger automobiles (+70.5%), and medium and heavy trucks (+35.3%) all posted gains. Used automobile sales also saw strong growth in the month, increasing 57.8% from the same month in 2020. The sale of automotive fuel continued to experience strong growth, increasing 21.8% from March of the previous year. This marked the first month of positive growth for the product category since February 2020. This gain was spurred by higher prices at the pump, which rose 35.3% from March 2020. Food sales fall sharply in March following 2020 stockpiling As a result of consumer stockpiling in March 2020, food sales posted the largest decline in the sector in March, down 8.4% year over year. This was the first decline for the product category since September 2019. Non-perishable food options that were among the most sought-after in March 2020 saw the largest drops, with packaged food dry goods n.e.c. (-23.6%), fresh meat and poultry (-9.6%), and frozen food (-11.1%) posting the biggest declines in the month. Soft drinks and alcoholic beverages rose 4.3%. Sales in this product category were buoyed by growth in alcoholic beverages (+5.4%), which compensated for declining sales of other beverage types in the month. With retail sales returning to normal levels in 2021, many products affected by panic buying in March of 2020 saw sharp declines. Among the most affected were miscellaneous household supplies n.e.c. (-26.2%), household cleaning supplies (-16.7%), and non-prescription pharmaceuticals (-31.4%). Conversely, many products that were neglected during the panic buying at the onset of the pandemic experienced strong year-over-year growth as spending returned to normal, including eyewear (+63.4%), clothing (+64.2%) and footwear (+89.1%). Non-essential spending soars As spring approached, home improvement remained a fixture of the pandemic, resulting in record sales of hardware, tools, and renovation and lawn and garden products, which rose 59.7% compared with the same month a year prior. This growth was due in large part to an increase in sales of renovation materials and supplies, as strong demand and higher prices for lumber resulted in a 56.2% advance year over year. With Canadians preparing to enjoy the summer amid the pandemic, many non-essential products saw strong growth in the month, including recreational vehicles (+111.8%), bicycles and biking equipment and accessories (+107.3%), golf equipment (+297.4%) and hunting, fishing and camping equipment (+31.9%). Table 1 Sales by type of commodity, all retail stores – Seasonally unadjusted Note to readers The Retail Commodity Survey collects national-level retail sales data, by commodity, from the same businesses surveyed in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey. No data have been seasonally adjusted. All percentage changes are year over year. New retail commodity data for e-commerce now available Estimates from the Retail Commodity Survey are now available for the electronic shopping and mail-order houses industry (North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] code 454110). E-commerce figures from brick-and-mortar retailers are included with the retailer's commodity sales. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they are classified under NAICS code 45411 (electronic shopping and mail-order houses). Businesses commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers are also classified under NAICS code 45411. Total retail sales figures do not include sales from retailers classified under NAICS code 45411.

This compares with a 3% decline in overall employment. A new study released today, ""Child care workers in Canada,"" presents an overview of the personal and job characteristics of child care workers in Canada and how these characteristics may have changed over time. The study shows that nearly 302,000 people were employed as child care workers in 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast majority of them were women, accounting for 96% of early childhood educators and assistants, as well as home child care providers. It also found that child care workers were younger than the average worker in Canada, were overrepresented among immigrant workers and were more likely to be self-employed. In addition, the study found that they earned, on average, less than half the income of other workers. The study, based on data from the Labour Force Survey and the 2016 Census, also examines how this specific group of workers has been impacted by the pandemic. Immigrants and non-permanent residents are overrepresented among home child care workers Immigrants and non-permanent residents were overrepresented among child care workers, particularly home child care workers. In 2016, 33% of child care workers were immigrants or non-permanent residents, compared with 25% of all other workers. Those working as home child care providers were much more likely than early childhood educators and assistants to be non-permanent residents (11% versus 1%), and somewhat more likely than early childhood educators and assistants to be immigrants (33% versus 27%). In addition, child care workers were more likely than all other workers to belong to a population group designated as a visible minority. Specifically, 39% of home child care providers belonged to such a group, compared with 24% of early childhood educators and assistants and 21% of all other workers. Filipino workers were particularly overrepresented among home child care providers—21% of all workers in this occupation in Canada were Filipinos, compared with 3% for all other occupations. Quebec has the highest proportion of child care workers Based on data from the 2016 Census, Ontario (35%) and Quebec (33%) accounted for the largest share of child care workers, reflecting their larger proportion of the total employed population. When the distributions of early childhood educators and assistants and home child care providers are examined separately by province and territory, early childhood educators and assistants were more likely to work in Quebec; however, Ontario had proportionally more home child care providers. In Quebec, the higher number of early childhood educators and assistants relative to home child care providers can be explained in part by the high number of organized child care establishments (centres de la petite enfance). The ratio of child care workers to the total employed population also varied by province and territory. In 2016, Quebec (2.4%) had the highest proportion of child care workers among all provinces and territories, while Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador had the lowest (1.2% each). These differences can be explained in part by provincial and territorial differences in child care programs. For example, Quebec's partially subsidized child care program offers the lowest cost of child care in Canada and, as a result, a greater proportion of parents use child care services in this province. Other factors, such as the age structure of the population, family composition and the employment characteristics of mothers, at the provincial and territorial level, may also explain these differences. Chart 1 Child care workers as a proportion of the total employed population, by province or territory, 2016 In 2019, one in four child care workers is self-employed Data from the Labour Force Survey show that child care workers were more likely to be self-employed than other workers. In 2019, 25% were self-employed, compared with 15% among all other workers. Child care workers who were paid employees were less likely than other workers to be members of a union or to be covered by a collective agreement (26% vs. 31%), and to have a permanent job (82% vs. 88%). Furthermore, they earned less than other workers overall. In 2015, the average annual employment income of all child care workers ($24,100) was less than half that of other workers ($53,800). This difference was particularly pronounced for home child care providers, whose earnings ($17,300) were notably lower than those of early childhood educators and assistants ($26,800). Despite the recent employment losses in this sector during the pandemic, the number of child care workers is expected to grow, in response to the planned investment in the 2021 federal budget for a new Canada-wide early learning and child care plan. Note to readers Two sources of data are used in this study: the 1991 and 2016 censuses of population and the Labour Force Survey from 1987 to 2019. The data used in the study are restricted to the employed population, aged 15 and older. The 2016 National Occupational Classification (NOC) is used to identify child care workers. Early childhood educators and assistants (NOC code 4214): Early childhood educators plan, organize and implement programs for children aged 0 to 12. Early childhood educator assistants provide care for infants and preschool- to school-age children under the guidance of early childhood educators. Early childhood educators and assistants lead children in activities to stimulate and develop their intellectual, physical and emotional growth and ensure their security and well-being. They are employed in child care or daycare centres, kindergartens, agencies for exceptional children, and other settings where early childhood education services are provided. They can also be self-employed. Supervisors of early childhood educators and assistants are also included in this group. Home child care providers (NOC code 4411): These workers care for children on an ongoing or short-term basis. They care for the well-being and physical and social development of children, assist parents with child care, and may also assist with household duties.

The decline coincided with the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and was the largest decline in retail sales since April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. The largest declines were observed in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-28.6%) and general merchandise stores (-8.1%). Sales decreased in 9 of 11 subsectors, representing 74.2% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—decreased 7.6%. In volume terms, retail sales decreased 5.6% in April. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. In light of continuing restrictions, both retailers and consumers have adapted to these business conditions. Based on respondent feedback, 5.0% of retailers were closed at some point in April, compared with approximately one-third of retailers being closed at the same time last year. The average length of the shutdown was one day, compared with eight days in April 2020. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 3.2% in May. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 62% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 91%. Chart 1 Retail sales decrease in April Widespread declines in core retail sales amid COVID-19 third wave restrictions Core retail sales fell 7.6% in April, the largest decline in a year and second largest decline on record. The decline was concentrated in those retailers deemed ""non-essential,"" with all store types except food and beverage stores (+0.6%) and miscellaneous store retailers (+0.9%) posting declines. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores fell 28.6% in April. The decline was led by lower sales at clothing stores (-31.3%) and shoe stores (-32.1%). In April, 22.0% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of five days. This represented a widespread re-closing of stores, as 5.1% of clothing and clothing accessories stores reported closures in March. Sales declined by 8.1% at general merchandise stores. This was the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Despite the decline in sales, only 0.6% of general merchandise stores were closed during April. Stores may have been impacted in other ways such as restrictions on the types of products they could sell. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers declined for the first time in nine months (-10.4%). Despite the decline, sales remained above levels reached in February 2021. The decline comes after record sales of hardware, tools, and renovation and lawn and garden products in March. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations fall for the first time in four months Sales fell by 1.4% at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Sales were down in all four subsectors, led by new car dealers (-1.1%) and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (-3.5%). Sales at gasoline stations fell 4.1% in April. Gasoline prices were on the rise in April, in part due to production cuts by OPEC+ countries (countries from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus). In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations declined 3.5%. Chart 2 Sales decrease in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales down in seven provinces In Ontario, sales declined 13.4%, the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Sales declined 8.7% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, whereas sales fell by 16.3% in the rest of the province. The decline in sales was largest at general merchandise stores and clothing and clothing accessories stores. Quebec (-1.8%) posted the second largest provincial decline. In the CMA of Montréal, sales fell 0.3%, and in the rest of Quebec, sales declined 3.1%. Sales remained flat in the Atlantic provinces (-0.0%). Second consecutive increases in New Brunswick (+1.9%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (+1.5%) were offset by lower sales in Nova Scotia (-2.3%) and Prince Edward Island (-0.4%). Retail e-commerce in Canada On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 0.4% in April. On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 7.4% year over year to $4.0 billion in April, accounting for 7.0% of total retail trade. The share of e-sales out of total retail sales rose 0.4 percentage points in April. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

Since not everyone infected with the virus may have been tested, the true number of cases among the total Canadian population is likely higher. Antibodies are the body's defence against infections from a virus such as SARS-CoV-2. A blood test can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to a previous infection, or after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The proportion of Canadians who have these antibodies is referred to as the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Statistics Canada, in partnership with Canada's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada, conducted the Canadian COVID-19 Antibody and Health Survey (CCAHS) to better understand the actual spread of the virus in Canada by estimating how many Canadians over the age of 1 and living in private households have antibodies in their blood against the virus. Data were collected from November 2020 to April 2021. First results of the CCAHS show that about 2.6% of Canadians living in private households had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 due to a past infection. Few Canadians protected against SARS-CoV-2 during the study period Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined using a new leading-edge laboratory test which, when combined with respondent questionnaire data, was able to distinguish whether the respondent had antibodies due to a past infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies due to having received a COVID-19 vaccine. Overall, 3.6%, or fewer than 1 in 25 Canadians, had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood from a previous infection or vaccination, which may indicate some degree of protection against future infection from SARS-CoV-2. About 2.6% of Canadians had antibodies due to a past infection, while about 1% of Canadians had antibodies due to a vaccination, reflecting the fact that vaccination was not widespread during the survey period. A larger proportion of males than females had antibodies due to past infection Antibody seroprevalence due to a previous infection was slightly higher in males (2.8%) than females (2.4%). Early in the vaccination campaign, women were significantly more likely than men to have been vaccinated. This could explain why nationally, antibody seroprevalence due to vaccination in females (1.5%) was more than three times higher than in males (0.4%). Due to the higher proportion of females having antibodies due to vaccination, overall antibody seroprevalence (due to past infection, having received a vaccine, or both) was slightly higher among women (3.9%) than men (3.3%). Antibody seroprevalence due to past infection higher in younger age groups The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 3.4% among children and youth aged 1 to 19 years. Antibody seroprevalence due to vaccination in this age group was too low to report accurately, therefore nearly all of the antibody seroprevalence observed in Canadians aged 1 to 19 was due to a previous infection. Initially, at least one COVID-19 vaccine was approved by Health Canada for youth aged 16 to 19. However, this age group was not a priority for early vaccination. A COVID-19 vaccine was approved in May 2021 for children aged 12 to 15, after the survey study period. In comparison, the seroprevalence of antibodies due to past infection among Canadian adults was 2.9% for those aged 20 to 59 and 1.4% for those aged 60 and older. Estimates for the Canadian population aged 60 and older do not include those living in an institutional setting, such as a retirement home or in a long-term care setting. Taking into account both vaccine-induced and antibodies acquired through a past infection, overall antibody seroprevalence was highest within Canadians adults aged 20 to 59 (4.5%). Among those aged 60 and older, overall antibody seroprevalence was 2.1%. Antibody seroprevalence due to past infection or vaccine varied across the country SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence due to a past infection was higher in Alberta (4.0%), followed by Quebec (3.2%), Saskatchewan (2.9%), Ontario (2.5%), Manitoba (2.4%) and British Columbia (1.6%). The proportion of Canadian adults aged 20 and older with antibodies due to vaccination was similar across these provinces, accounting for about one in three adults with antibodies. Taking into account antibody seroprevalence from both vaccination and past infection, Alberta (5.6%) had the highest overall antibody seroprevalence followed by Quebec (4.4%), Saskatchewan (4.1%), Ontario (3.3%), Manitoba (3.1%) and British Columbia (2.4%). Within the territories and Atlantic regions, antibody seroprevalence due to vaccination accounted for the majority of the antibody seroprevalence. About 1 in 5 (21.1%) territorial residents had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to vaccination. Antibody seroprevalence due to past infection was too low to produce a reliable statistical estimate. The Atlantic Region, which comprises the four Atlantic provinces, had the lowest antibody seroprevalence due to past infection (0.5%), and the lowest overall antibody seroprevalence (1.3%). In this region, about two out of every three adults aged 20 and older with antibodies in their blood had them due to vaccination. To obtain reliable seroprevalence estimates, the four Atlantic provinces were grouped together, as were the three territories. Visible minority Canadians had a higher antibody seroprevalence due to a past infection than non-visible minorities Visible minority Canadians (4.3%) had a higher proportion of antibodies acquired through past infection compared to non-visible minority Canadians (2.1%). This contributed to a higher overall SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among visible minorities (4.8%) compared to non-visible minorities (3.3%). One in three Canadians who had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to a previous infection had never been tested before Not all Canadians displaying SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from a previous infection may have known that they had COVID-19. Among Canadians with these antibodies, about one in three (30.3%) reported never having taken a COVID-19 nasal or throat swab test. From this group, three out of four, (76.6%) indicated that it was because they did not have symptoms. While this statistic alone does not estimate the degree of asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population, it does confirm that asymptomatic spread contributed to infection rates.

The survey was administered by Statistics Canada in collaboration with Canada's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada. From November 2020 to April 2021, Canadians aged 1 and older living in private households were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) through the CCAHS. Data were collected across four collection periods, with the bulk of collection completed in January and February 2021. Survey weights were adjusted to minimize any potential bias that could arise from survey non-response; non-response adjustments and calibration using available auxiliary information were also applied and are reflected in the survey weights provided with the data file. Some additional auxiliary information from provincial COVID-19 case counts was also used to make weight adjustments. In addition to survey weights, an extra variance adjustment was applied to account for expected variability from the laboratory test. Despite adjustments and calibrations reflected in the survey weights, the high degree of non-response to the survey increases the risk of remaining bias. This remaining bias may impact estimates produced using the survey data. Results tables containing 95% confidence intervals are available. Confidence intervals are used to express the precision of the estimate. A 95% confidence interval indicates that the true proportion in the population will be between the lower and upper confidence interval 95 times out of 100. Some estimates may not add correctly due to rounding. Studies from other countries have aimed to determine their national seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at different points in time. A study from July 2020 showed that the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the United Kingdom was 6.0%. In the United States, a study ending in September 2020 indicated that fewer than one in ten Americans had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at that time. As the national vaccination campaign for the Canadian population was starting through the survey collection period, the data represent the percentage of Canadians who had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to either an infection, vaccination, or both when referring to overall antibody seroprevalence. When the respondent likely had antibodies due to both infection and vaccination, they were counted as having antibodies due to an infection. Laboratory data were used in combination with questionnaire response data to help determine whether a sample contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 due to a previous infection or vaccination. In some instances, only overall seroprevalence was reported, or provincial estimates were combined to produce a reliable estimate at a regional level. Careful interpretation is therefore required when attempting to draw conclusions about some antibody seroprevalence estimates. Populations excluded from the CCAHS include persons living in the rural areas of the three territories (outside of the capitals); persons living on reserves and other Indigenous settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian Forces; persons living in institutions and residents of certain remote regions. Estimates for the territories were therefore determined by sampling residents of the three territorial capitals. National, provincial and territorial COVID-19 case counts from public health authorities would include these populations excluded from the CCAHS.

Following four consecutive months of reaching new highs, the total value of building permits dropped a record $1.6 billion (-14.8%) to $9.5 billion in May. Every component was down, with multi-family dwellings in Ontario accounting for nearly three fifths of the overall national decline. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits decreased 14.5% to $7.1 billion. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, May 2021 Multi-family permits in Ontario pull residential sector down The value of permits for multi-family dwellings dropped 20.6% to $3.3 billion in May, the lowest value since August 2020. Ontario was responsible for the majority of the decline. All provinces except for Newfoundland and Labrador posted a decrease in the value of permits issued for single-family dwellings, which fell 10.6% nationally to $3.2 billion. Quebec accounted for almost half of the national decline, with fewer permits issued in municipalities outside of the census metropolitan areas. Overall, the value of permits issued in the residential sector pulled back 16.0% to $6.5 billion. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Non-residential permits drop due to Ontario and Quebec Construction intentions for the non-residential sector were down 12.2% to $3.0 billion in May, with Ontario and Quebec falling 21.5% and 22.9% respectively. Commercial permits tumbled 15.8% to $1.6 billion overall. Ontario dropped 33.9% as no permit in excess of $25 million was issued for the province in May, compared with six in the previous month, worth a total of $295 million. The value of permits issued for industrial buildings fell 14.6% to $511 million. Seven provinces reported a decline in this component, with Quebec recording the largest decrease. Quebec saw an uptick in April, largely due to a $105 million permit issued for renovations to a mining facility in the municipality of Sept-Îles. The value of institutional permits decreased 3.4% to $900 million. Gains in four provinces, led by British Columbia and Manitoba, were not enough to counter a $115 million decline observed in Quebec.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates have been made available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (for example, single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (for example, apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for June will be released on August 4.

Definitions New housing price index New Housing Price Index (NHPI)Opens a new window is a monthly series that measures changes over time in the contractors' selling prices of new residential houses, where detailed specifications pertaining to each house remain the same between two consecutive periods. The survey covers the following dwelling types: single homes, semi-detached homes and townhouses. Building permits The monthly Building Permits (BPER)Opens a new window survey collects data on the value of permits issued by Canadian municipalities for both residential and non-residential buildings, and the number of residential dwellings authorized. The survey also measures the number of dwelling units demolished. Building Permit data are widely used as a leading indicator for the construction industry since the issuance of a building permit is one of the first steps in the construction process. Housing starts A housing start is defined as the beginning of construction work on a building, usually when the concrete has been poured for the whole of the footing around the structure, or an equivalent stage where a basement will not be part of the structure. For survey methodology, visit the Housing Market Information PortalOpens a new window from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Housing completions A housing completion is defined as the stage at which all the proposed construction work on a dwelling unit has been performed, although under some circumstances a dwelling may be counted as completed where up to 10 per cent of the proposed work remains to be done. For survey methodology, visit the Housing Market Information PortalOpens a new window from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Shelter price index The Shelter price index tracks price changes related to the costs of owning or renting a home. It is one of the 8 major components in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)Opens a new window and, among them, it is the most heavily weighted component, making up over a quarter of the total CPI basket weight (as of the 2015 Basket). Shelter is composed of various sub-components, such as rent, electricity, mortgage interest cost, homeowner’s replacement cost and homeowner’s home and mortgage insurance. Population 15+ Number of persons of working age, 15 years of age and over. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred. For definitions, data sources and methods, consult the Labour Force Survey (LFS)Opens a new window. Employment Number of persons who, during the reference week, worked for pay or profit, or performed unpaid family work or had a job but were not at work due to own illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, labour dispute, vacation, or other reason. Those persons on layoff and persons without work but who had a job to start at a definite date in the future are not considered employed. Estimates in thousands, rounded to the nearest hundred. For definitions, data sources and methods, consult the Labour Force Survey (LFS)Opens a new window. Census metropolitan area A census metropolitan area (CMA) is a large population centre (known as core) together with adjacent fringe and rural areas that have a high degree of social and economic integration with the cores. A CMA has a population of at least 100,000. Seasonal adjustment A seasonally adjusted time series is a monthly or quarterly time series that has been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences. The seasonally adjusted data allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period.

The decline coincided with the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and was the largest decline in retail sales since April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. The largest declines were observed in clothing and clothing accessories stores (-28.6%) and general merchandise stores (-8.1%). Sales decreased in 9 of 11 subsectors, representing 74.2% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—decreased 7.6%. In volume terms, retail sales decreased 5.6% in April. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. In light of continuing restrictions, both retailers and consumers have adapted to these business conditions. Based on respondent feedback, 5.0% of retailers were closed at some point in April, compared with approximately one-third of retailers being closed at the same time last year. The average length of the shutdown was one day, compared with eight days in April 2020. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales declined 3.2% in May. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 62% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 91%. Chart 1 Retail sales decrease in April Widespread declines in core retail sales amid COVID-19 third wave restrictions Core retail sales fell 7.6% in April, the largest decline in a year and second largest decline on record. The decline was concentrated in those retailers deemed ""non-essential,"" with all store types except food and beverage stores (+0.6%) and miscellaneous store retailers (+0.9%) posting declines. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores fell 28.6% in April. The decline was led by lower sales at clothing stores (-31.3%) and shoe stores (-32.1%). In April, 22.0% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of five days. This represented a widespread re-closing of stores, as 5.1% of clothing and clothing accessories stores reported closures in March. Sales declined by 8.1% at general merchandise stores. This was the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Despite the decline in sales, only 0.6% of general merchandise stores were closed during April. Stores may have been impacted in other ways such as restrictions on the types of products they could sell. Sales at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers declined for the first time in nine months (-10.4%). Despite the decline, sales remained above levels reached in February 2021. The decline comes after record sales of hardware, tools, and renovation and lawn and garden products in March. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers and gasoline stations fall for the first time in four months Sales fell by 1.4% at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Sales were down in all four subsectors, led by new car dealers (-1.1%) and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (-3.5%). Sales at gasoline stations fell 4.1% in April. Gasoline prices were on the rise in April, in part due to production cuts by OPEC+ countries (countries from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus). In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations declined 3.5%. Chart 2 Sales decrease in 9 of 11 subsectors Sales down in seven provinces In Ontario, sales declined 13.4%, the largest decline since the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. Sales declined 8.7% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto, whereas sales fell by 16.3% in the rest of the province. The decline in sales was largest at general merchandise stores and clothing and clothing accessories stores. Quebec (-1.8%) posted the second largest provincial decline. In the CMA of Montréal, sales fell 0.3%, and in the rest of Quebec, sales declined 3.1%. Sales remained flat in the Atlantic provinces (-0.0%). Second consecutive increases in New Brunswick (+1.9%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (+1.5%) were offset by lower sales in Nova Scotia (-2.3%) and Prince Edward Island (-0.4%). Retail e-commerce in Canada On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce fell 0.4% in April. On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 7.4% year over year to $4.0 billion in April, accounting for 7.0% of total retail trade. The share of e-sales out of total retail sales rose 0.4 percentage points in April. Table 1 Retail sales by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes.

This marked the largest increase on record for the sector, due in large part to the sharp declines seen at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Higher sales were reported in 16 of the 19 commodity categories. Looking ahead to April, the advance estimate provided by the Monthly Retail Trade Survey suggests that unadjusted total retail sales increased by 60.1%. Because of its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. Automotive sales accelerate into March Strong sales of motor vehicles in March, coupled with sharp declines at the onset of the pandemic a year earlier, resulted in record growth on a year-over-year basis for the product category (+75.1%). This was the largest gain among all categories in dollar terms. Growth in automotive sales was driven largely by higher sales of new motor vehicles (+85.8%), as new minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks (+89.5%), new passenger automobiles (+70.5%), and medium and heavy trucks (+35.3%) all posted gains. Used automobile sales also saw strong growth in the month, increasing 57.8% from the same month in 2020. The sale of automotive fuel continued to experience strong growth, increasing 21.8% from March of the previous year. This marked the first month of positive growth for the product category since February 2020. This gain was spurred by higher prices at the pump, which rose 35.3% from March 2020. Food sales fall sharply in March following 2020 stockpiling As a result of consumer stockpiling in March 2020, food sales posted the largest decline in the sector in March, down 8.4% year over year. This was the first decline for the product category since September 2019. Non-perishable food options that were among the most sought-after in March 2020 saw the largest drops, with packaged food dry goods n.e.c. (-23.6%), fresh meat and poultry (-9.6%), and frozen food (-11.1%) posting the biggest declines in the month. Soft drinks and alcoholic beverages rose 4.3%. Sales in this product category were buoyed by growth in alcoholic beverages (+5.4%), which compensated for declining sales of other beverage types in the month. With retail sales returning to normal levels in 2021, many products affected by panic buying in March of 2020 saw sharp declines. Among the most affected were miscellaneous household supplies n.e.c. (-26.2%), household cleaning supplies (-16.7%), and non-prescription pharmaceuticals (-31.4%). Conversely, many products that were neglected during the panic buying at the onset of the pandemic experienced strong year-over-year growth as spending returned to normal, including eyewear (+63.4%), clothing (+64.2%) and footwear (+89.1%). Non-essential spending soars As spring approached, home improvement remained a fixture of the pandemic, resulting in record sales of hardware, tools, and renovation and lawn and garden products, which rose 59.7% compared with the same month a year prior. This growth was due in large part to an increase in sales of renovation materials and supplies, as strong demand and higher prices for lumber resulted in a 56.2% advance year over year. With Canadians preparing to enjoy the summer amid the pandemic, many non-essential products saw strong growth in the month, including recreational vehicles (+111.8%), bicycles and biking equipment and accessories (+107.3%), golf equipment (+297.4%) and hunting, fishing and camping equipment (+31.9%). Table 1 Sales by type of commodity, all retail stores – Seasonally unadjusted Note to readers The Retail Commodity Survey collects national-level retail sales data, by commodity, from the same businesses surveyed in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey. No data have been seasonally adjusted. All percentage changes are year over year. New retail commodity data for e-commerce now available Estimates from the Retail Commodity Survey are now available for the electronic shopping and mail-order houses industry (North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] code 454110). E-commerce figures from brick-and-mortar retailers are included with the retailer's commodity sales. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they are classified under NAICS code 45411 (electronic shopping and mail-order houses). Businesses commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers are also classified under NAICS code 45411. Total retail sales figures do not include sales from retailers classified under NAICS code 45411.

Approximately 1.7 million Canadians received regular Employment Insurance (EI) benefits in May, up 83,000 (+5.2%) from a month earlier. Nova Scotia, Alberta and British Columbia reported the largest increases in beneficiaries. May EI statistics reflect labour market conditions as of the week of May 9 to 15. Ahead of the reference week, tighter public health measures continued or were introduced in several provinces. In Ontario, a stay-at-home order implemented on April 8 continued, affecting many non-essential businesses. Both Alberta and Manitoba introduced measures that included the closure of personal care services, recreational facilities and in-person dining, as well as limits on retail store capacity. Nova Scotia entered a province-wide shutdown on April 28 that closed non-essential retail stores, followed by tightened measures at the provincial border on May 10. In contrast, public health measures were eased in some regions of New Brunswick and Quebec in late April and early May. More Canadians collect regular EI benefits in May Approximately 1.7 million Canadians received regular EI benefits in May, up 83,000 (+5.2%) from a month earlier. According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment fell by 68,000 in May, while unemployment held steady at 1.7 million, including 1.4 million Canadians who were looking for work and 200,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Chart 1 Regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries up in May Young women more likely than other age groups to qualify for regular EI under the new rules In late September 2020, temporary changes to the EI program, including a reduction in the number of insured hours required to qualify for benefits, were introduced to increase EI eligibility. In May, 16.2% of regular EI recipients—including more than one-quarter (28.1%) of young women aged 15 to 24—qualified under these new eligibility criteria (not seasonally adjusted). Almost one-fifth (19.0%) of regular EI recipients who last worked in retail trade qualified for the program under the new rules (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Proportion of regular beneficiaries qualifying for Employment Insurance under the new rules in May, by age group and sex (not seasonally adjusted) The increase in regular EI beneficiaries concentrated in Nova Scotia, Alberta and British Columbia The number of regular EI beneficiaries rose in eight provinces in May, led by Nova Scotia (+24,000; +47.0%), Alberta (+23,000; +12.6%) and British Columbia (+17,000; +9.4%), reflecting tightened public health measures in these provinces. May LFS results indicated that employment fell in Nova Scotia (-22,000; -4.8%) and was little changed in Alberta and British Columbia. At the same time, there were fewer regular EI beneficiaries in Ontario (-7,000; -1.1%), while Newfoundland and Labrador showed little change. On a regional basis, the census metropolitan areas of Calgary, Halifax and Vancouver accounted for more than one-third (34.7%) of the monthly increase in regular EI beneficiaries. Just over two in five regular EI recipients worked in industries providing in-person services In May, more than two in five (41.8%) regular EI recipients last worked in one of four industries providing in-person services, including 18.1% in accommodation and food services; 12.7% in retail trade; 5.7% in other services; and 5.3% in information, culture and recreation (not seasonally adjusted). Further illustrating the impact of the pandemic response measures, May LFS results showed that employment in these same industries was below pre-COVID levels by a total of 664,000. Chart 3 Just over 2 in 5 regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries last worked in industries providing in-person services (not seasonally adjusted) Women account for all of the monthly increase in regular EI recipients In May, 88,000 (+10.5%) more women received regular EI benefits compared with a month earlier, while there was little change among men. This is consistent with May LFS results, which showed that employment among women fell by 54,000, while there was little change among men. Women accounted for more than half of regular EI beneficiaries in each of the three main age groups, compared with about one-third in February 2020. Youth aged 15 to 24 accounted for 16.9% of total regular EI recipients in May, up from 9.1% in February 2020. The share of young women (+10.5 percentage points) collecting regular EI benefits has grown at almost twice the pace of young men (+5.6 percentage points) over this period. June LFS results indicated that, compared with February 2020, employment was down by a similar proportion for young women (-72,000; -5.6%) and young men (-54,000; -4.1%). From November 2020 to May 2021, employment was further from pre-COVID levels for young women than for young men. Long-term unemployment reflected in EI benefits May LFS results indicated that the number of long-term unemployed Canadians continued to increase in May, as many of those who lost their jobs in the spring, summer or fall of 2020 remained unemployed. Almost one-third (28.9%) of all unemployed in May had been without work for 27 weeks or more, compared with 15.6% in February 2020. The challenges faced by many workers in returning to employment are also reflected in EI data. In May, almost two-thirds (65.4%) of regular EI recipients had received regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) in at least 7 of the last 12 months, up from 16.1% in February 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Among these longer-term regular EI recipients, just over half (50.6%) were women and 57.9% were core-aged (aged 25 to 54 years) (not seasonally adjusted). By province, the proportion of EI recipients who had received regular EI or CERB benefits in at least 7 of the last 12 months ranged from 69.1% in Newfoundland and Labrador to 59.9% in Nova Scotia (not seasonally adjusted). Next release June EI results will reflect the impact on regular EI recipients following the easing of public health measures in several provinces since late May. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits, by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits, by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports reporting on global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 pandemic period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward comprise individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit). Concepts and methodology The analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program, but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March 2020 to May 2021 have been treated as outliers in determining a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The number of regular EI beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from May 9 to 15. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals who qualified for EI only as a result of these program changes. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined by integrating EI data with record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. EI beneficiaries by number of months on EI or Canada Emergency Response Benefit over the previous 12 months This supplementary indicator presents the number of regular EI recipients who received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for a defined number of total months over the previous 12 months. A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – Definitions for more information. Data availability Data tables 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337 remain suspended as of the December 2019 reference period, because of occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is ongoing to identify a solution to continue publishing the tables. Data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008 remain suspended as of the March 2020 reference period because a source data file contains records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries who could not be identified and excluded through processing. In the data table 14-10-0009, for the March 2020 to September 2020 reference periods, subaggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed because of data quality. Next release Data on EI for June will be released on August 19.

Wholesale sales continue to rise Sales of wholesale goods rose 0.5% in May to $72.2 billion, the third consecutive monthly increase. More than 95% of the gain came from the food, beverage and tobacco subsector, which reported growth of 2.7%. Sales were higher in four of the seven subsectors, representing 72% of total wholesale sales. Wholesale volumes fell 0.3% in May. Chart 1 Wholesale sales increase in May Wholesale sector strong over the year leading up to May 2021 Since reaching a low of $49.0 billion in April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, sales have risen in 11 of the 13 months. In May 2021, they were 11.0% higher than the pre-pandemic level in February 2020. The 10 months with the highest sales of all time in the sector were the 10 months from August 2020 to May 2021, with May 2021 being the highest month on record. The sustained increase in sales in the sector reflects the variety of services that wholesalers provide, even with the shifts in economic activity brought on by the pandemic. While sectors such as transportation, tourism and hospitality have all suffered significant declines, wholesalers have benefited from the increased demand for building materials, machinery (including computer and electronic products), and personal and household goods. Food, beverage and tobacco subsector sales spur gains Higher sales in the wholesale sector were largely the result of 2.7% growth in the food, beverage and tobacco subsector. All of the gains came from the food industry, as sales jumped 3.3% to $11.4 billion, the highest level since March 2020. Food sales have risen for five consecutive months. The increase reflects the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, which enabled more restaurants to open with limited capacity and allowed Canadians to meet in larger groups. Sales of machinery, equipment and supplies rose 0.5% in May, with strong increases in sales of construction, forestry, mining, and industrial machinery, equipment and supplies, and of computer and communications equipment and supplies. These were largely offset by a large drop in the sales of farm, lawn and garden machinery and equipment. The increase in the subsector was the fourth in five months. Building material and supplies wholesalers posted their 12th increase in 13 months as sales rose 0.5% to $13.1 billion. The increase came as prices for lumber and other wood products rose for the sixth consecutive month—up 17.9% in May, according to the Industrial Product Price Index. Gains were also reported in the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories subsector. Port of Montréal strike Approximately 15% of respondents said their business was impacted by the strike at the Port of Montréal in April and May, causing a loss of approximately $230 million in wholesale sales. Among respondents who said their business was affected, approximately two-thirds said they experienced delivery delays. Some businesses rerouted inbound containers to ports in New York and Halifax, increasing shipping and logistical costs and sparking delays ranging from three weeks to almost nine weeks. Provinces from Quebec westward experienced the most significant delays in transport, with many businesses in Alberta, Ontario and Manitoba being moderately affected. While some businesses increased their inventories in anticipation of the disruption, many experienced raw material shortages. Some respondents said that they reacted to labour disruptions at the Port of Montréal by changing how they transport goods, such as shipping them via air or using a different port. Others noted that they used alternate delivery methods to respond to the labour disruption and said they incurred higher costs and delays. Ontario leads gains in wholesale sales in May Sales rose in four provinces and two territories in May, representing 64% of total national wholesale sales. Ontario alone accounted for 49% of the sector's sales. Ontario led the growth, reporting $35.6 billion in sales, a 1.3% gain, followed by British Columbia, with an increase of 5.3% to $8.2 billion in May. In Ontario, the food, beverage and tobacco subsector accounted for half of the province's increase, with a 6.1% rise in sales in May, 98% of which came from the food industry. In addition, sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector rose 2.0%, reflecting a 21.0% increase in sales in the construction, forestry, mining, and industrial machinery, equipment and supplies industry. Sales in British Columbia reached a record high for the third consecutive month. The building material and supplies subsector had the largest growth, up 4.6% from April. This gain was predominantly attributable to a 6.7% increase in the lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies industry, spurred by increased prices of lumber and other wood products. Quebec had the largest decline, with sales falling 1.2% to $14.4 billion in May, following two months of growth. The decline reflects a 10.8% drop in the miscellaneous subsector, which reached its lowest level since February 2021. Following a record high in April, when sales jumped 41.6%, sales subsequently decreased by 49.0% in the agricultural supplies industry, cancelling the gains made in the four other industries in this subsector. Traditionally, May was the strongest month for sales in the industry in Quebec, but in the last two years, unadjusted agricultural supply sales have been stronger in April. Inventory levels grow Wholesale inventories rose 2.1% to $95.0 billion in May, their highest value on record. Inventories in five of the seven subsectors increased, accounting for 82% of the value of inventories for the sector. Inventories of building material and supplies merchant wholesalers grew 5.6% to $16.6 billion, the eighth consecutive increase and a new record for the subsector. Inventories of lumber, millwork, hardware and other building supplies merchant wholesalers grew 9.7% to $8.3 billion. The industry has been growing for 11 months and contributed more than 80% of the growth in the building material and supplies subsector in May. Inventories of personal and household goods merchant wholesalers shrank 4.7% to $16.4 billion, more than offsetting gains made in April, reflecting changes in the two largest component industries. Textile, clothing and footwear wholesalers' inventories decreased 16.1% to $3.3 billion, while personal goods wholesalers' inventories decreased 12.4% to $2.1 billion. Miscellaneous merchant wholesalers' inventories rose 5.8%, largely because of increases in inventories of agricultural supplies wholesalers, which grew 8.4% to $5.0 billion, and other miscellaneous wholesalers, which rose 7.9% to $3.8 billion in May. The inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.32 in May, up from 1.29 in April. The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time (in months) required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain at their current levels. Table 1 Wholesale merchants' sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Wholesale merchants' sales by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Wholesale merchants' inventories by industry – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Total wholesale sales expressed in volume are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using relevant price indexes. The wholesale sales series in chained (2012) dollars is a chained Fisher volume index, with 2012 as the reference year. For more information, see Deflation of wholesale sales. The Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey covers all industries within the wholesale trade sector, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), with the exception of oilseed and grain merchant wholesalers (NAICS 41112); petroleum and petroleum products merchant wholesalers (NAICS 412); and business-to-business electronic markets, and agents and brokers (NAICS 419).

Unfilled orders $87.1 billion May 2021 -4.1% (monthly change) Source(s): Table 16-10-0047-01. Manufacturing sales fell 0.6% to $57.9 billion in May, the second consecutive monthly decline. The machinery, chemical and fabricated metal industries were mainly responsible for the decline. Sales of wood product manufacturing increased the most, followed by primary metal. Year over year, total sales were up 42.6%. Chart 1 Manufacturing sales Sales in constant dollars decreased 2.5% to $48.2 billion in May, the second consecutive decline indicating a lower volume of goods sold as manufacturers continued to deal with supply chain issues. Sales of machinery products declined the most (-16.2%) by volume. The Industrial Product Price Index increased 2.7% in May, on higher prices for lumber and other wood products (+17.9%). Prices of raw materials purchased by manufacturers rose 3.2%. Machinery manufacturing posts the largest decrease Following record high sales in April, sales of machinery declined 16.9% to $3.1 billion in May, mainly due to lower sales of agricultural, construction and mining machinery. On a year-over-year basis, sales were still up 25.7%. A number of machinery manufacturers indicated that the lack of raw materials (including microchips) and delay in shipments affected their production in May. As a result, the industry's capacity utilization rate fell 4.1 percentage points. Chemical product sales decreased 2.0% to $5.2 billion in May, following four consecutive monthly gains. Lower sales in the basic chemicals and pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing industries contributed the most to the decline. Despite the decline in May, total chemical product sales were up 30.1% year over year. Sales in the fabricated metal product industry fell 1.8% to $3.6 billion in May. Lower sales of boiler, tank and shipping containers along with coating, engraving, cold and heat treating and allied products were responsible for the decline. Sales also declined in the food (-0.6%), non-metallic mineral (-2.9%) and motor vehicle parts (-1.4%) industries. The wood product industry marked another record month of sales, rising 6.1% to $5.4 billion in May. Higher prices were responsible for the gain as sales in constant dollars decreased 4.7%. While the total value of building permits issued in Canada fell 14.8%, exports of forestry products and building and packaging materials rose 8.9% in May. Sales in the primary metal industry increased 3.6% to a record $4.9 billion in May, driven by higher sales of alumina and aluminum production and processing. The gains were mainly due to higher prices, as volume sales edged up 0.6%. Ontario posts the largest sales decline Manufacturing sales declined in six provinces in May, led by Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec, while Alberta posted the largest increase. In Ontario, sales were down 1.0% to $24.0 billion in May, due to lower sales in 13 of 21 industries, led by the machinery (-16.2%), chemical (-4.2%), and transportation equipment (-1.2%) industries. Petroleum product sales posted the largest gain (+10.6%). Year over year, total sales were up 43.3%. Following two consecutive increases, sales in Manitoba fell 6.6% to $1.7 billion. This drop was due to lower sales in the food (-7.2%), machinery (-17.8%) and transportation equipment (-16.0%) industries. Sales in Quebec decreased 0.6% to $14.6 billion in May, on lower sales of machinery (-24.0%), petroleum (-5.3%) and chemicals (-4.9%). Year over years, sales in Quebec rose 36.3%. Sales in Alberta rose for the 13th consecutive month, up 1.6% to $7.2 billion in May on higher sales of wood (+11.3%), petroleum (+2.8%) and chemical (+3.0%) products. Year over year, sales in Alberta more than doubled (+52.0%). Sales in Québec decline the most Manufacturing sales on a seasonally adjusted basis fell in seven census metropolitan areas covered by the survey in May, led by Québec and Montréal. Edmonton posted the largest gain. Following a 17.0% decline, sales in Québec decreased 11.1% to $1.1 billion in May, mainly on lower sales of petroleum products. Nevertheless, sales in Québec were up 20.4% compared with May 2020. In Montréal, sales fell 1.9% to $6.4 billion, pulled downward by lower production of aerospace products (-12.3%). However, the aerospace product and part industry in Montréal has seen four monthly increases in sales since January 2020. Sales in Edmonton rose 2.5% to $3.0 billion in May, on higher sales in 10 of 21 industries, led by petroleum products (+2.5%). Inventory levels rise Total inventories rose 0.7% to $90.3 billion in May on higher inventories of chemical (+3.8%), petroleum (+4.3%) and wood (+3.7%) products. The transportation equipment industry posted the largest decline in inventories (-2.8%). Total inventories rose 3.9% year over year. Chart 2 Inventory levels rise The inventory-to-sales ratio edged up from 1.54 in April to 1.56 in May. The ratio measures the time, in months, that would be required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain at their current level. Chart 3 The inventory-to-sales ratio increases Unfilled orders decline Following a 2.0% decrease in April, unfilled orders decreased 4.1% to $87.1 billion in May, led by an 11.3% decline in unfilled orders of aerospace products. Many aerospace manufacturers have been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, which has resulted in several order cancellations since 2020. Chart 4 Unfilled orders decline Total value of new orders fell 4.0% to $54.1 billion in May, pulled downward by a decline in new orders of aerospace products and parts. Capacity utilization rate remains stable The capacity utilization rate (seasonally unadjusted) for the total manufacturing sector was unchanged at 77.5% in May. Chart 5 The capacity utilization rate remains stable The lower capacity utilization rates in the machinery (-4.1 percentage points), chemical product (-2.1 percentage points) and transportation equipment (-1.1 percentage points) industries were offset by high production capacity rates in the petroleum and coal (+4.5 percentage points) and plastic and rubber product (+2.7 percentage points) industries. Table 1 Manufacturing: Principal statistics – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Manufacturing sales by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Manufacturing sales: Provinces and territories – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Manufacturing sales by selected census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 5 Manufacturing capacity utilization rates by industry – Unadjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Monthly Survey of Manufacturing is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Starting with the July 2021 release of May data, seasonally adjusted sales estimates for 12 selected census metropolitan areas (CMAs) will be produced for the first time as part of the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing. Unadjusted and seasonally adjusted estimates of sales of goods manufactured have been compiled from January 2009 to May 2021 and are available in table 16-10-0011-01. Estimates of sales of goods manufactured, inventories and orders in tables 16-10-0047-01 and 16-10-0048-01 have been revised back to January 2018 for unadjusted data, and back to January 2015 for seasonally adjusted data. Real manufacturing sales, orders, inventory owned and inventory-to-sales ratio estimates in table 16-10-0013-01 have been revised back to January 2015. Unadjusted estimates of capacity utilization rates, in table 16-10-0012-01, have been revised back to January 2018. Monthly data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing, leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics and rubber products. Durable goods industries include wood products, non-metallic mineral products, primary metals, fabricated metal products, machinery, computer and electronic products, electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation equipment, furniture and related products, and miscellaneous manufacturing. Production-based industries For the aerospace and shipbuilding industries, the value of production is used instead of the value of sales of goods manufactured. The value of production is calculated by adjusting monthly sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories of goods in process and finished products manufactured. The value of production is used because of the extended period of time that it normally takes to manufacture products in these industries. Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute to future sales, assuming that the orders are not cancelled. New orders are those received, whether sold in the current month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the previous month to the current month. Manufacturers reporting sales, inventories and unfilled orders in US dollars Some Canadian manufacturers report sales, inventories and unfilled orders in US dollars. These data are then converted to Canadian dollars as part of the data production cycle. For sales, based on the assumption that they occur throughout the month, the average monthly exchange rate for the reference month established by the Bank of Canada is used for the conversion. The monthly average exchange rate is available in table 33-10-0163-01. Inventories and unfilled orders are reported at the end of the reference period. For most respondents, the daily average exchange rate on the last working day of the month is used for the conversion of these variables. However, some manufacturers choose to report their data as of a day other than the last day of the month. In these instances, the daily average exchange rate on the day selected by the respondent is used. Note that because of exchange rate fluctuations, the daily average exchange rate on the day selected by the respondent can differ from both the exchange rate on the last working day of the month and the monthly average exchange rate. Daily average exchange rate data are available in table 33-10-0036-01. Revision policy Each month, the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing releases preliminary data for the reference month and revised data for the previous three months. Revisions are made to reflect new information provided by respondents and updates to administrative data. Once a year, a revision project is undertaken to revise multiple years of data. Real-time data tables Real-time data tables 16-10-0118-01, 16-10-0119-01, 16-10-0014-01 and 16-10-0015-01 will be updated on July 23. Next release Data from the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing for June will be released on August 16.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.1% on a year-over-year basis in June, down from a 3.6% gain in May. As a result of price increases in June 2020, base-year effects had a downward impact on consumer inflation, contributing to the slowdown in June 2021. Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 2.2% year over year. The monthly CPI rose 0.3% in June 2021, down from a 0.5% increase in May. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.1% in June. Chart 1 The 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding gasoline Highlights While shelter (+4.4%) and transportation (+5.6%) prices contributed the most to the all-items increase, prices rose at a slower pace in four of the eight major components on a year-over-year basis in June. The headline CPI grew at a slower pace compared with May due in part to a slowdown in price growth for goods. Growth slowed the most in the clothing and footwear component, mostly due to lower prices for women's clothing. Chart 2 Prices rise at a slower pace in four major components Explore the Consumer Price Index Check out the Personal Inflation Calculator!

Check out the Consumer Price Index Data Visualization Tool to access current and historical CPI data in a customizable visual format. Gasoline prices increase at a slower rate On a year-over-year basis, gasoline prices rose to a lesser extent in June (+32.0%) than in May (+43.4%) due to a base-year effect. The slower price growth in June stemmed from an increase in June 2020, when gasoline prices partially recovered after falling significantly during the early stages of the pandemic. Gasoline prices rose 10.5% month over month in June 2020, the result of higher demand as businesses gradually reopened. Infographic 1 Gasoline prices rise at a slower pace on a year-over-year basis Shelter costs continue to rise Year over year growth in shelter costs (+4.4%) continued to increase in June, driven mostly by the continued rise in the homeowners' replacement cost index, up 12.9% in the 12 months to June. Prices for new homes continue to be impacted by shifting consumer preferences as well as higher building costs compared with June 2020. The other owned accommodation expenses index, which includes commissions and legal fees on the sale of real estate, rose 12.0% year over year in June. Conversely, the mortgage interest cost index fell 8.6% year over year, the strongest decline on record, as interest rates remained at historically low levels. Consumers pay less for beef and more for chicken year over year The fresh or frozen beef index fell 11.1%, compared with June 2020 when beef prices rose 8.3% month over month as a result of reduced supply following plant closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks. The year-over-year drop, the largest yearly decline since 1982, was mainly driven by base-year effects. In contrast, prices for fresh or frozen chicken rose 10.6% year over year, the largest increase since 2004, as a base-year effect due to lower prices in June 2020 had an upward impact on the index. On a monthly basis, prices for beef (+0.6%) and chicken (+0.7%) increased compared with May 2021. Chart 3 Beef prices fall and chicken prices rise year over year Prices for fresh vegetables fall for the fourth consecutive month The fresh vegetables index continued to trend downwards in June, falling 7.5% year over year — the largest yearly decline since March 2017. This was partially attributable to lower prices for tomatoes (-30.3%) and potatoes (-7.7%) in June. The declines occurred amid increased supply stemming from favourable weather conditions in growing regions. In addition, the fall in prices for tomatoes was partly driven by a base-year effect as prices rose 16.2% month over month in June 2020 due to lower supply. Chart 4 Yearly changes in prices for fresh vegetables Consumers pay less for cellular phone plans and devices Consumers paid 21.4% less for cellular services on a year-over-year basis in June, following a 17.0% decline in May. The decrease was mainly due to a variety of promotions across the industry offering lower prices for cellular phone plans and bonus data. Prices for multipurpose digital devices, which include smartphones and tablets, fell 13.7% on a year-over-year basis in June, largely due to industry-wide price promotions for various smartphones. Spotlight on supply chains Trade brings many benefits to Canadians, including access to a broader variety of consumer goods. International trade occurs through complex networks of firms—such as manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, among others—who cooperate to produce and deliver finished goods to consumers. This process is known as a supply chain. The global supply chain has grappled with exceptional challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Against a backdrop of input shortages, production bottlenecks, higher shipping costs and delivery delays, and the reopening of some economies, the international flow of raw materials and finished products has experienced disruptions. Strain on the global supply chain has affected the Canadian CPI in a number of ways. For example, in June 2021, a global shortage of semiconductor chips partly contributed to higher year-over-year prices for passenger vehicles (+4.1%). Prices for household appliances (+5.2%), which includes cooking appliances (+6.3%), refrigerators and freezers (+9.8%), and laundry and dishwashing appliances (+7.1%), also increased year over year in June, as supply chain bottlenecks, including higher shipping costs and delays for imported appliances, put upward pressure on the index. As Canada and major trading partners gradually reopen, Statistics Canada will continue to monitor supply chain conditions, and the potential impact on consumer price inflation. Regional highlights Year over year, prices rose at a slower pace in June than in May in every province. Chart 5 The Consumer Price Index rises at a slower pace in all provinces Price growth slows the most in Saskatchewan Among the provinces, price growth in Saskatchewan slowed the most year over year in June (+1.8%) compared with May (+2.7%). Much of this slowdown stemmed from lower prices for passenger vehicle insurance premiums (-24.2%), which fell for the second consecutive month, as a rebate for drivers continued from May. Consumers in Saskatchewan also paid less, on a year-over-year basis, for rent (-0.5%) compared with other provinces.

Join us for our Reddit AMA event on July 29, 2021, at 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time. Basket Update The basket of goods and services used in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been updated with the release of the June 2021 data. For the first time, several new sources of expenditure data were used to ensure the new CPI weights reflect evolving consumer spending patterns, particularly as the country transitions from pandemic response to recovery. The new basket weights are based on 2020 expenditure data, which include information on pre-pandemic expenditures, initial pandemic impacts, some recovery data and the emergence of new consumption patterns. The data reflect shifts in spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic that will likely take some time to stabilize across goods and services, and geographic regions. The new basket weight reference period is 2020, based on the national household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) data, in addition to data from the Survey of Household Spending and provincial HFCE series. Alternative data for 2020 has been used to account for pandemic-related shifts at more detailed levels of geography and CPI components. The base period, in which the CPI is set to equal 100, remains 2002. The headline CPI for June 2021 would have been the same using the 2017 basket weights. For more detailed information, consult the document entitled ""An Analysis of the 2021 Consumer Price Index Basket Update, Based on 2020 Expenditures"" in the Prices Analytical Series (Catalogue number62F0014M) and the infographic entitled ""The Consumer Price Index: Keeping Up with Canadian Consumers"". When will the CPI basket weights be updated again? Statistics Canada will continue to monitor consumer expenditure patterns during the reopening and recovery period. Another weight adjustment is planned for 2022, to account for post-pandemic spending, and to ensure an even greater degree of relevance. Going forward, Statistics Canada will move towards annual weight updates based on the most recent household expenditure data available. Improvements to the Adjusted Price Index are also underway, with the next publication planned towards the end of 2021. COVID-19 and the Consumer Price Index Goods and services in the CPI that were not available to consumers in June due to COVID-19 restrictions received special treatments, effectively removing their impact on the monthly CPI. The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the all-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, personal care services in some areas, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. The price indexes for beer served in licensed establishments, wine served in licensed establishments and liquor served in licensed establishments, as well as air transportation received the same treatments as in May. The details of the treatments from April 2020 to March 2021 are provided in technical supplements available through the Prices Analytical Series. Details and treatments for April 2021 to June 2021 are available upon request. As COVID-19 restrictions ease throughout the country, products and services that were unavailable for consumption in previous months will start to become available. Statistics Canada continues to monitor the impacted sectors and will remove these special treatments and reintroduce monthly pricing as the goods and services become widely available for consumption. Real-time data tables The real-time data table (18-10-0259-01) will be updated on August 9. For more information, consult the document ""Real-time tables."" Next release The CPI for July will be released on August 18. Products The ""Consumer Price Index Data Visualization Tool"" is available on the Statistics Canada website.

Retail sales declined 2.1% to $53.8 billion in May. The largest declines occurred at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers (-11.3%) and motor vehicle and parts dealers (-2.4%). During the month of May, many retailers continued to face closures due to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales decreased in 8 of 11 subsectors, representing 65.6% of retail trade. Core retail sales—which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicle and parts dealers—decreased 2.4%. In volume terms, retail sales decreased 2.7% in May. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, provincial governments continued to enact public health measures in several regions across the country, which directly affected the retail sector. In light of continuing restrictions, both retailers and consumers have adapted to these business conditions. Based on respondent feedback, 5.6% of retailers were closed at some point in May, compared with approximately 5.0% of retailers being closed the month prior. The average length of the shutdown was one day in both May and April. Despite these challenging times, most respondents reported their sales figures, and Statistics Canada thanks them for their continued collaboration. Given the rapidly evolving economic situation, Statistics Canada is providing an advance estimate of retail sales, which suggests that sales increased 4.4% in June. Owing to its preliminary nature, this figure will be revised. This unofficial estimate was calculated based on responses received from 59.9% of companies surveyed. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 90.5%. Chart 1 Retail sales decrease in May Retail sales continue to fall as non-essential retailers remain closed The largest decline in retail sales occurred at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, down 11.3% in May. Sales decreased for the second consecutive month and retreated 19.3% from the record high reached in March. In May, 4.8% of building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers were closed for at least one day, compared with 1.3% in March. Sales fell by 2.4% at motor vehicle and parts dealers. Sales were down in all four subsectors, led by new car dealers (-2.5%) and automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (-4.3%). The New Motor Vehicle Sales Survey noted that unit sales of passenger cars and trucks were 30.8% higher in May compared with the same month a year earlier. Compared with May 2019, unit sales of passenger cars and trucks were down 27.1% in May. Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores fell 11.2%. In May, 23.5% of clothing and clothing accessories stores were closed for an average of six days. All three store types posted declines, with clothing stores (-11.6%) decreasing the most. Sales at this store type fell to their lowest level since May 2020. Sales rise at food and beverage stores and gasoline stations Receipts rose 0.8% at food and beverage stores. The increase was due to higher sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores (+1.0%) and beer, wine and liquor stores (+0.8%). Sales at gasoline stations (+0.9%) increased for the fourth time in the last five months. Gasoline prices rose in May, largely due to supply disruptions to pipelines in the United States and production cuts by international oil producers. In volume terms, sales at gasoline stations were relatively unchanged (-0.1%). Chart 2 Sales decrease in 8 of 11 subsectors Sales down in eight provinces In Ontario, sales fell 2.1%. This was the fourth decline in the last six months. The decrease in sales was largest at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers. Sales were down by 2.5% in the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto. Quebec (-2.5%) posted the second-largest provincial decline. In the Montréal CMA, sales fell 3.5%, the first decline in four months. Saskatchewan (+1.7%) and Manitoba (+0.3%) were the only provinces where retail sales increased in May. In both provinces, the sales growth was led by higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers. This was the fifth consecutive sales increase in Saskatchewan. Retail e-commerce in Canada On a seasonally adjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales rose 2.1% in May. On an unadjusted basis, retail e-commerce sales were up 3.7% year over year to $4.2 billion in May, accounting for 7.0% of total retail trade. The share of e-commerce sales out of total retail sales was unchanged in May compared with April. Table 1 Retail sales, by province, territory and census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Retail sales, by industry – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Retail sales by industry, at 2012 constant prices – Seasonally adjusted Table 4 Retail e-commerce sales – Unadjusted Note to readers All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise noted. Seasonally adjusted data are data that have been modified to eliminate the effect of seasonal and calendar influences to allow for more meaningful comparisons of economic conditions from period to period. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The percentage change for the advance estimate of retail sales is calculated using seasonally adjusted data and is expressed in current dollars. This early indicator is a special product being provided in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to offer Canadians timely information on the retail sector. The data sources and methodology used are exactly the same as those outlined in the Monthly Retail Trade Survey information page. Trend-cycle estimates are included in selected charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. These data represent a smoothed version of the seasonally adjusted time series and provide information on longer-term movements, including changes in direction underlying the series. For information on trend-cycle data, see Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be extensive and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially for the reference months near the end of the series or during periods of economic disruption. Seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers are presented in unadjusted form since there is no seasonal pattern established by official statistics yet. Establishing such a pattern requires several months of observed data. In the interim, the seasonally adjusted estimates for cannabis store retailers will be identical to the unadjusted figures. Statistics Canada's retail e-commerce figures include the electronic sales of two distinct types of retailers. The first type does not have a storefront. These businesses are commonly referred to as pure-play Internet retailers and are classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 45411—electronic shopping and mail-order houses. The second type has a storefront and is commonly referred to as a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the online operations of a brick-and-mortar retailer are separately managed, they, too, are classified to NAICS code 45411. Some common e-commerce transactions, such as travel and accommodation bookings, ticket purchases, and financial transactions, are not included in Canadian retail sales figures. For more information on retail e-commerce in Canada, see ""Retail E-Commerce in Canada."" Total retail sales expressed in volume terms are calculated by deflating current-dollar values using consumer price indexes. Real-time tables Real-time tables 20-10-0054-01 and 20-10-0079-01 will be updated soon. Next release Data on retail trade for June will be released on August 20.

Approximately 1.7 million Canadians received regular Employment Insurance (EI) benefits in May, up 83,000 (+5.2%) from a month earlier. Nova Scotia, Alberta and British Columbia reported the largest increases in beneficiaries. May EI statistics reflect labour market conditions as of the week of May 9 to 15. Ahead of the reference week, tighter public health measures continued or were introduced in several provinces. In Ontario, a stay-at-home order implemented on April 8 continued, affecting many non-essential businesses. Both Alberta and Manitoba introduced measures that included the closure of personal care services, recreational facilities and in-person dining, as well as limits on retail store capacity. Nova Scotia entered a province-wide shutdown on April 28 that closed non-essential retail stores, followed by tightened measures at the provincial border on May 10. In contrast, public health measures were eased in some regions of New Brunswick and Quebec in late April and early May. More Canadians collect regular EI benefits in May Approximately 1.7 million Canadians received regular EI benefits in May, up 83,000 (+5.2%) from a month earlier. According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment fell by 68,000 in May, while unemployment held steady at 1.7 million, including 1.4 million Canadians who were looking for work and 200,000 who had a connection to a job, either because they were on temporary layoff or had arrangements to begin a new job in the near future. Chart 1 Regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries up in May Young women more likely than other age groups to qualify for regular EI under the new rules In late September 2020, temporary changes to the EI program, including a reduction in the number of insured hours required to qualify for benefits, were introduced to increase EI eligibility. In May, 16.2% of regular EI recipients—including more than one-quarter (28.1%) of young women aged 15 to 24—qualified under these new eligibility criteria (not seasonally adjusted). Almost one-fifth (19.0%) of regular EI recipients who last worked in retail trade qualified for the program under the new rules (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Proportion of regular beneficiaries qualifying for Employment Insurance under the new rules in May, by age group and sex (not seasonally adjusted) The increase in regular EI beneficiaries concentrated in Nova Scotia, Alberta and British Columbia The number of regular EI beneficiaries rose in eight provinces in May, led by Nova Scotia (+24,000; +47.0%), Alberta (+23,000; +12.6%) and British Columbia (+17,000; +9.4%), reflecting tightened public health measures in these provinces. May LFS results indicated that employment fell in Nova Scotia (-22,000; -4.8%) and was little changed in Alberta and British Columbia. At the same time, there were fewer regular EI beneficiaries in Ontario (-7,000; -1.1%), while Newfoundland and Labrador showed little change. On a regional basis, the census metropolitan areas of Calgary, Halifax and Vancouver accounted for more than one-third (34.7%) of the monthly increase in regular EI beneficiaries. Just over two in five regular EI recipients worked in industries providing in-person services In May, more than two in five (41.8%) regular EI recipients last worked in one of four industries providing in-person services, including 18.1% in accommodation and food services; 12.7% in retail trade; 5.7% in other services; and 5.3% in information, culture and recreation (not seasonally adjusted). Further illustrating the impact of the pandemic response measures, May LFS results showed that employment in these same industries was below pre-COVID levels by a total of 664,000. Chart 3 Just over 2 in 5 regular Employment Insurance beneficiaries last worked in industries providing in-person services (not seasonally adjusted) Women account for all of the monthly increase in regular EI recipients In May, 88,000 (+10.5%) more women received regular EI benefits compared with a month earlier, while there was little change among men. This is consistent with May LFS results, which showed that employment among women fell by 54,000, while there was little change among men. Women accounted for more than half of regular EI beneficiaries in each of the three main age groups, compared with about one-third in February 2020. Youth aged 15 to 24 accounted for 16.9% of total regular EI recipients in May, up from 9.1% in February 2020. The share of young women (+10.5 percentage points) collecting regular EI benefits has grown at almost twice the pace of young men (+5.6 percentage points) over this period. June LFS results indicated that, compared with February 2020, employment was down by a similar proportion for young women (-72,000; -5.6%) and young men (-54,000; -4.1%). From November 2020 to May 2021, employment was further from pre-COVID levels for young women than for young men. Long-term unemployment reflected in EI benefits May LFS results indicated that the number of long-term unemployed Canadians continued to increase in May, as many of those who lost their jobs in the spring, summer or fall of 2020 remained unemployed. Almost one-third (28.9%) of all unemployed in May had been without work for 27 weeks or more, compared with 15.6% in February 2020. The challenges faced by many workers in returning to employment are also reflected in EI data. In May, almost two-thirds (65.4%) of regular EI recipients had received regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) in at least 7 of the last 12 months, up from 16.1% in February 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Among these longer-term regular EI recipients, just over half (50.6%) were women and 57.9% were core-aged (aged 25 to 54 years) (not seasonally adjusted). By province, the proportion of EI recipients who had received regular EI or CERB benefits in at least 7 of the last 12 months ranged from 69.1% in Newfoundland and Labrador to 59.9% in Nova Scotia (not seasonally adjusted). Next release June EI results will reflect the impact on regular EI recipients following the easing of public health measures in several provinces since late May. Table 1 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits, by province and territory, sex and age group – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Beneficiaries receiving regular income benefits, by census metropolitan category – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable Development Goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Employment Insurance statistics are an example of how Statistics Canada supports reporting on global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Employment Insurance in the context of broader COVID-19 benefit programs No methodological changes were made to the Employment Insurance Statistics (EIS) program over the COVID-19 pandemic period. EIS reflect the Employment Insurance (EI) program for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week in each month. Data for the October 2020 reference period and onward comprise individuals who obtained EI benefits, and exclude beneficiaries of the Canada recovery benefits (Canada Recovery Benefit, Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, and Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit). Concepts and methodology The analysis focuses on people who received regular EI benefits related to job loss. EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources provided by Service Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative procedures. EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI benefits and should not be confused with LFS data, which provide estimates of the total number of unemployed people. There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not contributed to the program because they have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment was not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed to the program, but do not meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their jobs voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive benefits. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted, unless otherwise specified. Values for all series from March 2020 to May 2021 have been treated as outliers in determining a seasonal pattern for seasonal adjustment. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The number of regular EI beneficiaries for the current month and the previous month is subject to revision. The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who received regular EI benefits from May 9 to 15. This period coincides with the reference week of the LFS. Beneficiaries who qualified for EI under the new EI rules introduced in September 2020 Temporary changes to the EI program that provided all new regular EI beneficiaries with a one-time credit of 300 insurable hours were introduced on September 27, 2020. In addition, the unemployment rate used to calculate their eligibility and entitlement weeks was 13.1%, unless their region's unemployment rate was higher. This supplementary indicator presents the number of individuals who qualified for EI only as a result of these program changes. EI beneficiaries by industry The industry of EI beneficiaries is determined by integrating EI data with record of employment administrative data. For beneficiaries with more than one record of employment in the past 52 weeks, the records with the greatest number of hours are used. If no industry information can be found, industry information is deemed ""Not classified"" for the beneficiary. EI beneficiaries by number of months on EI or Canada Emergency Response Benefit over the previous 12 months This supplementary indicator presents the number of regular EI recipients who received either regular EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for a defined number of total months over the previous 12 months. A census metropolitan area (CMA) or census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000. A CA must have a population of at least 10,000. See Standard Geographical Classification 2016 – Definitions for more information. Data availability Data tables 14-10-0336 and 14-10-0337 remain suspended as of the December 2019 reference period, because of occupational coding issues from the source data file. Work is ongoing to identify a solution to continue publishing the tables. Data tables 14-10-0004, 14-10-0005, 14-10-0007 and 14-10-0008 remain suspended as of the March 2020 reference period because a source data file contains records for CERB claimants and beneficiaries who could not be identified and excluded through processing. In the data table 14-10-0009, for the March 2020 to September 2020 reference periods, subaggregates of the parent ""regular benefits"" benefit type have been suppressed because of data quality. Next release Data on EI for June will be released on August 19.

For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality. Footnote 2 A census metropolitan area (CMA) is a large population centre (known as core) together with adjacent fringe and rural areas that have a high degree of social and economic integration with the cores. A CMA has a population of at least 100,000. Footnote 3 Excluding the territories. Footnote 4 The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed persons expressed as a percentage of the labour force. The unemployment rate for a particular group (age, sex, marital status, etc.) is the number unemployed in that group expressed as a percentage of the labour force for that group. Estimates are percentages, rounded to the nearest tenth. Footnote 5 From 2001 to 2014, due to a slightly smaller sample size relative to other CMAs, the unemployment level and rate in Kelowna and Peterborough has more sampling variability, and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Footnote 1 To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality. How to cite: Statistics Canada.

Between the June and July reference weeks, many jurisdictions substantially eased public health restrictions affecting indoor and outdoor dining, recreation and cultural activities, retail shopping, and personal care services. All public health restrictions—aside from some masking and screening requirements in select settings—were lifted in Alberta (July 1) and Saskatchewan (July 11). British Columbia also lifted virtually all restrictions (July 1), although some capacity limits on certain activities remained. All regions of Quebec moved into the lowest level of restrictions (June 28), followed by a removal of retail capacity limits (July 12). In Ontario, personal care services partially resumed at the end of June, and the province reopened indoor dining and permitted recreational activities, with certain limitations, at the end of the LFS reference week (July 16). In Manitoba, personal care services and restaurants reopened at the end of June, and capacity limits on restaurants, gyms, and retail stores were further eased on July 17. Highlights Employment growth continues in July Employment rose by 94,000 (+0.5%) in July, adding to an increase of 231,000 (+1.2%) in June. The two consecutive months of growth brought employment to 246,000 (-1.3%) below the February 2020 level. Youth aged 15 to 24 and core-aged women aged 25 to 54 accounted for the bulk of the gains. All of the employment gains in July occurred in the private sector, where the number of employees rose by 123,000 (+1.0%). July employment gains were concentrated in full-time work (+83,000; +0.5%); the first increase since March 2021. The number of employees in the public sector fell by 31,000 (-0.7%) in July, the first decline since April 2020. The number of employed people who worked less than half their usual hours fell by 116,000 (-10.1%). Total hours worked were up 1.3% and were 2.7% below their pre-pandemic level. All of the employment gains were in the services-producing sector (+93,000). Employment increased in Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Unemployment trends downward The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 7.5% in July, lower than the recent peak of 9.4% in January 2021. Long-term unemployment was 244,000 higher than in February 2020 and accounted for more than one-quarter (27.8%) of total unemployment in July. Unemployment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 54,000. Among Canadians aged 55 and older, unemployment fell 22,000 (-5.9%). Unemployment for the core-aged population aged 25 to 54 was little changed. The labour underutilization rate declined 1.2 percentage points to 14.4%. July employment gains concentrated in the services-producing sector Employment rose by 35,000 in accommodation and food services. Employment was virtually unchanged in information, culture and recreation, and in retail trade. Following losses in May and June, the number of people who worked in goods-producing industries was little changed in July. The number of people who worked in the manufacturing industry in Ontario increased by 26,000, which fully erased the employment losses recorded in the spring. Employment growth continues in July Employment rose by 94,000 (+0.5%) in July, adding to the 231,000 (+1.2%) increase in June. The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 7.5%. Employment growth in July was almost entirely in Ontario. Youth aged 15 to 24 and core-aged women aged 25 to 54 accounted for the bulk of gains in the month. The two consecutive months of growth brought employment to 246,000 (-1.3%) below the February 2020 level. The employment rate was 60.3% in July, 1.5 percentage points below the pre-pandemic rate. The number of employed people who worked less than half their usual hours fell by 116,000 (-10.1%) in July. Total hours worked were up 1.3% and were 2.7% below their pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Employment rebounds in June and July as public health restrictions ease Private sector employees drive employment growth in July while self-employment remains flat All of the employment gains in July occurred in the private sector, where the number of employees rose by 123,000 (+1.0%), mostly in the accommodation and food services industry. This increase, combined with gains of 251,000 (+2.1%) in June, brought the number of private sector employees to within 1.5% (-191,000) of its February 2020 level. Self-employment was little changed in July and was down 7.1% (-205,000) compared with February 2020. The number of self-employed workers has seen virtually no growth since the onset of the pandemic. The pandemic-related declines have resulted in a small shift in the distribution of the self-employed across industries. Compared with July 2019, the proportion of self-employed workers who worked in accommodation and food services was down 1.0 percentage point to 2.6% (not seasonally adjusted), while the share of those who worked in health care and social assistance increased by 1.7 percentage points to 12.5%. The professional, scientific and technical services industry continued to account for the largest share of self-employed workers (16.9%). The number of employees in the public sector fell by 31,000 (-0.7%) in July, the first decline since April 2020. Nearly half of the monthly decrease was in Quebec (-15,000; -1.5%) and was partly due to a larger-than-usual summer decrease in the number of educational services workers. Despite this decline, public sector employment at the national level was up 150,000 (+3.8%) compared with February 2020. Chart 2 Growth in private sector employees while self-employment is unchanged July employment gains concentrated in full-time work July employment gains were concentrated in full-time work, which rose by 83,000 (+0.5%). The increase in full-time work was the first since March 2021 and was widespread across industries. Part-time employment held steady in July. The overall level of part-time employment was essentially the same as in February 2020, while full-time work was down 1.6% (-253,000). Of all those who worked part-time in July, one in four (25.6%) would have preferred full-time work (30 hours or more per week). In comparison, the involuntary part-time rate averaged 30.3% in the month of July, over the period of 2010 to 2019. For workers, an inability to find full-time work may have a number of consequences, including financial pressures and delays in accumulating employment experience. The share of Canadians working from home falls to its lowest level since October 2020 Among workers who worked at least half their usual hours, the proportion working from home fell 2.0 percentage points to 25.8% in July, returning to the pandemic lows recorded in the fall of 2020. For about half of those who worked from home (51.6%), doing so continues to represent a temporary adaptation to the pandemic. The information, culture and recreation industry saw one of the largest shifts in work location in July, with the proportion of those who worked from home falling 9.0 percentage points to 38.6%. In addition to employment gains or losses, and changes in work location, the number of people working at different locations may be affected by absences, which are typically higher during the summer when workers are more likely to be on vacation. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, working from home has been a key part of public health efforts to reduce infections, with some workers being more able to take advantage of this adaptation than others. A new study, Working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that workers with a bachelor's degree or higher were much more likely to work from home during the pandemic than those without postsecondary education. This continued in July, as workers with a degree remained about three times more likely to be working from home (45.6% vs. 15.7%). Chart 3 Proportion of Canadians working from home returns to level last seen in fall 2020 Largest employment gains among youth and core-aged women Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 increased by 62,000 (+2.5%) in July, with gains split between young men (+36,000; +2.8%) and young women (+26,000; +2.2%). All of the gains for youth were in part-time employment (+63,000; +5.1%). With the July gains, employment for young men returned to its February 2020 level, as a higher level of part-time work (+25,000; +4.6%) offset the decline in full-time work (-43,000;-5.5%). Among young women, part-time work was on par with pre-pandemic levels, while full-time work was down by 34,000 (-6.1%). Employment rose 30,000 (+0.5%) for core-aged women aged 25 to 54 in July, with full-time gains (+73,000; +1.5%) more than compensating for part-time losses (-44,000; -4.2%). Overall, employment was little changed for core-aged men. Core-aged employment was 124,000 (-1.0%) below pre-COVID levels in July, with similar deficits for men (-71,000; -1.1%) and women (-53,000; -0.9%). The employment rate for core-aged mothers whose youngest child was under 18 (74.7%) was 1.2 percentage points lower than in July 2019; whereas the rate for women in this age group without children under 18 (79.7%) was little changed from two years earlier (not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the employment rate was closer to its pre-COVID level for core-aged fathers (91.4%; down 0.9 percentage points) than for non-fathers (82.3%; down 1.6 percentage points) (not seasonally adjusted). Employment among women aged 55 and older fell 20,000 (-1.1%) in July, essentially wiping out June gains and leaving employment for this group 55,000 (-2.9%) below its February 2020 level. Conversely, employment among men in this age group held steady in July and has been little changed since returning to its pre-COVID level in March 2021. Compared with February 2020, the employment rate, which is a reflection of both employment and population size, was down 1.3 percentage points for men aged 55 and older in July, and by 1.7 percentage points for women of the same age group. Teenage students see employment recovery while older students lose ground During the summer months, the Labour Force Survey captures labour market information for youth who were full-time students in March and intended to return to school in September. This information helps to shed light on the experiences of students seeking to develop work experience and to fund their education. July is a particularly important month for student employment, as many high school students enter the labour market in June when school is over, and youth employment opportunities expand in child care and recreation activities for younger school-aged children. In July 2021, the employment rate for returning students aged 15 to 19 was 50.6%; up 2.3 percentage points from the 2015-to-2019 July average and 8.3 percentage points higher than in July 2020. In contrast, the employment rate for returning students aged 20 to 24 (66.2%) was 4.6 percentage points lower than the historical July average, after having returned to average levels in June. LFS results for August will provide an indication of how the entire May-to-August summer job market compares with that of previous years. Year-over-year increase in the employment rate nearly three times as large among visible minority Canadians July 2021 marks one year since Statistics Canada first started collecting data on the labour market situation of population groups designated as visible minorities through the LFS. Year-over-year comparisons of labour market indicators provide new insights on how diverse groups of Canadians have fared since July 2020, a point in time when the unequal impacts of the pandemic first became apparent, as well as the longer-term differences in labour market circumstances between population groups. The employment rate—the proportion of the population aged 15 and older that is employed—provides key information on the extent to which employment has recovered relative to the size of different diverse groups. From July 2020 to July 2021, employment rate increases were recorded for five of the seven largest population groups designated as visible minorities (not seasonally adjusted), led by South Asian (+11.0 percentage points to 73.5%), Black (+8.9 to 75.4%) and Latin American Canadians (+8.4 to 73.8%). Overall, the year-over-year increase in the employment rate was nearly three times as large among visible minority Canadians (+7.3 percentage points to 70.3%, not seasonally adjusted) than among their counterparts who are not Indigenous or a visible minority (+2.6 percentage points to 70.8%). Employment rate for very recent immigrants continues to climb The employment rate for very recent immigrants (in Canada for five years or less) continued its upward trend in July, reaching 69.1%, or 5.3 percentage points higher than in July 2019 (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). This trend has been strongly influenced by a drop in the number of newcomers to Canada since February 2020, a direct result of COVID-19 travel restrictions. Among immigrants who have been in Canada for more than five years, the employment rate was 58.1% in July, down 2.2 percentage points compared with July 2019. For those born in Canada, the employment rate was 61.0%, down 2.5 percentage points from its pre-COVID level (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). Employment rate for Indigenous men remains at pre-pandemic level In July, the employment rate among Indigenous men was 60.4%, little changed from July 2019. In comparison, the rate among non-Indigenous men was 65.3%, 1.9 percentage points lower than before the pandemic. The employment rate for Indigenous women (53.6%) was 2.0 percentage points lower than its pre-pandemic level, while among non-Indigenous women, the rate (56.4%) was 2.2 percentage points lower (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). LFS information for Indigenous people reflects the experience of those who identify as First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, and who live off reserve in the provinces. Unemployment trends downward The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 7.5% in July, considerably lower than the recent peak of 9.4% in January 2021. Prior to the COVID pandemic, the unemployment rate reached a historic low of 5.4% in May 2019, and was 5.7% in February 2020. The adjusted unemployment rate—which includes those who wanted a job but did not look for one—was 9.5% in July, down 0.6 percentage points from one month earlier. Chart 4 Unemployment continues downward trend following pandemic-related spikes Long-term unemployment remains elevated despite decline in July The total number of unemployed fell by 70,000 (-4.4%) in July, including a drop of 54,000 (-11.3%) among those who had been out of work for 27 weeks or more. Long-term unemployment was 244,000 (+135.9%) higher than in February 2020 and accounted for more than one-quarter (27.8%) of total unemployment in July. The number of people unemployed for a year or more accounted for more than two-thirds (68.8%) of the long-term unemployed, the highest proportion on record since comparable data became available in 1976. Unemployment falls among youngest and oldest workers Unemployment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 54,000 in July, with similar declines for young men (-25,000; -11.7%) and young women (-29,000; -16.5%). Among young men, the unemployment rate was down 1.8 percentage points to 12.6%, essentially returning to its February 2020 rate. The unemployment rate for young women (10.6%) was lower than the rate for young men, but was 1.6 percentage points above its pre-COVID level. Among Canadians aged 55 and older, unemployment fell 22,000 (-5.9%) in July, with the decline occurring primarily among older women on temporary layoff. The unemployment rate for older women (7.9%) was 2.9 percentage points higher than in February 2020. The pattern was similar for men of the same age, with the unemployment rate sitting at 7.8%, 2.5 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. Unemployment for the core-aged population aged 25 to 54 was little changed from June. The unemployment rates for men (6.8%) and women (6.0%) in this age group were higher than in February 2020 (2.0 percentage points higher for men and 1.3 percentage points higher for women). Unemployment rate falls among South Asian Canadians After falling in June, the overall unemployment rate among 15- to 69-year-olds who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities held steady in July at 10.2%. A notable decline was recorded in the South Asian population (-4.1 percentage points to 8.1%, not seasonally adjusted). Nearly half of the South Asian population (44.4%) lives in the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), where employment increased considerably in July. In contrast, the unemployment rate increased among Filipino (+3.1 percentage points to 10.1%) and Chinese Canadians (+1.6 percentage points to 11.8%). The unemployment rate also rose among people who were not Indigenous or a visible minority (+0.4 percentage points to 6.5%, not seasonally adjusted). Among youth, the unemployment rate fell 1.3 percentage points to 10.9% nationally for non-visible minority Canadians (not seasonally adjusted), but was little changed for population groups designated as visible minorities overall (17.1%). Compared with a year earlier, the unemployment rate among population groups designated as visible minorities was down 6.1 percentage points in July 2021, while it was 2.8 percentage points lower among non-visible minority Canadians (not seasonally adjusted). Labour market underutilization at lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic The labour underutilization rate—which complements the unemployment rate by capturing a broader range of people who are available and want to work but did not search for work, as well as those who worked less than half their usual hours—declined 1.2 percentage points to 14.4% in July. Most components of the underutilization rate dropped, led by the number of people who were employed but who worked less than half their usual hours (-116,000; -10.1%); the number of people who were on temporary layoff (-93,000; -45.3%); and the number people who were not in the labour force but wanted to work (-65,000; -12.5%). Despite these decreases, most components of the underutilization rate remained higher than before the pandemic. Compared with February 2020, there were more people who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours (+225,000; +27.7%); more job searchers (+369,000; +35.5%); and more people who wanted a job but did not look for one (+55,000; +14.0%). In contrast, the number of people on temporary layoff was virtually the same as it was pre-pandemic for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Infographic 1 Labour underutilization at lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic Participation in the labour force reaches pre-pandemic level for most groups The total labour force is the sum of the employed and the unemployed. The labour force participation rate—the labour force as a proportion of the population aged 15 and older—is an indicator of the balance between the number people who are working or looking for work, and the number of people who are pursuing other activities, including studying, caring for family members and pursuing leisure or voluntary activities. After dipping in April and May and rebounding in June, both the total labour force and the labour force participation rate held steady in July. The participation rate, at 65.2%, was 0.3 percentage points below February 2020. Youth labour force participation was little changed in July, and the participation rates of both young women (64.5%) and young men (64.6%) were on par with pre-COVID levels. The labour force participation rate among core-aged women rose 0.5 percentage points in July to 83.7%, while the rate was unchanged among core-aged men (91.5%). The rate for men was 0.5 percentage points higher than in February 2020, while for women it was little changed from its pre-pandemic level. Labour force participation among those aged 55 and older fell 0.3 percentage points in July, with all of the decline occurring among older women (down 0.6 percentage points to 31.7%). While the participation rate for older men has been stable since essentially returning to its pre-pandemic level in May, the rate for older women was 0.8 percentage points lower in July than in February 2020, after having essentially returned to its pre-pandemic level in June. July employment gains concentrated in the services-producing sector All of the employment gains in July were in the services-producing sector (+93,000), with increases recorded in the accommodation and food services (+35,000), and finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (+15,000) industries. Following losses in May and June, the number of people who worked in goods-producing industries was little changed in July. Chart 5 Employment in accommodation and food services furthest below its pre-COVID level More people working in accommodation and food services Employment rose by 35,000 in accommodation and food services in July, building on a notable gain of 101,000 in June. Most of the monthly increase was attributable to Ontario and Manitoba. Restaurants in Ontario began to welcome back customers for indoor dining at the end of the LFS reference week. While there were more people working in the industry in July 2021 than in July 2020, employment in accommodation and food services was 18.7% (-228,000) below its February 2020 level in July 2021. Among industries where employment had not yet returned to pre-COVID levels, accommodation and food services accounted for over one-third (36.3%) of the overall difference between current and February 2020 employment. Food and beverage servers working in the industry continue to be disproportionately impacted. In July 2021, employment in this occupational group was 109,000 (-37.7%) below the level recorded in July 2019, and little changed compared with July 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Employment rises in finance, insurance and real estate following two months of little change In July 2021, the number of people who worked in the finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing industry increased for the first time since April, rising 15,000 (+1.1%). Employment in the industry first surpassed its pre-COVID level in November 2020, and was 5.3% (+66,000) above its pre-COVID level in July 2021. Throughout the pandemic, many workers in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing have adapted to public health restrictions by working from home. Among 15- to 69-year-olds who worked at least half their usual hours, the industry had the second-highest proportion of workers working from home in July (58.6%, not seasonally adjusted). Little growth in retail trade, and information, culture and recreation Employment was virtually unchanged in the hard-hit information, culture and recreation industry. The recovery in this industry continues to be constrained by travel restrictions and limitations on the size of public gatherings. In July, employment in the industry was 8.7% (-68,000) lower than the level recorded before the pandemic in February 2020. The number of people who worked in retail trade was also little changed in July, and remained 2.7% (-61,000) below its pre-COVID level. While public health restrictions affecting the industry have been eased across the country, retail stores in many provinces still faced some degree of capacity limitations through late June or early July. According to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, total job vacancies in retail trade held steady from March to May 2021 (not seasonally adjusted). Ontario manufacturing employment recoups spring losses While employment was little changed in the goods-producing sector overall in July, a notable increase was recorded in Ontario (+20,000), largely as a result of gains in manufacturing. The number of people who worked in the manufacturing industry in Ontario increased by 26,000, which fully erased employment losses recorded in the spring. This monthly gain in Ontario was offset by losses in Quebec (-11,000) and British Columbia (-11,000). Nationally, the number of people who worked in manufacturing in July was similar to its pre-COVID level. Employment up in four provinces Employment increased in four provinces in July, with Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island seeing gains. Saskatchewan was the only province where employment dropped. For the second consecutive month, British Columbia was the lone province with employment above its pre-pandemic level. Compared with February 2020, the employment gap was largest in Saskatchewan (-3.6%), Prince Edward Island (-3.5%), New Brunswick (-2.5%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (-2.2%). For further information on key province and industry-level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" After dropping in April and May and increasing in June, employment in Ontario rose by 72,000 (+1.0%) in July, including an increase of 49,000 (+1.5%) in the Toronto census metropolitan area. While manufacturing led the provincial employment increase, accommodation and food services and wholesale and retail trade also saw gains, as the province's reopening plan allowed restaurants to resume indoor dining and retail stores to remove capacity limits. The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 8.0%. In Manitoba, employment increased by 7,400 (+1.1%) in July, and the unemployment rate dropped 1.5 percentage points to 6.1%. Gains were predominantly in accommodation and food services, and information, culture and recreation. Employment in Nova Scotia increased by 3,700 (+0.8%) in July, and the unemployment rate dropped 0.6 percentage points to 8.4%. All of the gains were in full-time work and were mostly in health care and social assistance. Prince Edward Island saw employment rise by 1,100 (+1.4%) in July, following a decline of similar magnitude the previous month. The unemployment rate fell 2.9 percentage points to 9.6%. In Saskatchewan, employment declined (-4,500; -0.8%) for the second consecutive month, while the unemployment rate was little changed at 7.0%. Decreases in wholesale and retail trade accounted for nearly half (45.5%) of the cumulative two-month employment decline. Labour market churn remains below pre-COVID baseline As the easing of COVID-19 public health restrictions continues, employers face a number of challenges in resuming full business activities. At the same time, workers face their own challenges, whether they are returning to their previous industries and occupations, or entering new fields. During this period of adjustment between labour supply and demand, supplementary measures of labour market churn—the number of people changing employment status or changing jobs—are important complements to concepts such as employment, unemployment and job vacancies. For example, some aspects of churn, such as voluntary job changes, can be an indicator of whether workers feel confident in seeking new employment. Beyond the overall net changes in the number of people who are employed, unemployed, or not in the labour force, the Labour Force Survey tracks two particular groups of workers who flow out of employment and remain jobless in the LFS reference week: those who lost a job in the past 12 months and those who left a job in the past 12 months. These indicators are part of the baseline level of churn in the labour market. At the height of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, the number of core-aged people (aged 25 to 54) who lost a job due to permanent or temporary layoff in the previous 12 months was at a record high 2.0 million in April 2020. Since then, the number has gradually returned to levels consistent with the pre-pandemic baseline, and in July 2021 stood at 555,000 (not seasonally adjusted). While the number of people who lost a job spiked as a result of COVID-19, the number of job leavers—people who left a job voluntarily in the previous 12 months and remained not employed in the LFS reference week—trended down throughout 2020 and 2021, reaching a record low of 217,000 in April 2021. Since then, the number of job leavers has increased in parallel with improving labour market conditions, but has remained substantially below pre-COVID levels. In July, there were 257,000 core-aged job leavers, down 28.3% (-101,000) compared with July 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). In addition to flows into and out of employment, labour market churn includes workers who remain employed from one month to the next but who change jobs. The job-changing rate was 0.6% in July 2021. In other words, of people who were employed in both June and July, fewer than one in 160 (0.6%) changed jobs between the two months. After dropping to close to zero in May 2020, the job changing rate has gradually increased over the past year but has remained below the 2019 average of 0.7%. Among employees who change jobs from one month to another, a certain proportion earn higher wages in their new job. Indeed, seeking higher income may be a key factor in the decision to change jobs. In July, 53.9% of job changers earned a higher wage in their new job, compared with an average of 49.5% in 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). Taken together, these various indicators of churn suggest that the labour market is not yet providing the conditions necessary to fully encourage the typical level of voluntary job turnover among workers. Chart 6 Job-changing rate approaching pre-COVID level Wage growth strongly influenced by changes in the composition of employment Wage growth is another important indicator of labour market conditions. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, year-over-year growth in average hourly wages of all employees averaged 3.5% in 2019. Since then, year-over-year wage growth has varied widely, from +10.9% in April 2020 to -1.8% in April 2021. These large changes have been the result of several factors, including large COVID-related shifts in some of the employment characteristics most closely associated with wage levels. For example, among the five occupational groups with the lowest average hourly wages in 2019, the number of employees dropped sharply (-430,000; -14.3%) between July 2019 and July 2020 and then partially recovered (+237,000; +9.2%) by July 2021. In contrast, the number of employees in the five highest-paid occupations was little changed from July 2019 to July 2020 and increased by 116,000 (+6.4%) in the past 12 months (not seasonally adjusted). Similarly, the large employment losses and gains resulting from COVID-19 have contributed to shifts in the balance between people who have been with their employer for a shorter time, and who are generally lower-paid, and people with more years of tenure. The proportion of employees who had been in their current job for 6 months or less was 13.2% in July 2021, up 3.6 percentage points compared with one year earlier and similar to July 2019 (13.6%) (not seasonally adjusted). Various methods exist to provide a clearer picture of wage trends by removing the effects of changes in the composition of employment. One such method—a fixed-weighted average wage, which holds the distribution of employees across occupations and job tenures constant at the 2019 average—shows that pandemic-related changes in the distribution of employees across occupations and job tenure continue to impact indicators of wage growth. At the onset of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, when there was a sudden reduction in the number of lower-wage and lower-tenure employees, average hourly wages were 10.3% (+$2.87) higher in April 2020 than the 2019 average. Using a fixed-weighted wage level to control for compositional change, this increase is reduced to less than half (+4.9%; +$1.33). Since that time, the difference between the actual and the fixed-weighted average wage has narrowed. Nonetheless, in July 2021, the actual average hourly wage was $1.84 (+6.6%) higher than the 2019 average, whereas the fixed-weighted average wage was $1.44 (+5.2%) higher, demonstrating that accounting for changes in the composition of employment across occupation and job tenures remains important for understanding wage growth in the current context. Chart 7 Changes to labour market composition impact wage trends Looking ahead: immigration and Canada's labour market Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the key issues facing the Canadian labour market was whether the impact of population aging, which was putting downward pressure on labour force growth, could be mitigated through increased immigration and higher participation among groups typically under-represented in the labour market. From 2016, the number of very recent immigrants (those who arrived within the previous five years) who were participating in the labour force increased notably, and reached 752,000 in 2019. In 2020, the growth of this group stalled as a result of the number of newcomers entering Canada falling to a record low due to COVID-related travel restrictions. So far in 2021, the number of very recent immigrants participating in the labour force has returned to 2019 levels, averaging 749,000—3.7% of the total labour force—in the seven months from January to July. Chart 8 Number of very recent immigrants in Canada's labour force stalls during COVID As travel restrictions begin to ease, LFS results in the coming months will shed light on whether the number of new immigrants participating in Canada's labour market will continue to grow.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for July are for the week of July 11 to 17. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). Since March 2020, all LFS face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both respondents and interviewers. While this has resulted in a decline in the LFS response rate, more than 40,000 interviews were completed in July and in-depth data quality evaluations conducted each month confirm that the Labour Force Survey continues to produce an accurate portrait of Canada's labour market. The suspension of face-to-face interviewing has had a larger impact on response rates in Nunavut than in other jurisdictions. Due to the larger decline in response rates for Nunavut, and resulting changes in the composition of the responding sample, data for Nunavut (table 14-10-0292) should be used with caution. To reduce the risks associated with declining data quality for Nunavut, users are advised to use 12-month averages (available upon request) rather than 3-month averages when possible. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the quality of LFS data for Nunavut each month and provide users with updated guidelines as required. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. The distribution of LFS interviews in July 2021 compared with June 2021, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • June 2021: 64.2% • July 2021: 63.6% Online interviews • June 2021: 35.8% • July 2021: 36.4% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. The five occupation groups with the lowest average hourly wages in 2019: sales support occupations; service support and other service occupations, n.e.c.; service supervisors and specialized service occupations; labourers in processing, manufacturing and utilities; and service representatives and other customer and personal services occupations. The five occupation groups with the highest average hourly wages in 2019: professional occupations in natural and applied sciences; occupations in front-line public protection services; middle management occupations in trades, transportation, production and utilities; specialized middle management occupations; senior management occupations. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in July 2021 analysis Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business,' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Information on population groups Since July 2020, the LFS has included a question asking respondents to report the population group(s) to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2021 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, people who identify as a member of a population group (visible minority) are analyzed separately.

From April 2020 to June 2021, 30% of employees aged 15 to 64 who worked during the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reference week had performed most of their hours from home. In contrast, about 4% of employees did so in 2016. These unprecedented changes in the proportion of Canadians working from home raise several questions for employees and employers regarding the work arrangements that should prevail once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. For employers, the optimal amount of telework will likely depend on many factors, including the degree to which working from home affects productivity and worker turnover, facilitates the hiring of employees living far from the workplace, fosters or inhibits teamwork, makes training more or less difficult, and affects employees' sense of belonging. These factors are likely to impact the types of investments that businesses will make in the near future to improve employee training, office design, and the security and performance of their telework systems. In contrast, workers' preferences for telework will likely depend on how much working from home will lower their commuting expenses, affect their ability to perform most of their tasks, reduce their social interactions, and facilitate or hinder work–life balance. For the first time, the February 2021 Labour Force Survey measured the preferences of Canadian employees regarding working from home in a post-COVID-19 context. For more information on workers' preferences for telework, see the study titled ""Working from home: Productivity and preferences."" To inform discussions on these issues, today Statistics Canada sketches a detailed profile of workers and families who worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021. High-income families were more likely to work from home Canadians have worked from home to varying degrees since April 2020. From April 2020 to June 2021, 45% of dual-earner salaried couples in the top 10% of the earnings distribution had both spouses working from home. This was nine times the rate of 5% observed for their counterparts in the bottom 10% of the earnings distribution. The greater propensity of high-income families to work from home largely reflects the fact that these couples generally hold jobs that are more amenable to telework than lower-income couples. For example, in 57% of dual-earner salaried couples in the top 10% of the earnings distribution, both spouses held jobs that could in principle be done from home. For dual-earner salaried couples in the bottom 10% of the earnings distribution, the rate was 11%. Chart 1 Percentage of dual-earner salaried couples where both spouses worked from home, April 2020 to June 2021, by weekly earnings decile Roughly 7 in 10 workers in finance and insurance, as well as in professional, scientific and technical services, worked from home As expected, the propensity to work from home varied substantially across industries. Roughly 7 in 10 individuals in the finance and insurance and professional, scientific and technical services sectors worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021. At the other end of the spectrum, 5% of workers in accommodation and food services performed their jobs from home during that period. Working from home was also fairly frequent in information and cultural industries (65%) and public administration (56%). In many industries, employees in large firms—those with 500 employees or more—were more likely to work from home than those in small firms (those with fewer than 20 employees). For example, 80% of employees of large firms in professional, scientific and technical services worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021. In contrast, 54% of their counterparts employed in small firms worked from home during that period. In the private sector, 36% of employees of large firms worked from home, twice the rate of 18% observed for those working in small firms. The large differences observed across industries and firm sizes from April 2020 to June 2021 suggest that employers' preferences for telework in a post-COVID-19 context might differ along these two dimensions. The propensity to work from home varied substantially across regions and provinces Partly because of regional differences in industrial structure, the degree to which Canadians worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021 differed substantially across regions and provinces. Of all Ontario workers—employees and self-employed—aged 15 to 64 who were working during the LFS reference week, 37% worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021. The corresponding percentage for Quebec workers was 30%. In contrast, between 17% and 23% of workers in the Atlantic provinces worked from home during that period. In Saskatchewan, 20% did so. These differences have potential implications for public transit. They likely explain—at least in part—why the number of passenger trips in urban transit systems fell more in Quebec and Ontario than it did in the Atlantic provinces since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 2020 to April 2021, the number of passenger trips in urban transit systems dropped by 72% in Quebec and Ontario combined, compared with 48% in the Atlantic provinces (Statistics Canada Table 23-10-0251-01). For more information on the relationship between working from home and public transit, see the study titled ""Working from home: Potential implications for public transit and greenhouse gas emissions."" Larger differences in the propensity to work from home were observed across economic regions, with large regions generally displaying higher rates of telework than small towns or communities. Ottawa had the highest rate of people working from home, with close to half (47%) of all workers—many of whom are employed in the federal public administration—performing their tasks from home from April 2020 to June 2021. In contrast, at most 12% of workers did so in smaller regions such as Cape Breton, Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine, South Coast–Burin Peninsula and Notre Dame–Central Bonavista Bay. In Outaouais, Montréal and Toronto, between 41% and 44% of workers worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021. Virtually all self-employed workers who could work from home did so Working from home was more frequent among self-employed workers than among employees. Of all self-employed workers aged 15 to 64 who were working during the LFS reference week, 38% worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021. Since 39% of them held jobs that could actually be done from home, these numbers indicate that virtually all self-employed workers who could work from home did so. This was not the case for employees. While 43% of them held jobs that could be done from home, 30% worked most of their hours from home from April 2020 to June 2021. Overall, 31% of all workers—employees and self-employed—worked from home during that period. The propensity to work from home increased with educational attainment, in line with the fact that highly educated workers hold jobs that are more conducive to telework, compared with less educated workers. For example, 58% of workers who have more than a bachelor's degree performed most of their hours from home, compared with 7% of workers with no high school diploma. Likewise, highly paid employees were more likely than other employees to work from home. For instance, 63% of employees in the top 10% of the hourly wage distribution worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021, almost eight times the rate of 8% observed for their counterparts in the bottom 10% of the distribution. Chart 2 Percentage of workers who worked from home, by education level, April 2020 to June 2021 Men and young workers were less likely to work from home Partly because they are overrepresented in retail trade as well as accommodation and food services—two sectors where working from home is rarely feasible—workers aged 15 to 24 were at least half as likely to work from home than older workers. To illustrate, 16% of women aged 15 to 24 worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021, compared with 36% of women aged 45 to 54. The corresponding percentages were 12% for men aged 15 to 24 and 28% for those aged 45 to 54. Regardless of marital status and whether they had children or not, men worked from home to a lesser extent than women. For example, 30% of married men with children worked from home from April 2020 to June 2021, compared with 39% for their female counterparts. Overall, 27% of men worked from home, while 35% of women did so. The propensity to work from home varied across population groups In July 2020, the Labour Force Survey started collecting data on Canada's population groups. These data help to improve our understanding of the degree to which Canadians worked from home during the pandemic. From July 2020 to June 2021, the degree to which Canadian workers worked from home varied across population groups. Partly because they are overrepresented in finance and insurance and in professional, scientific and technical services—two sectors where the vast majority of jobs can be done home—a relatively high proportion (43%) of men of Chinese origin worked from home during that period. This was almost three times the rate of 15% observed among men of Filipino origin. Furthermore, 37% of men of South Asian origin and 27% of Black men worked from home from July 2020 to June 2021. Similar differences were observed among women. The propensity to work from home was substantially higher among women of Chinese origin (49%), South Asian origin (36%) and Black women (33%) than among Filipino women (19%). Overall, 29% of Canadians worked from home from July 2020 to June 2021. Table 1 Percentage of workers working from home, by selected characteristics, April 2020 to June 2021 Table 2 Percentage of workers working from home, by economic region, April 2020 to June 2021 Note to readers The data in this release are from the April 2020 to June 2021 cycles of the Labour Force Survey and reflect averages observed during this period in the 10 Canadian provinces. Worker-level results are based on a sample comprising individuals aged 15 to 64 who were employed and were working (i.e., who were not absent) during the LFS reference week. Unless otherwise noted, both self-employed workers and employees are included in the estimates. In all cases, full-time students, full-time members of the Armed Forces and legislators are excluded. Results for dual-earner salaried couples are based on a sample comprising husband-wife couples (married or living common-law) in which both spouses are aged 18 to 64 and are employees working during the LFS reference week. Couples in which at least one spouse is a full-time student, a full-time member of the Armed Forces or a legislator are excluded. Jobs that in principle can be done from home are identified using the methodology outlined in Deng, Morissette and Messacar (2020). In this release, the term ""worked from home"" refers to workers who worked most of their hours from home during the LFS reference week. The term ""married"" refers to individuals who are married or in a common-law relationship.

Seven provinces contributed to the gain, led by Ontario, which jumped 22.7%. Construction intentions in the residential sector were up 9.1%, while the non-residential sector advanced 2.2%. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits increased 5.2% to $7.2 billion. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, June 2021 Ontario residential permits bounce back High-value permits for new apartment buildings in the census metropolitan areas (CMA) of Toronto and Hamilton helped push multi-family permits up 13.5% to $3.7 billion nationally in June. Provincially, Ontario led the way, rebounding 67.8% to $1.8 billion. On the other hand, Quebec reported the largest decrease (-29.9%), pulling back from a record high in May. Construction intentions for single-family dwellings increased 4.7% to $3.4 billion. Seven provinces saw gains in this component, led by Ontario and Alberta. Overall, the value of residential building permits increased 9.1% to $7.2 billion, following two months of lower construction intentions. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Non-residential permits up slightly Construction intentions for the non-residential sector were up 2.2% to $3.1 billion in June. Gains were reported in eight provinces, led by Alberta (+32.7%). The value of commercial permits rose 7.4% to $1.7 billion. High-value permits, such as the Agri-food Hub and Trade Centre in the city of Lethbridge and an office building in the city of Vaughan, helped Alberta (+54.8%) and Ontario (+16.2%) to lead this component. Newfoundland and Labrador, down 92.5%, returned to more typical levels following a strong May. Industrial permits increased 2.3% to $526 million. Six provinces showed increases, led by Ontario (+37.8%), while Quebec reported the largest decrease (-32.9%). The institutional component was down in June, falling 6.7% to $871 million, as Ontario's notable decrease (-37.7%) drew down the national level. Meanwhile, Quebec surged 38.4% to $359 million, as several permits issued for alternative care and senior citizen residences coincided with an initiative from the government of Quebec to increase the number of beds. Residential permits pull down second-quarter intentions Total building permits declined 1.7% to $31.0 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared with the previous period. Despite this, the value of building permits remained the second highest on record and was 38.5% above the same quarter in 2020, which was heavily impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in the construction industry. The value of permits for the residential sector fell 4.2% to $21.4 billion in the second quarter. Permits for both multi-family and single-family dwellings dropped, with seven provinces reporting decreases. Construction intentions in the non-residential sector rose 4.5% to $9.6 billion. Although second-quarter values exceeded the values in the first quarter of 2020, non-residential permits remained below the quarterly levels of 2019. Among the non-residential components, institutional permits increased for a fourth consecutive quarter, boosted by large projects in the education and health care sectors.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates are available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (e.g., single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (e.g., apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for July will be released on September 2.

Real gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 0.3% in May, following a 0.5% decline in April, and total economic activity was approximately 2% below February 2020's pre-pandemic level.

Preliminary information indicates an approximate 0.7% increase in real GDP for June. Growth in retail trade and accommodation and food services were influenced by the easing of public health measures in many provinces in June. There were also gains in manufacturing and mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction, while construction and wholesale trade contracted. This advance estimate points to an approximate 0.6% increase in real GDP in the second quarter of 2021. Because of their preliminary nature, these estimates will be revised on August 31, with the release of the official GDP data for the June reference month and the second quarter of 2021. Construction is down Construction decreased 2.3% in May, after increasing in the previous five months. Chart 2 Construction declines in May Residential building construction contracted 4.2% in May, down for the first time since November 2020. Declines in single-family homes construction, and in alterations and improvements, more than offset increases in multi-unit dwellings construction. Repair construction decreased 3.7%, while engineering and other construction activities was up 0.1% in May. Non-residential building construction edged up 0.1%, as growths in commercial and institutional building construction were offset by lower industrial building and structure construction. Real estate and rental and leasing eases The real estate and rental and leasing sector contracted 0.4% in May, following a 0.8% decline in April. This is the first back-to-back decline in the sector since March-April 2020. The output of offices of real estate agents and brokers fell 7.2% in May, following a 10.7% drop in April, returning to output levels similar to July 2020. Home resale activity slowed in almost all Canadian urban centres. Retail trade continues to decline Retail trade declined 2.7%, following a 5.7% drop in April, as 9 of 12 subsectors contracted in May. Store closures, in-store capacity reduction, limited hours of operation and other public measures put in place to combat the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the country, continued to contribute towards lower retail activity. Building material and garden equipment and supplies (-9.5%), motor vehicle and parts dealers (-3.5%), clothing and clothing accessories (-7.6%) and other traditional brick-and-mortar stores that rely more on in-store traffic, contributed the most to the declines. Upticks at electronics and appliance stores (+1.3%) and food and beverage stores (+0.1%) mitigated some of the declines. Manufacturing declines The manufacturing sector contracted for the third time in four months, down 0.8% in May, as both durable and non-durable manufacturing declined. Non-durable manufacturing was down 0.9% as declines concentrated in food (-2.5%), chemical (-3.2%) and petroleum and coal product (-2.0%) manufacturing more than offset increases in the remaining six subsectors. Durable manufacturing decreased 0.8% in May, following a 1.9% decline in April, as six of ten subsectors were down. Contributing the most to the decline were fabricated metal product (-3.4%) and machinery (-2.6%) manufacturing; the latter subsector continued to be affected by a global microchip shortage. Non-metallic mineral product (-2.2%) and furniture and related product (-2.6%) manufacturing were also down, while transportation equipment (+1.0%), wood product (+1.2%), miscellaneous (+1.5%) and primary metal (+0.8%) manufacturing offset some of the declines. Mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction grows Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction grew for the third time in four months, up 2.0% in May, as all three subsectors increased. The oil and gas subsector increased for the third consecutive month, rising 2.6% in May, as all forms of activity were up in the month. Oil sands extraction rose 3.2% in May, as a number of facilities and sites ramped up production after some worksites in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo in Alberta experienced COVID-19 outbreaks and lowered or suspended production in April. Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) grew 1.8%, as both crude petroleum extraction and natural gas extraction were up. Support activities for mining, and oil and gas extraction grew 3.2% in May, as all types of services were up. Mining and quarrying (except oil and gas) rose 0.3% in May, growing for the sixth time in the last seven months. Metal ore mineral mining grew 0.9% as gold and silver mining increased and uranium mining activities restarted following pandemic-related closures at a number of sites. Coal mining increased 0.4% in May, while non-metallic mineral mining decreased 1.1%, primarily as a result of a decline in potash mining. The public sector increases The public sector (educational services, health care and social assistance, and public administration) advanced 0.7% in May, more than offsetting a 0.5% contraction in April. Educational services were up 2.0% in May. Elementary and secondary schools led the growth (+3.8%) as activity returned to normal levels following the Government of Ontario's decision to move the annual spring break from mid-March to mid-April. Health care and social assistance rose 0.6%, as most industries advanced. Public administration was essentially unchanged (0.0%) as decreases in municipal, provincial and territorial, and aboriginal public administration, were offset by a 0.8% increase in federal government public administration, as 2021 Census of Population and 2021 Census of Agriculture activities were underway. Other industries Finance and insurance increased 0.4% in May, up for the fourth time in the last five months. Financial investment services, funds and other financial vehicles rose 1.6%, and insurance carriers and related activities grew 0.7% following three monthly declines. Transportation and warehousing declined 1.4% in May. Lower rail (-5.4%), support activities (-1.7%), truck (-1.1%) and pipeline transportation (-1.5%) contributed the most to the decline. Professional, scientific and technical services rose 0.4% in May as the majority of services were up. Leading the increase were computer systems design and related services (+1.2%) and architectural, engineering and related services (+0.5%). Legal services (-0.9%), which derive much of their activity from real estate transactions, offset some of the gains. Accommodation and food services declined 2.4% in May, following a 4.3% decrease in April. Both accommodation services (-5.3%) and food services and drinking places (-1.3%) were down, affected by public health measures aimed at slowing the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilities were up 0.9%, as all subsectors grew in May, led by electric power generation, transmission and distribution, as well as natural gas distribution, both up 0.9%. Wholesale declined 0.6% in May, partly offsetting growth in the previous two months. Increases in machinery, equipment and supplies (+1.3%) and food, beverage and tobacco (+2.4%) were more than offset by lower building material and supplies (-4.5%), personal and households goods wholesaling (-1.8%). Chart 3 Main industrial sectors' contribution to the percentage change in gross domestic product Table 1 Monthly gross domestic product by industry at basic prices in chained (2012) dollars – Seasonally adjusted Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The release on gross domestic product by industry is an example of how Statistics Canada supports global sustainable development goal reporting. This release will be used to help measure the following goal: Note to readers Monthly data on gross domestic product (GDP) by industry at basic prices are chained volume estimates with 2012 as the reference year. This means that the data for each industry and each aggregate are obtained from a chained volume index multiplied by the industry's value added in 2012. The monthly data are benchmarked to annually chained Fisher volume indexes of GDP obtained from the constant-price supply and use tables (SUTs) up to the latest SUT year (2017). For the period starting in January 2018, data are derived by chaining a fixed-weight Laspeyres volume index to the prior period. The fixed weights are 2017 industry prices. This approach makes the monthly GDP by industry data more comparable with expenditure-based GDP data, which are chained quarterly. All data in this release are seasonally adjusted. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. An advance estimate of industrial production for June 2021 is available upon request. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Revisions With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions have been made back to January 2020. Each month, newly available administrative and survey data from various industries in the economy are integrated, resulting in statistical revisions. Updated and revised administrative data (including taxation statistics), new information provided by respondents to industry surveys, and standard changes to seasonal adjustment calculations are incorporated with each release. Real-time table Real-time table 36-10-0491-01 will be updated on August 16, 2021. Next release Data on GDP by industry for June 2021 will be released on August 31, 2021.

Inappropriate sexualized behaviours include inappropriate verbal or non-verbal communication, sexually explicit materials, and unwanted physical contact or suggested sexual relations. All workplaces in Canada must comply with anti-harassment and discrimination laws, and many employers have policies in place to address inappropriate sexualized behaviours in their workplaces—including procedures for reporting incidents to the appropriate people. Nevertheless, approximately one-third of women (32%) and one-quarter of men (26%) said that they had not received any information from their employer on how to report sexual harassment and sexual assault. Based on results from the 2020 Survey on Sexual Misconduct at Work, the Juristat article, ""Workers' experiences of inappropriate sexualized behaviours, sexual assault and gender-based discrimination in the Canadian provinces, 2020"" is released today. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how many Canadians work, with shifts to remote work or working in greater isolation. One consequence of these changes is the transformation in how workers interact with their colleagues and clients. The Survey on Sexual Misconduct at Work was conducted just prior to the onset of public health measures, including the closure of many workplaces. The results of this survey therefore reflect experiences of workers prior to the pandemic, when workplaces were fully open. One in ten women experience gender-based discrimination at work One in ten women (10%) personally experienced workplace discrimination based on gender, gender identity or sexual orientation in the year prior to the pandemic, compared with less than one in twenty men (4%). Women, young employees, those with disabilities or those belonging to the LGBTQ2+ community were most likely to experience inappropriate sexualized behaviours and discrimination based on gender, gender identity or sexual orientation at work. For example, almost half (47%) of LGBTQ2+ workers had personally experienced this kind of behaviour or discrimination, compared with just over one-fifth (22%) of non-LGBTQ2+ workers. Workers belonging to a visible minority population were less likely than non-visible minority workers to report having experienced gender-based discrimination at work. This was the case for visible minority women (8% of whom experienced gender-based discrimination, compared with 11% of non-visible minority women) and visible minority men (4%, versus 5%). Findings were similar for inappropriate sexualized behaviours at work: these were experienced by 19% of visible minority women and 11% of visible minority men, proportions that were smaller than among their non-visible minority counterparts (27% and 19%, respectively). Reports of inappropriate sexualized behaviours at work were as common among Indigenous women (25%) as they were among non-Indigenous women (25%), and proportions were similar between Indigenous men (20%) and non-Indigenous men (16%). Indigenous women were also as likely as non-Indigenous women to report having experienced gender-based discrimination at work (10% respectively). Inappropriate sexualized behaviour more common for women in occupations historically held by men For women, experiences of inappropriate sexualized behaviour were most common for those working in certain occupations where men have historically outnumbered women. For example, almost half (47%) of women working in trades, transportation, equipment operation and related occupations said that they experienced inappropriate sexualized behaviour at work in the year leading up to the pandemic―compared with 19% of men. Women and men in health, sales and service jobs experience high rates of inappropriate sexualized behaviours Women working in some occupations where they historically outnumbered men also experienced high rates of inappropriate sexualized behaviours in the year leading up the pandemic. For example, almost one in three women working in sales and service (32%) and health-related occupations (30%) said that they had been targeted with inappropriate sexualized behaviours at work in the previous year. By way of comparison, about one in five men in sales and service (22%) and health care (19%) occupations had personally experienced inappropriate behaviours in the previous year. Over half (53%) of women in sales and service occupations who had experienced these behaviours said that a customer or client had been responsible for at least one incident, compared with just over one-fifth of men (21%). Conversely, men who experienced these behaviours were much more likely to be targeted by a co-worker (83%) than women (64%). One in three women targeted with sexually explicit materials at work says someone in authority was responsible People with formal authority in the workplace―such as supervisors and bosses―were often the perpetrators of inappropriate sexualized behaviours in the year prior to the pandemic. For example, about three in ten women (28%) who were targeted with sexually explicit materials at work identified someone in authority as responsible, as did 30% of men who experienced unwanted physical contact or suggested sexual relations. In terms of gender-based discrimination in the workplace, 44% of women and 36% of men who had been targeted said that it had been perpetrated by someone in authority. Women most often identified a man as the perpetrator of all three types of inappropriate sexualized behaviour. While this was also true for men targeted with sexually explicit materials (66%), about half of men (51%) who experienced unwanted physical contact or suggested sexual relations said that the perpetrator was a woman. Many women do not speak out about their experiences for fear of negative impact on their career As with inappropriate sexualized behaviours and sexual assaults that happen in other contexts, not all instances that occurred in the workplace were reported to someone in authority. For example, about half of women (51%) who had experienced inappropriate communication in the workplace in the year prior to the pandemic discussed the incident with someone at work, and a supervisor or boss was that person in less than half of these instances (46%). A much smaller proportion of men (20%) chose to speak to someone about their experience, and of those who did, about four in ten (39%) brought it up to a supervisor or boss. One in five women (20%) who did not speak to someone about inappropriate communication that they experienced at work, stated that they feared negative consequences for their careers if they did so―a considerably higher proportion than among men (8%). Just over one-quarter of the women (26%) thought that no action would be taken if they reported inappropriate communication, and 12% stated that they were too embarrassed or ashamed to discuss what happened. Among men who did not report inappropriate communication, about one-quarter (26%) stated that they did not do so because they did not see the behaviour as inappropriate. Chart 1 Inappropriate sexualized or discriminatory behaviours personally experienced in the workplace in the past 12 months, by gender and types of behaviour, provinces, 2020 Chart 2 Workers who personally experienced inappropriate sexualized behaviour in a work-related setting in the previous 12 months, by occupation and gender, provinces, 2020 Note to readers The 2020 Survey on Sexual Misconduct at Work (SSMW) collected information on inappropriate sexualized behaviours, discrimination based on actual or perceived gender, gender identity and sexual orientation, and sexual assault that happened in a work-related setting. A work-related setting is defined as any place where a person performs work activities for their job or business, or interacts with people associated with their work (such as during work-related social events). This includes incidents that happened over the phone or online. The survey measured 15 individual inappropriate sexualized and discriminatory behaviours, which are grouped into four categories for the purposes of analysis: inappropriate verbal or non-verbal communication, sexually explicit materials, unwanted physical contact or suggested sexual relations, and discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender, gender identity or sexual orientation. The survey also measured three types of sexual assault: sexual attacks, unwanted sexual touching, and sexual activity to which a person is unable to consent, because they were coerced, manipulated, intoxicated or forced in another non-physical way. Individuals aged 15 years and older and living in the Canadian provinces were surveyed, while members of the Canadian Armed Forces, individuals residing in the territories, on reserve or in institutions were excluded. The terms ""women"" and ""men"" include both cisgender and transgender women and men. The development and collection of the SSMW and the analysis of its results was funded by Women and Gender Equality Canada. For information on the methodology of the survey, see: Survey on Sexual Misconduct at Work.

Beyond deaths attributed to the disease itself, the pandemic could also have indirect consequences that increase or decrease the number of deaths as a result of various factors, including delayed medical procedures, increased substance use, or declines in deaths attributable to other causes, such as influenza. To understand both the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, it is important to measure excess mortality, which occurs when there are more deaths than expected in a given period. It should be noted that, even without a pandemic, there is always some year-to-year variation in the number of people who die in a given week. This means that the number of expected deaths should fall within a certain range of values. There is evidence of excess mortality when weekly deaths are consistently higher than the expected number, but especially when they exceed the range of what is expected over several consecutive weeks. From March 2020 to mid-May 2021, there were an estimated 19,979 excess deaths in Canada, or 6.0% more deaths than what would be expected were there no pandemic, after accounting for changes in the population, such as aging. Over this same period, 23,050 deaths were directly attributed to COVID-19. Over the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada experienced significant overall excess mortality over two distinct periods: the first in the spring of 2020 (from the onset of the pandemic in March, to June 2020), and the second from the fall of 2020 to the winter of 2021 (from the end of September 2020 through to the end of January). These periods corresponded with elevated levels of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 itself. While COVID-19 deaths were still observed, nationally, no significant excess mortality has been observed in the provisional death data since February 2021. As part of Statistics Canada's commitment to providing timely and relevant information on COVID-19 and its impact on Canadians, a new updated provisional dataset from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database, covering the period from January 2020 to May 2021, was released today. Updates were also made to the provisional death estimates, which have been adjusted, where possible, to account for the incomplete nature of the counts. The provisional estimates will continue to be revised in future releases, as more information is reported by provincial and territorial vital statistics agencies, and as estimation methods continue to be enhanced. Excess mortality in the winter of 2021 does not correspond as closely to COVID-19 as in the spring of 2020 In the first months of the pandemic, from March to June 2020, 8,620 more lives were lost than expected. This is closely aligned with the 8,525 deaths caused by COVID-19 over the same period, which disproportionately affected Canadians older than 64 years of age, particularly in Quebec and Ontario. This period saw an average of 784 excess deaths per week. The number of excess deaths and the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 peaked in the last two weeks of April 2020. There were 2,738, or 25%, more deaths than expected in those two weeks, which is similar to the 2,725 deaths caused by COVID-19 during the same period. Through the summer of 2020, the overall number of deaths in Canada fell generally within the range of what would be expected had there been no pandemic. In the fall, the number of excess deaths and deaths attributable to COVID-19 started to rise again, and affected provinces saw relatively few COVID-19 deaths through the first months of the pandemic, notably Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. From the end of September 2020 to the end of January 2021, there were 10,278 deaths in Canada, which was 10% more deaths than expected. Over the same period, 9,540 lives were lost to COVID-19. While this second period of excess mortality was seven weeks longer than the first period (in the spring of 2020), the average number of excess deaths per week was lower, at 571. The peak of this period was also less pronounced, with the highest number of excess deaths (905) being observed in the second week of December, representing 16% more deaths than expected. In the first period, the number of excess deaths and the number of COVID-19 deaths peaked in the same weeks. However, this was not the case in the second period. The weekly number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 continued to rise after the peak of excess deaths in December, reaching 955 deaths in the week ending January 23. A closer examination of the patterns for different age groups reveals a growing disconnect between the population groups experiencing excess mortality and the group with the most COVID-19 deaths. The average age of people dying from COVID-19 has dropped since the beginning of 2021 During the first period of excess mortality in the spring of 2020, there were 4,252 excess deaths and 4,730 deaths caused by COVID-19 among individuals older than 84 years of age. In the second period of excess mortality (from September 2020 to the end of January 2021), the gap between these two numbers widened among this same age group, with 4,094 excess deaths and 5,195 deaths caused by COVID-19, according to the provisional data. The higher number of COVID-19 deaths may be attributable to the disease taking a heavy toll on some individuals who may have been at a high risk of dying over this period, regardless of the pandemic. In addition, the indirect effects of the pandemic, which may have led to decreases in the number of deaths attributable to other causes, could also be at play. Furthermore, in the second period of excess deaths, the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among those over the age of 84 peaked at 525 in the week ending January 16, a week earlier than for the other age groups. Over the following weeks, the share of deaths caused by COVID-19 among those over the age of 84 fell from 56%, in mid-January, to 25%, in April. Prior to this, those aged 85 and older consistently accounted for half or more of weekly COVID-19 deaths. According to the provisional data, the average age of a COVID-19 decedent was around 83 years of age at the beginning of 2021. The average age of those who died of COVID-19 was also 83 years throughout 2020, but by the end of March 2021, the average age had fallen to roughly 76 years. The disproportionate decrease in the number of COVID-19 deaths among those over age 84 in the first few months of 2021 may be due to various factors such as vaccination which began in December and targeted people in this age group. It may also be that those who were most vulnerable to the effects of the virus had died earlier in the pandemic. While we have generally observed excess mortality that is consistent with periods of heightened COVID-19 mortality among the older age groups, this is not true for younger Canadians. Based on the provisional data, from the end of March 2020 to the end of April 2021, there were 7,150 more deaths than expected among those aged 0 to 64 years. Over the same period, 1,600 COVID-19 deaths have been attributed to those younger than 65, suggesting that, in addition to COVID-19, excess mortality may be related to the indirect consequences of the pandemic. Recently, evidence has been presented that this excess may be partly explained by increases in the number deaths associated with substance use and misuse, including unintentional poisonings as well as diseases and conditions related to alcohol consumption. The emergence of COVID-19 variants of concern and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in Canada will continue to change the repercussions of the pandemic. To better understand the evolving impacts of the pandemic on mortality in Canada, Statistics Canada will continue to provide timely information on a regular basis on excess deaths, causes of death and comorbidities as it becomes available. Chart 1 Provisional number of excess deaths and COVID-19 deaths, by period of excess mortality, Canada, March 2020 to January 2021 Note to readers A new updated provisional dataset from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database, covering the period from January 2020 to May 2021, was released today. Updates were also made to the provisional death estimates, which have been adjusted, where possible, to account for the incomplete nature of the counts. The provisional estimates will continue to be revised in future releases as more information is reported by provincial and territorial vital statistics agencies and as estimation methods continue to be enhanced. The data released today are provisional, as they are not based on all deaths that occurred during the reference period because of reporting delays, and they do not include Yukon. Provisional death counts are based on what is reported to Statistics Canada by provincial and territorial vital statistics registries. Provisional death estimates have been adjusted to account for incomplete data, where possible. The numbers of excess deaths discussed in this analysis refer to provisional estimates. Information on the methods used can be found in the ""Definitions, data sources and methods"" section for survey 3233—Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database. The provisional death counts and estimates released today may not match figures from other sources, such as media reports, or counts and estimates from provincial and territorial health authorities and other agencies. There are number of ways to measure excess mortality, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. There are also a number of challenges with measuring excess mortality, most importantly, properly estimating the number of expected deaths that would occur in a non-COVID-19 context as a comparison basis for the current death counts. Important variations may be observed from year to year in the annual death counts, in particular in the less populated provinces and in the territories. Moreover, yearly death counts may be affected by changes in the composition of the population, in regard to age more particularly, and changes in mortality rates (e.g. improvement of mortality). In the Canadian context, with an aging and growing population, the number of deaths has been steadily increasing over recent years and so a higher number of deaths in 2020 and 2021 would be expected regardless of COVID-19. A second challenge is the difficulty to collect timely death counts. In Canada, death data are collected by the provincial and territorial vital statistical offices. The capacity to provide death data to Statistics Canada in a timely manner varies greatly. Taking these considerations into account, the method chosen by Statistics Canada, which has also been adopted by several other countries, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to estimate expected deaths, is adapted from an infectious disease detection algorithm which has been largely utilized in the context of mortality surveillance in recent years. The tabulation of the causes of death is based on the underlying causes of death, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the disease or injury that initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or as the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause of death is selected from the causes and conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death completed by a medical professional, medical examiner or coroner. More information on causes of death, including the certification and classification of COVID-19 deaths, can be found in the study ""COVID-19 death comorbidities in Canada."" The provisional figures on the number of deaths, the causes of death and excess mortality will continue to be updated as more information is reported to Statistics Canada by the provinces and territories and as further enhancements are made to the estimation models. More information on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is available in the article, ""Excess mortality in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic."" Detailed information on the causes of death in Canada for 2020 will be released on November 26, 2021. Rates are a useful tool for comparing characteristics across different populations, different segments of a population, or the same population over time. One type of rate is a percentage, i.e. the number of individuals exhibiting a characteristic or particular behaviour per 100 people. When rates are used to examine unusual events, such as death due to a particular cause, they are often expressed as the number of people or occurrences per 100,000 individuals in the population. As with percentages, these rates take into account the underlying population size. A number of different reference periods have been used in this article: March 2020 to mid-May 2021 refers to the period from the week ending March 28, 2020, to the week ending May 15, 2021. March 2020 to the end of April 2021 refers to the period from the week ending March 28, 2020, to the week ending May 1, 2021. March 2020 to June 2020 (or the first period of excess mortality) refers to the period from the week ending March 28, 2020, to the week ending June 6, 2020. September 2020 to the end of January 2021 (or the second period of excess mortality) refers to the period of the week ending September 26, 2020, to the week ending January 23, 2021. Products To facilitate the identification of trends in excess deaths by province or territory, the product ""Provisional weekly estimates of the number of deaths, expected number of deaths and excess mortality: Interactive Tool"" has been updated. To facilitate the identification of trends in the number of weekly deaths by age group and sex and by province or territory, the product ""Provisional weekly death counts: Interactive tool"" has also been updated.

For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality. Footnote 2 A census metropolitan area (CMA) is a large population centre (known as core) together with adjacent fringe and rural areas that have a high degree of social and economic integration with the cores. A CMA has a population of at least 100,000. Footnote 3 Excluding the territories. Footnote 4 The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed persons expressed as a percentage of the labour force. The unemployment rate for a particular group (age, sex, marital status, etc.) is the number unemployed in that group expressed as a percentage of the labour force for that group. Estimates are percentages, rounded to the nearest tenth. Footnote 5 From 2001 to 2014, due to a slightly smaller sample size relative to other CMAs, the unemployment level and rate in Kelowna and Peterborough has more sampling variability, and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Footnote 1 To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality. How to cite: Statistics Canada.

Between the June and July reference weeks, many jurisdictions substantially eased public health restrictions affecting indoor and outdoor dining, recreation and cultural activities, retail shopping, and personal care services. All public health restrictions—aside from some masking and screening requirements in select settings—were lifted in Alberta (July 1) and Saskatchewan (July 11). British Columbia also lifted virtually all restrictions (July 1), although some capacity limits on certain activities remained. All regions of Quebec moved into the lowest level of restrictions (June 28), followed by a removal of retail capacity limits (July 12). In Ontario, personal care services partially resumed at the end of June, and the province reopened indoor dining and permitted recreational activities, with certain limitations, at the end of the LFS reference week (July 16). In Manitoba, personal care services and restaurants reopened at the end of June, and capacity limits on restaurants, gyms, and retail stores were further eased on July 17. Highlights Employment growth continues in July Employment rose by 94,000 (+0.5%) in July, adding to an increase of 231,000 (+1.2%) in June. The two consecutive months of growth brought employment to 246,000 (-1.3%) below the February 2020 level. Youth aged 15 to 24 and core-aged women aged 25 to 54 accounted for the bulk of the gains. All of the employment gains in July occurred in the private sector, where the number of employees rose by 123,000 (+1.0%). July employment gains were concentrated in full-time work (+83,000; +0.5%); the first increase since March 2021. The number of employees in the public sector fell by 31,000 (-0.7%) in July, the first decline since April 2020. The number of employed people who worked less than half their usual hours fell by 116,000 (-10.1%). Total hours worked were up 1.3% and were 2.7% below their pre-pandemic level. All of the employment gains were in the services-producing sector (+93,000). Employment increased in Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Unemployment trends downward The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 7.5% in July, lower than the recent peak of 9.4% in January 2021. Long-term unemployment was 244,000 higher than in February 2020 and accounted for more than one-quarter (27.8%) of total unemployment in July. Unemployment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 54,000. Among Canadians aged 55 and older, unemployment fell 22,000 (-5.9%). Unemployment for the core-aged population aged 25 to 54 was little changed. The labour underutilization rate declined 1.2 percentage points to 14.4%. July employment gains concentrated in the services-producing sector Employment rose by 35,000 in accommodation and food services. Employment was virtually unchanged in information, culture and recreation, and in retail trade. Following losses in May and June, the number of people who worked in goods-producing industries was little changed in July. The number of people who worked in the manufacturing industry in Ontario increased by 26,000, which fully erased the employment losses recorded in the spring. Employment growth continues in July Employment rose by 94,000 (+0.5%) in July, adding to the 231,000 (+1.2%) increase in June. The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 7.5%. Employment growth in July was almost entirely in Ontario. Youth aged 15 to 24 and core-aged women aged 25 to 54 accounted for the bulk of gains in the month. The two consecutive months of growth brought employment to 246,000 (-1.3%) below the February 2020 level. The employment rate was 60.3% in July, 1.5 percentage points below the pre-pandemic rate. The number of employed people who worked less than half their usual hours fell by 116,000 (-10.1%) in July. Total hours worked were up 1.3% and were 2.7% below their pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Employment rebounds in June and July as public health restrictions ease Private sector employees drive employment growth in July while self-employment remains flat All of the employment gains in July occurred in the private sector, where the number of employees rose by 123,000 (+1.0%), mostly in the accommodation and food services industry. This increase, combined with gains of 251,000 (+2.1%) in June, brought the number of private sector employees to within 1.5% (-191,000) of its February 2020 level. Self-employment was little changed in July and was down 7.1% (-205,000) compared with February 2020. The number of self-employed workers has seen virtually no growth since the onset of the pandemic. The pandemic-related declines have resulted in a small shift in the distribution of the self-employed across industries. Compared with July 2019, the proportion of self-employed workers who worked in accommodation and food services was down 1.0 percentage point to 2.6% (not seasonally adjusted), while the share of those who worked in health care and social assistance increased by 1.7 percentage points to 12.5%. The professional, scientific and technical services industry continued to account for the largest share of self-employed workers (16.9%). The number of employees in the public sector fell by 31,000 (-0.7%) in July, the first decline since April 2020. Nearly half of the monthly decrease was in Quebec (-15,000; -1.5%) and was partly due to a larger-than-usual summer decrease in the number of educational services workers. Despite this decline, public sector employment at the national level was up 150,000 (+3.8%) compared with February 2020. Chart 2 Growth in private sector employees while self-employment is unchanged July employment gains concentrated in full-time work July employment gains were concentrated in full-time work, which rose by 83,000 (+0.5%). The increase in full-time work was the first since March 2021 and was widespread across industries. Part-time employment held steady in July. The overall level of part-time employment was essentially the same as in February 2020, while full-time work was down 1.6% (-253,000). Of all those who worked part-time in July, one in four (25.6%) would have preferred full-time work (30 hours or more per week). In comparison, the involuntary part-time rate averaged 30.3% in the month of July, over the period of 2010 to 2019. For workers, an inability to find full-time work may have a number of consequences, including financial pressures and delays in accumulating employment experience. The share of Canadians working from home falls to its lowest level since October 2020 Among workers who worked at least half their usual hours, the proportion working from home fell 2.0 percentage points to 25.8% in July, returning to the pandemic lows recorded in the fall of 2020. For about half of those who worked from home (51.6%), doing so continues to represent a temporary adaptation to the pandemic. The information, culture and recreation industry saw one of the largest shifts in work location in July, with the proportion of those who worked from home falling 9.0 percentage points to 38.6%. In addition to employment gains or losses, and changes in work location, the number of people working at different locations may be affected by absences, which are typically higher during the summer when workers are more likely to be on vacation. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, working from home has been a key part of public health efforts to reduce infections, with some workers being more able to take advantage of this adaptation than others. A new study, Working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that workers with a bachelor's degree or higher were much more likely to work from home during the pandemic than those without postsecondary education. This continued in July, as workers with a degree remained about three times more likely to be working from home (45.6% vs. 15.7%). Chart 3 Proportion of Canadians working from home returns to level last seen in fall 2020 Largest employment gains among youth and core-aged women Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 increased by 62,000 (+2.5%) in July, with gains split between young men (+36,000; +2.8%) and young women (+26,000; +2.2%). All of the gains for youth were in part-time employment (+63,000; +5.1%). With the July gains, employment for young men returned to its February 2020 level, as a higher level of part-time work (+25,000; +4.6%) offset the decline in full-time work (-43,000;-5.5%). Among young women, part-time work was on par with pre-pandemic levels, while full-time work was down by 34,000 (-6.1%). Employment rose 30,000 (+0.5%) for core-aged women aged 25 to 54 in July, with full-time gains (+73,000; +1.5%) more than compensating for part-time losses (-44,000; -4.2%). Overall, employment was little changed for core-aged men. Core-aged employment was 124,000 (-1.0%) below pre-COVID levels in July, with similar deficits for men (-71,000; -1.1%) and women (-53,000; -0.9%). The employment rate for core-aged mothers whose youngest child was under 18 (74.7%) was 1.2 percentage points lower than in July 2019; whereas the rate for women in this age group without children under 18 (79.7%) was little changed from two years earlier (not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the employment rate was closer to its pre-COVID level for core-aged fathers (91.4%; down 0.9 percentage points) than for non-fathers (82.3%; down 1.6 percentage points) (not seasonally adjusted). Employment among women aged 55 and older fell 20,000 (-1.1%) in July, essentially wiping out June gains and leaving employment for this group 55,000 (-2.9%) below its February 2020 level. Conversely, employment among men in this age group held steady in July and has been little changed since returning to its pre-COVID level in March 2021. Compared with February 2020, the employment rate, which is a reflection of both employment and population size, was down 1.3 percentage points for men aged 55 and older in July, and by 1.7 percentage points for women of the same age group. Teenage students see employment recovery while older students lose ground During the summer months, the Labour Force Survey captures labour market information for youth who were full-time students in March and intended to return to school in September. This information helps to shed light on the experiences of students seeking to develop work experience and to fund their education. July is a particularly important month for student employment, as many high school students enter the labour market in June when school is over, and youth employment opportunities expand in child care and recreation activities for younger school-aged children. In July 2021, the employment rate for returning students aged 15 to 19 was 50.6%; up 2.3 percentage points from the 2015-to-2019 July average and 8.3 percentage points higher than in July 2020. In contrast, the employment rate for returning students aged 20 to 24 (66.2%) was 4.6 percentage points lower than the historical July average, after having returned to average levels in June. LFS results for August will provide an indication of how the entire May-to-August summer job market compares with that of previous years. Year-over-year increase in the employment rate nearly three times as large among visible minority Canadians July 2021 marks one year since Statistics Canada first started collecting data on the labour market situation of population groups designated as visible minorities through the LFS. Year-over-year comparisons of labour market indicators provide new insights on how diverse groups of Canadians have fared since July 2020, a point in time when the unequal impacts of the pandemic first became apparent, as well as the longer-term differences in labour market circumstances between population groups. The employment rate—the proportion of the population aged 15 and older that is employed—provides key information on the extent to which employment has recovered relative to the size of different diverse groups. From July 2020 to July 2021, employment rate increases were recorded for five of the seven largest population groups designated as visible minorities (not seasonally adjusted), led by South Asian (+11.0 percentage points to 73.5%), Black (+8.9 to 75.4%) and Latin American Canadians (+8.4 to 73.8%). Overall, the year-over-year increase in the employment rate was nearly three times as large among visible minority Canadians (+7.3 percentage points to 70.3%, not seasonally adjusted) than among their counterparts who are not Indigenous or a visible minority (+2.6 percentage points to 70.8%). Employment rate for very recent immigrants continues to climb The employment rate for very recent immigrants (in Canada for five years or less) continued its upward trend in July, reaching 69.1%, or 5.3 percentage points higher than in July 2019 (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). This trend has been strongly influenced by a drop in the number of newcomers to Canada since February 2020, a direct result of COVID-19 travel restrictions. Among immigrants who have been in Canada for more than five years, the employment rate was 58.1% in July, down 2.2 percentage points compared with July 2019. For those born in Canada, the employment rate was 61.0%, down 2.5 percentage points from its pre-COVID level (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). Employment rate for Indigenous men remains at pre-pandemic level In July, the employment rate among Indigenous men was 60.4%, little changed from July 2019. In comparison, the rate among non-Indigenous men was 65.3%, 1.9 percentage points lower than before the pandemic. The employment rate for Indigenous women (53.6%) was 2.0 percentage points lower than its pre-pandemic level, while among non-Indigenous women, the rate (56.4%) was 2.2 percentage points lower (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). LFS information for Indigenous people reflects the experience of those who identify as First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, and who live off reserve in the provinces. Unemployment trends downward The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 7.5% in July, considerably lower than the recent peak of 9.4% in January 2021. Prior to the COVID pandemic, the unemployment rate reached a historic low of 5.4% in May 2019, and was 5.7% in February 2020. The adjusted unemployment rate—which includes those who wanted a job but did not look for one—was 9.5% in July, down 0.6 percentage points from one month earlier. Chart 4 Unemployment continues downward trend following pandemic-related spikes Long-term unemployment remains elevated despite decline in July The total number of unemployed fell by 70,000 (-4.4%) in July, including a drop of 54,000 (-11.3%) among those who had been out of work for 27 weeks or more. Long-term unemployment was 244,000 (+135.9%) higher than in February 2020 and accounted for more than one-quarter (27.8%) of total unemployment in July. The number of people unemployed for a year or more accounted for more than two-thirds (68.8%) of the long-term unemployed, the highest proportion on record since comparable data became available in 1976. Unemployment falls among youngest and oldest workers Unemployment among youth aged 15 to 24 fell by 54,000 in July, with similar declines for young men (-25,000; -11.7%) and young women (-29,000; -16.5%). Among young men, the unemployment rate was down 1.8 percentage points to 12.6%, essentially returning to its February 2020 rate. The unemployment rate for young women (10.6%) was lower than the rate for young men, but was 1.6 percentage points above its pre-COVID level. Among Canadians aged 55 and older, unemployment fell 22,000 (-5.9%) in July, with the decline occurring primarily among older women on temporary layoff. The unemployment rate for older women (7.9%) was 2.9 percentage points higher than in February 2020. The pattern was similar for men of the same age, with the unemployment rate sitting at 7.8%, 2.5 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level. Unemployment for the core-aged population aged 25 to 54 was little changed from June. The unemployment rates for men (6.8%) and women (6.0%) in this age group were higher than in February 2020 (2.0 percentage points higher for men and 1.3 percentage points higher for women). Unemployment rate falls among South Asian Canadians After falling in June, the overall unemployment rate among 15- to 69-year-olds who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities held steady in July at 10.2%. A notable decline was recorded in the South Asian population (-4.1 percentage points to 8.1%, not seasonally adjusted). Nearly half of the South Asian population (44.4%) lives in the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), where employment increased considerably in July. In contrast, the unemployment rate increased among Filipino (+3.1 percentage points to 10.1%) and Chinese Canadians (+1.6 percentage points to 11.8%). The unemployment rate also rose among people who were not Indigenous or a visible minority (+0.4 percentage points to 6.5%, not seasonally adjusted). Among youth, the unemployment rate fell 1.3 percentage points to 10.9% nationally for non-visible minority Canadians (not seasonally adjusted), but was little changed for population groups designated as visible minorities overall (17.1%). Compared with a year earlier, the unemployment rate among population groups designated as visible minorities was down 6.1 percentage points in July 2021, while it was 2.8 percentage points lower among non-visible minority Canadians (not seasonally adjusted). Labour market underutilization at lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic The labour underutilization rate—which complements the unemployment rate by capturing a broader range of people who are available and want to work but did not search for work, as well as those who worked less than half their usual hours—declined 1.2 percentage points to 14.4% in July. Most components of the underutilization rate dropped, led by the number of people who were employed but who worked less than half their usual hours (-116,000; -10.1%); the number of people who were on temporary layoff (-93,000; -45.3%); and the number people who were not in the labour force but wanted to work (-65,000; -12.5%). Despite these decreases, most components of the underutilization rate remained higher than before the pandemic. Compared with February 2020, there were more people who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours (+225,000; +27.7%); more job searchers (+369,000; +35.5%); and more people who wanted a job but did not look for one (+55,000; +14.0%). In contrast, the number of people on temporary layoff was virtually the same as it was pre-pandemic for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Infographic 1 Labour underutilization at lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic Participation in the labour force reaches pre-pandemic level for most groups The total labour force is the sum of the employed and the unemployed. The labour force participation rate—the labour force as a proportion of the population aged 15 and older—is an indicator of the balance between the number people who are working or looking for work, and the number of people who are pursuing other activities, including studying, caring for family members and pursuing leisure or voluntary activities. After dipping in April and May and rebounding in June, both the total labour force and the labour force participation rate held steady in July. The participation rate, at 65.2%, was 0.3 percentage points below February 2020. Youth labour force participation was little changed in July, and the participation rates of both young women (64.5%) and young men (64.6%) were on par with pre-COVID levels. The labour force participation rate among core-aged women rose 0.5 percentage points in July to 83.7%, while the rate was unchanged among core-aged men (91.5%). The rate for men was 0.5 percentage points higher than in February 2020, while for women it was little changed from its pre-pandemic level. Labour force participation among those aged 55 and older fell 0.3 percentage points in July, with all of the decline occurring among older women (down 0.6 percentage points to 31.7%). While the participation rate for older men has been stable since essentially returning to its pre-pandemic level in May, the rate for older women was 0.8 percentage points lower in July than in February 2020, after having essentially returned to its pre-pandemic level in June. July employment gains concentrated in the services-producing sector All of the employment gains in July were in the services-producing sector (+93,000), with increases recorded in the accommodation and food services (+35,000), and finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (+15,000) industries. Following losses in May and June, the number of people who worked in goods-producing industries was little changed in July. Chart 5 Employment in accommodation and food services furthest below its pre-COVID level More people working in accommodation and food services Employment rose by 35,000 in accommodation and food services in July, building on a notable gain of 101,000 in June. Most of the monthly increase was attributable to Ontario and Manitoba. Restaurants in Ontario began to welcome back customers for indoor dining at the end of the LFS reference week. While there were more people working in the industry in July 2021 than in July 2020, employment in accommodation and food services was 18.7% (-228,000) below its February 2020 level in July 2021. Among industries where employment had not yet returned to pre-COVID levels, accommodation and food services accounted for over one-third (36.3%) of the overall difference between current and February 2020 employment. Food and beverage servers working in the industry continue to be disproportionately impacted. In July 2021, employment in this occupational group was 109,000 (-37.7%) below the level recorded in July 2019, and little changed compared with July 2020 (not seasonally adjusted). Employment rises in finance, insurance and real estate following two months of little change In July 2021, the number of people who worked in the finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing industry increased for the first time since April, rising 15,000 (+1.1%). Employment in the industry first surpassed its pre-COVID level in November 2020, and was 5.3% (+66,000) above its pre-COVID level in July 2021. Throughout the pandemic, many workers in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing have adapted to public health restrictions by working from home. Among 15- to 69-year-olds who worked at least half their usual hours, the industry had the second-highest proportion of workers working from home in July (58.6%, not seasonally adjusted). Little growth in retail trade, and information, culture and recreation Employment was virtually unchanged in the hard-hit information, culture and recreation industry. The recovery in this industry continues to be constrained by travel restrictions and limitations on the size of public gatherings. In July, employment in the industry was 8.7% (-68,000) lower than the level recorded before the pandemic in February 2020. The number of people who worked in retail trade was also little changed in July, and remained 2.7% (-61,000) below its pre-COVID level. While public health restrictions affecting the industry have been eased across the country, retail stores in many provinces still faced some degree of capacity limitations through late June or early July. According to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, total job vacancies in retail trade held steady from March to May 2021 (not seasonally adjusted). Ontario manufacturing employment recoups spring losses While employment was little changed in the goods-producing sector overall in July, a notable increase was recorded in Ontario (+20,000), largely as a result of gains in manufacturing. The number of people who worked in the manufacturing industry in Ontario increased by 26,000, which fully erased employment losses recorded in the spring. This monthly gain in Ontario was offset by losses in Quebec (-11,000) and British Columbia (-11,000). Nationally, the number of people who worked in manufacturing in July was similar to its pre-COVID level. Employment up in four provinces Employment increased in four provinces in July, with Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island seeing gains. Saskatchewan was the only province where employment dropped. For the second consecutive month, British Columbia was the lone province with employment above its pre-pandemic level. Compared with February 2020, the employment gap was largest in Saskatchewan (-3.6%), Prince Edward Island (-3.5%), New Brunswick (-2.5%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (-2.2%). For further information on key province and industry-level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" After dropping in April and May and increasing in June, employment in Ontario rose by 72,000 (+1.0%) in July, including an increase of 49,000 (+1.5%) in the Toronto census metropolitan area. While manufacturing led the provincial employment increase, accommodation and food services and wholesale and retail trade also saw gains, as the province's reopening plan allowed restaurants to resume indoor dining and retail stores to remove capacity limits. The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 8.0%. In Manitoba, employment increased by 7,400 (+1.1%) in July, and the unemployment rate dropped 1.5 percentage points to 6.1%. Gains were predominantly in accommodation and food services, and information, culture and recreation. Employment in Nova Scotia increased by 3,700 (+0.8%) in July, and the unemployment rate dropped 0.6 percentage points to 8.4%. All of the gains were in full-time work and were mostly in health care and social assistance. Prince Edward Island saw employment rise by 1,100 (+1.4%) in July, following a decline of similar magnitude the previous month. The unemployment rate fell 2.9 percentage points to 9.6%. In Saskatchewan, employment declined (-4,500; -0.8%) for the second consecutive month, while the unemployment rate was little changed at 7.0%. Decreases in wholesale and retail trade accounted for nearly half (45.5%) of the cumulative two-month employment decline. Labour market churn remains below pre-COVID baseline As the easing of COVID-19 public health restrictions continues, employers face a number of challenges in resuming full business activities. At the same time, workers face their own challenges, whether they are returning to their previous industries and occupations, or entering new fields. During this period of adjustment between labour supply and demand, supplementary measures of labour market churn—the number of people changing employment status or changing jobs—are important complements to concepts such as employment, unemployment and job vacancies. For example, some aspects of churn, such as voluntary job changes, can be an indicator of whether workers feel confident in seeking new employment. Beyond the overall net changes in the number of people who are employed, unemployed, or not in the labour force, the Labour Force Survey tracks two particular groups of workers who flow out of employment and remain jobless in the LFS reference week: those who lost a job in the past 12 months and those who left a job in the past 12 months. These indicators are part of the baseline level of churn in the labour market. At the height of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, the number of core-aged people (aged 25 to 54) who lost a job due to permanent or temporary layoff in the previous 12 months was at a record high 2.0 million in April 2020. Since then, the number has gradually returned to levels consistent with the pre-pandemic baseline, and in July 2021 stood at 555,000 (not seasonally adjusted). While the number of people who lost a job spiked as a result of COVID-19, the number of job leavers—people who left a job voluntarily in the previous 12 months and remained not employed in the LFS reference week—trended down throughout 2020 and 2021, reaching a record low of 217,000 in April 2021. Since then, the number of job leavers has increased in parallel with improving labour market conditions, but has remained substantially below pre-COVID levels. In July, there were 257,000 core-aged job leavers, down 28.3% (-101,000) compared with July 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). In addition to flows into and out of employment, labour market churn includes workers who remain employed from one month to the next but who change jobs. The job-changing rate was 0.6% in July 2021. In other words, of people who were employed in both June and July, fewer than one in 160 (0.6%) changed jobs between the two months. After dropping to close to zero in May 2020, the job changing rate has gradually increased over the past year but has remained below the 2019 average of 0.7%. Among employees who change jobs from one month to another, a certain proportion earn higher wages in their new job. Indeed, seeking higher income may be a key factor in the decision to change jobs. In July, 53.9% of job changers earned a higher wage in their new job, compared with an average of 49.5% in 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). Taken together, these various indicators of churn suggest that the labour market is not yet providing the conditions necessary to fully encourage the typical level of voluntary job turnover among workers. Chart 6 Job-changing rate approaching pre-COVID level Wage growth strongly influenced by changes in the composition of employment Wage growth is another important indicator of labour market conditions. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, year-over-year growth in average hourly wages of all employees averaged 3.5% in 2019. Since then, year-over-year wage growth has varied widely, from +10.9% in April 2020 to -1.8% in April 2021. These large changes have been the result of several factors, including large COVID-related shifts in some of the employment characteristics most closely associated with wage levels. For example, among the five occupational groups with the lowest average hourly wages in 2019, the number of employees dropped sharply (-430,000; -14.3%) between July 2019 and July 2020 and then partially recovered (+237,000; +9.2%) by July 2021. In contrast, the number of employees in the five highest-paid occupations was little changed from July 2019 to July 2020 and increased by 116,000 (+6.4%) in the past 12 months (not seasonally adjusted). Similarly, the large employment losses and gains resulting from COVID-19 have contributed to shifts in the balance between people who have been with their employer for a shorter time, and who are generally lower-paid, and people with more years of tenure. The proportion of employees who had been in their current job for 6 months or less was 13.2% in July 2021, up 3.6 percentage points compared with one year earlier and similar to July 2019 (13.6%) (not seasonally adjusted). Various methods exist to provide a clearer picture of wage trends by removing the effects of changes in the composition of employment. One such method—a fixed-weighted average wage, which holds the distribution of employees across occupations and job tenures constant at the 2019 average—shows that pandemic-related changes in the distribution of employees across occupations and job tenure continue to impact indicators of wage growth. At the onset of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, when there was a sudden reduction in the number of lower-wage and lower-tenure employees, average hourly wages were 10.3% (+$2.87) higher in April 2020 than the 2019 average. Using a fixed-weighted wage level to control for compositional change, this increase is reduced to less than half (+4.9%; +$1.33). Since that time, the difference between the actual and the fixed-weighted average wage has narrowed. Nonetheless, in July 2021, the actual average hourly wage was $1.84 (+6.6%) higher than the 2019 average, whereas the fixed-weighted average wage was $1.44 (+5.2%) higher, demonstrating that accounting for changes in the composition of employment across occupation and job tenures remains important for understanding wage growth in the current context. Chart 7 Changes to labour market composition impact wage trends Looking ahead: immigration and Canada's labour market Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the key issues facing the Canadian labour market was whether the impact of population aging, which was putting downward pressure on labour force growth, could be mitigated through increased immigration and higher participation among groups typically under-represented in the labour market. From 2016, the number of very recent immigrants (those who arrived within the previous five years) who were participating in the labour force increased notably, and reached 752,000 in 2019. In 2020, the growth of this group stalled as a result of the number of newcomers entering Canada falling to a record low due to COVID-related travel restrictions. So far in 2021, the number of very recent immigrants participating in the labour force has returned to 2019 levels, averaging 749,000—3.7% of the total labour force—in the seven months from January to July. Chart 8 Number of very recent immigrants in Canada's labour force stalls during COVID As travel restrictions begin to ease, LFS results in the coming months will shed light on whether the number of new immigrants participating in Canada's labour market will continue to grow.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for July are for the week of July 11 to 17. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). Since March 2020, all LFS face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both respondents and interviewers. While this has resulted in a decline in the LFS response rate, more than 40,000 interviews were completed in July and in-depth data quality evaluations conducted each month confirm that the Labour Force Survey continues to produce an accurate portrait of Canada's labour market. The suspension of face-to-face interviewing has had a larger impact on response rates in Nunavut than in other jurisdictions. Due to the larger decline in response rates for Nunavut, and resulting changes in the composition of the responding sample, data for Nunavut (table 14-10-0292) should be used with caution. To reduce the risks associated with declining data quality for Nunavut, users are advised to use 12-month averages (available upon request) rather than 3-month averages when possible. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the quality of LFS data for Nunavut each month and provide users with updated guidelines as required. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. The distribution of LFS interviews in July 2021 compared with June 2021, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • June 2021: 64.2% • July 2021: 63.6% Online interviews • June 2021: 35.8% • July 2021: 36.4% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. The five occupation groups with the lowest average hourly wages in 2019: sales support occupations; service support and other service occupations, n.e.c.; service supervisors and specialized service occupations; labourers in processing, manufacturing and utilities; and service representatives and other customer and personal services occupations. The five occupation groups with the highest average hourly wages in 2019: professional occupations in natural and applied sciences; occupations in front-line public protection services; middle management occupations in trades, transportation, production and utilities; specialized middle management occupations; senior management occupations. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in July 2021 analysis Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business,' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Information on population groups Since July 2020, the LFS has included a question asking respondents to report the population group(s) to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2021 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, people who identify as a member of a population group (visible minority) are analyzed separately. Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Next release The next release of the LFS will be on September 10, 2021. August data will reflect labour market conditions during the week of August 15 to 21.

Payroll employment rose by 214,800 (+1.3%) in June, driven by increases in the services-producing sector in Ontario and Quebec. At the same time, average weekly earnings fell, as job gains were concentrated in lower-paying industries. In June, public health measures implemented against the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly eased. As a result, indoor and outdoor dining, recreation and cultural activities, retail shopping, and personal care services resumed or continued in most areas of the country, with varying degrees of capacity restrictions. In Ontario, personal care services partially resumed at the end of the month; however, indoor dining and gyms remained closed. Services-producing sector drives payroll employment increase in June with the easing of public health measures There were 214,800 (+1.3%) more employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer in June—measured in the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) as payroll employment—the strongest monthly growth since March 2021. The June Labour Force Survey (LFS) reported 230,700 (+1.2%) more people employed (including self-employed). The increases in both the SEPH and the LFS were driven by the services-producing sector, as the easing of public health measures allowed many businesses in accommodation and food services and in retail trade to reopen. Payroll employment rose in six provinces in June. Ontario (+95,500; +1.6%) and Quebec (+79,200; +2.1%) accounted for most of the increase. Compared with February 2020, payroll employment in Canada was down by 769,900 (-4.5%) in June. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in June Accommodation and food services and retail trade account for half of the June payroll employment increase Just over half of the June payroll employment increase was in accommodation and food services (+77,400; +8.7%) and retail trade (+35,300; +1.9%), two sectors where employment has been most susceptible to changes in public health measures throughout the pandemic. Most of the June employment increase in these two sectors occurred in Ontario and Quebec, consistent with the loosening of public health measures in these provinces following the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all of the gain in payroll employment in accommodation and food services occurred in the food services and drinking places subsector. In retail trade, payroll employment rose in 10 of the 12 subsectors, with the largest increases in clothing and clothing accessories stores and general merchandise stores. In June, payroll employment was 28.2% below the pre-COVID-19 level in accommodation and food services, while it was 3.7% below in retail trade. Payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services continues upward trend Payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services has been on an upward trend since June 2020 and continued to rise in June 2021, increasing by 16,800 (+1.6%). This increase was spread across all industries, led by accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and payroll services (+5,300; +4.3%), and architectural, engineering and related services (+3,700; +1.8%). A large share (84%) of jobs in this sector can potentially be performed from home, according to a previous Statistics Canada analysis, limiting the impact of public health measures on employment in the sector. Most of the employment growth in the sector occurred in Ontario (+7,500; +1.7%) and Quebec (+4,400; +1.8%). In June, payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services was 5.8% above the February 2020 level. Employment in scientific research and development services was the furthest above its pre-pandemic level (+11.8%), followed by computer systems design and related services (+11.4%), while employment in advertising, public relations, and related services was the furthest below (-7.1%). Compared with February 2020, average weekly earnings in professional, scientific and technical services were up 4.1% to $1,523. Average weekly earnings decrease in June as job gains are concentrated in lower-paying industries Average weekly earnings decreased 1.0% to $1,125 from May to June, partly because the employment gains were concentrated in lower-paying sectors. The largest employment gains in June were in the two sectors with the lowest average weekly earnings: accommodation and food services ($457 per week) and retail trade ($643 per week). While average weekly earnings were down in June compared with May, they were 7.6% higher than in February 2020. This increase reflects a number of factors, including changes in the composition of employment by type of employee (hourly or salaried) and changes in the overall employment distribution by sector. At the onset of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, job losses were largest in some of the lower-paying sectors. These sectors have also remained furthest from their pre-pandemic employment levels. In June 2021, payroll employment in arts, entertainment and recreation, where average earnings were $729 per week, was 38.8% below its February 2020 level. In accommodation and food services ($457 per week), employment was 28.2% below its pre-COVID-19 level. In contrast, two of the sectors with the highest average weekly earnings had surpassed their pre-pandemic employment levels. Employment in professional, scientific and technical services ($1,523 per week) was 5.8% higher in June 2021 compared with February 2020, and employment in finance and insurance ($1,453 per week) was 1.6% higher. The disproportionate loss of employment in lower-paying sectors has the effect of increasing overall average earnings. Chart 2 Payroll employment remains furthest from pre-COVID-19 levels in lower-paying sectors Within each sector, changes in average weekly earnings are also influenced by factors, such as the share of employment by different occupation and job tenure. In the July LFS, a fixed-weighted index was used to control for these compositional changes. The results showed that while overall average hourly wages in June 2021 were 7.0% higher than the 2019 average, this was reduced to a 5.2% increase when controlling for occupation and tenure. Average hours worked decrease for hourly employees Hourly paid employees worked an average of 31.2 hours in June, down 1.3% from May. Average hours worked per week for salaried employees were 37.1, little changed from the previous month. Job vacancies in accommodation and food services drive vacancy rate to new high in June Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 815,800 positions in June 2021, as public health measures related to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly eased. While monthly and quarterly Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) statistics are not directly comparable, quarterly JVWS estimates show that prior to the pandemic, second-quarter job vacancies reached 581,600 in 2019 (data from the JVWS are unadjusted for seasonality). The job vacancy rate, which measures vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied), reached 5.0% in June. This was the highest job vacancy rate since monthly job vacancy estimates became available in October 2020. The large majority of June vacancies—8 in 10—were in the services-producing sector. The number of job vacancies in accommodation and food services (129,100) surpassed that in health care and social assistance (109,300), which had previously led all sectors since November 2020. Retail trade (94,300) had the third-highest number of job vacancies. Among all sectors, the job vacancy rate was highest in accommodation and food services (12.7%) in June, as the number of job vacancies reached a record high. With public health restrictions affecting this sector beginning to ease, outdoor dining resumed in late May or early June in many regions, and employers were actively recruiting to fill vacant positions. British Columbia (6.0%) and Quebec (5.8%) had the highest job vacancy rates among the provinces in June. Job vacancy rates were lowest in Manitoba (3.7%) and Nova Scotia (3.8%). Quarterly JVWS estimates provide more detailed information on job vacancies such as the type of work, occupation and average offered hourly wage. Estimates for the second quarter of 2021 will be released on September 21. Looking ahead: Further loosening and lifting of public health measures In July, public health measures were further loosened or lifted in Alberta, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. July SEPH data—to be released on September 28—will provide detailed information on sectors and subsectors that may have benefited from this further loosening of public health measures. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. Payroll employment, as measured by the SEPH, refers to the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and the LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and the SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are published on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows both quarterly and monthly estimates to be produced. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupation for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions; offered hourly wages; and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time data tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on September 13. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours, and job vacancies for July will be released on September 28.

Research shows that the majority of crimes are not reported to police; therefore, data collected through surveys on self-reported victimization help provide a more complete picture of the nature and prevalence of crime. Results from the 2019 GSS are being released today in the Juristat article ""Criminal victimization in Canada, 2019."" Analysis focuses on the prevalence of victimization, the characteristics of victims and incidents, and the impacts and consequences of victimization. In addition, levels of reporting to police and factors associated with the decision to report victimization to police are examined. Data collection for the 2019 GSS ended in March 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to take hold and drastically change the daily lives of everyone living in Canada. Though the data do not reflect the circumstances of the pandemic, they do present important baseline information on the patterns, impacts and consequences of victimization just prior to the pandemic. Almost 6 million Canadians reported that they or their household had been affected by crime in 2019 One in five Canadians—19%, or nearly 6 million people 15 years and older—reported that they or their household had experienced at least one of the crimes measured by the GSS in 2019. In total, there were more than 8 million incidents of criminal victimization, including sexual assault, robbery, physical assault, break and enter, theft of motor vehicles or parts, theft of household or personal property, and vandalism. Because of changes in collection methods for the GSS on Victimization, most notably the introduction of an online questionnaire to provide another way for Canadians to participate, comparisons with previous cycles are not recommended (see Note to readers). The majority of these self-reported incidents—almost 7 in 10 (69%)—were non-violent in nature. Theft of personal property was the most common type of crime, accounting for more than one-third (37%) of all incidents. Chart 1 Self-reported victimization, by type of victimization, Canada, 2019 More than 4 in 10 (42%) of those who were victimized personally or whose household was victimized experienced multiple incidents of crime. In all, there were just over 2.6 million incidents of self-reported violent victimization (sexual assault, robbery and physical assault) in Canada in 2019. Expressed as a rate, there were 83 incidents of violent crime for every 1,000 Canadians 15 years and older. Physical assault was most common (46 incidents per 1,000 population), followed by sexual assault (30) and robbery (7). This is similar to police-reported data, which also show that physical assault is the most common type of violent crime and that sexual assault is more common than robbery. Compared with the overall population, young people, women and sexual minorities are at higher risk of experiencing violence Certain population groups were disproportionately impacted by violent victimization, according to the 2019 GSS. For example, young Canadians were more at risk of being a victim of a violent crime, with victimization rates highest among those aged 15 to 24 (176 incidents per 1,000 population) and those aged 25 to 34 (135 per 1,000). Rates declined with age, dropping to 20 incidents per 1,000 population among those aged 65 and older. The rate of self-reported violent victimization was nearly twice as high among women (106 incidents per 1,000 women) than among men (59 incidents per 1,000 men) in 2019. This difference was driven by sexual assault, the rate of which was more than five times higher among women (50 per 1,000) than men (9 per 1,000). Chart 2 Self-reported violent victimization, by gender of victim and type of victimization, Canada, 2019 In 2019, the violent victimization rate among bisexual Canadians was 655 incidents per 1,000 population, over nine times higher than that among heterosexual Canadians (70 per 1,000). There were no statistically significant differences in victimization rates between heterosexual Canadians and those who are lesbian or gay. After other factors were controlled for, age, gender and sexual orientation all remained significantly associated with the likelihood of being victimized. Young people, women and people who reported a minority sexual identity were more at risk. Rates of violent victimization higher among Indigenous people and people with a disability Rates of violent victimization were almost three times higher among people with a disability (141 incidents per 1,000) than among those with no disability (53 per 1,000). In particular, women with a disability were more likely to be victimized, with 184 violent incidents for every 1,000 women with a disability, compared with 84 per 1,000 men with a disability. The overall violent victimization rate among people designated as belonging to a visible minority group did not differ significantly from the rate for non–visible minorities. Relative to the overall visible minority population, rates were similar among Filipino people, while those who identified as Chinese recorded lower violent victimization rates. Because of the sample size, more detailed disaggregation of victimization rates among diverse populations is not possible. In 2019, the rate of violent victimization among Indigenous people (First Nations, Métis or Inuit) (177 per 1,000) was more than double that among non-Indigenous people (80 per 1,000). In particular, Métis (225 per 1,000) and Inuit (265 per 1,000; use with caution) had higher rates; the violent victimization rate among First Nations people was not statistically different from that among non-Indigenous people. A multitude of factors impact victimization rates, and differing victimization rates among certain populations may be related to variations in the prevalence of other risk factors among these groups. For example, childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for future victimization, and, based on the GSS on Victimization, Indigenous people experienced higher rates of physical and sexual abuse during childhood. The physical and sexual abuse of Indigenous children is a well-documented aspect of the historical and ongoing trauma and violence brought on by colonization, residential schools and the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the child welfare system. Childhood experiences of abuse, harsh parenting, neglect and witnessing violence are associated with higher rates of violent victimization Research to date has found that adverse childhood experiences, such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, harsh parenting or neglect, and exposure to violence in the home, have all been linked to subsequent experiences of victimization in adulthood. Results from the 2019 GSS provide further support for these links. Violent victimization rates were three to four times higher among people who were physically abused, sexually abused, experienced harsh parenting, and were exposed to violence in the home before the age of 15, compared with those who did not have these experiences. Further information on child maltreatment is presented in the infographic ""Childhood maltreatment and the link with victimization in adulthood: Findings from the 2019 General Social Survey,"" also available today. Most criminal incidents are not reported to police In 2019, most incidents of victimization were not reported to police, with about 3 in 10 (29%) coming to the attention of police. On the whole, incidents of household victimization were more likely than violent incidents to have been brought to the attention of police (35% versus 24%). One reason for this could be related to requirements set out by insurance companies for claims for stolen or damaged property, which was a reason cited by 45% of people who reported an incident of household crime to police. Of all crimes measured by the GSS, sexual assault had the lowest rate of reporting to police, with 6% of incidents in 2019 having come to the attention of police. This figure is consistent with results from other self-reported surveys conducted both before and after the #MeToo movement. Victims of violent crime may choose to report—or not report—an incident to police for a wide range of reasons. In 2019, about half of all victims of violent crime who did not report the incident to police did not report it because they felt that the crime was too minor (56%), the incident was not important enough (53%), they did not want the hassle of dealing with police (49%), the incident was private or personal (48%), or they felt no one was harmed (47%). Note to readers This Juristat article is based on results from the 2019 General Social Survey (GSS) on Canadians' Safety (Victimization). The main objective of the GSS on Victimization is to better understand issues related to the safety and security of Canadians, including perceptions of crime and the justice system, experiences of intimate partner violence, and how safe people feel in their communities. The GSS on Victimization asked Canadians about their experiences with eight types of offences: Violent victimization: Sexual assault, robbery or physical assault. Sexual assault: Forced sexual activity; attempted forced sexual activity; unwanted sexual touching, grabbing, kissing or fondling; or sexual relations without being able to give consent. Robbery: Theft or attempted theft in which the offender had a weapon or there was violence or the threat of violence against the victim. Physical assault: An attack (victim hit, slapped, grabbed, knocked down or beaten), a face-to-face threat of physical harm, or an incident with a weapon present. Theft of personal property: Theft or attempted theft of personal property such as money, credit cards, clothing, jewellery, a purse or a wallet. Unlike robbery, the offender does not confront the victim. Household victimization: Break and enter, theft of motor vehicles or parts, theft of household property, or vandalism. Break and enter: Illegal entry or attempted entry into a residence or other building on the victim's property. Theft of motor vehicle or parts: Theft or attempted theft of a car, truck, van, motorcycle, moped or other vehicle, or part of a motor vehicle. Theft of household property: Theft or attempted theft of household property such as liquor, bicycles, electronic equipment, tools or appliances. Vandalism: Wilful damage of personal or household property. To modernize collection activities and give Canadians another means through which they could participate in the survey, the GSS included the option to respond to the survey online in 2019. Any significant change in survey methodology can affect the comparability of the data over time. It is impossible to determine with certainty whether, and to what extent, differences in a variable are attributable to an actual change in the population and the behaviours being examined or to changes in the survey methodology between the collection cycles. Consequently, comparisons of 2019 GSS results with results of previous GSS cycles conducted without the use of online questionnaires are not recommended, as any differences may be the result of a change in collection method rather than reflect actual changes in victimization patterns. Methodological analysis shows that the data are of good quality and present an accurate picture of criminal victimization in Canada in 2019.

The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was experienced in Canada early during the second quarter of 2021. In April, the number of positive COVID-19 cases grew to its highest levels since January 2021. Consequently, provinces enacted public health measures in several regions across the country which directly affected the performance of businesses in Canada. Input costs for Canadian businesses grew 6.1% on average over the second quarter, higher than the 5.7% increase seen in the first quarter. While an increase in the price of lumber drove the rise, input costs rose across most product lines, which drove up the costs of goods sold for Canadian producers. Consequently, net income before taxes in the non-financial sector declined by 2.0% in the quarter. During the quarter, a worldwide shortage of semiconductor chips strongly contributed to the 1.0% decrease in net income before tax in the motor vehicles and trailer manufacturing industry. The shortage also caused a decline in exports of motor vehicles and parts due to partial shutdowns during the period. Property and casualty insurers in Canada report an increase in claims over the quarter The property and casualty insurance industry reported an increase in the number of claims compared with the previous period. Later in June, a number of weather-related events damaged crops. Moreover, dry conditions prompted wildfires which may negatively impact the earnings of property and casualty insurance carriers in the next quarter. Life, health and medical insurers in Canada saw an increase of 15.0% in net income before tax, supported by favourable foreign exchange rates during the period. Over the second quarter, the Canadian dollar appreciated 181 basis points against the US dollar reaching its highest level since 2014. Life insurance reported a slight decrease in claims, further buoying results. The net income before taxes for wood and paper manufacturing edged up over the quarter In the wood product and paper industry, lumber prices continued to climb for the first half of the quarter. In May 2021, lumber prices were 123.3% higher year over year. However, prices for forestry products began to fall in the following month. Nonetheless, the industry saw an increase in net income before taxes by 1.5% over the quarter. A dispute over the Line 5 pipeline prompted worries over crude supply Over the quarter, oil and gas extraction and support services reported a net income before taxes of $1.4 billion, driven by an increase in the price of crude oil. Simultaneously, a dispute between the State of Michigan and Enbridge prompted fears over a major interruption in crude supply through the Line 5 pipeline, leading to a decline in oil prices, before quickly recovering. A shutdown of the pipeline would mean that crude oil would be transported via rail to eastern Canada or stored in available terminals. Furthermore, interrupted operation of Line 5 would mean that active crude refineries in eastern Canada would face supply shortages. The effects of these events may be reflected in future quarters as the dispute is resolved in the courts. Chart 1 Corporate net income before taxes (seasonally adjusted) Dashboard now available The Quarterly Survey of Financial Statistics: Visualization Tool is a comprehensive analytical tool that presents quarterly changes in the financial performance of enterprises. Note to readers Data from the Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements (QSFS) include amounts from government programs that support businesses, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. These amounts are considered to be revenue for these businesses. However, given lower response rates than historical averages, a potential delay in the release of this information by businesses and the methodology used to calculate QSFS estimates, use of these government support programs may be underestimated in the published data. Data on quarterly net income before taxes in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Quarterly financial statistics for enterprises are based on a sample survey and represent the activities of all corporations in Canada, except those that are government-controlled or not for profit. The survey collects data on balance sheets, income statements and additional disclosures of enterprises. An enterprise can be a single corporation or a family of corporations under common ownership or control, for which consolidated financial statements are produced. Survey changes The following changes were introduced to the survey starting with the first quarter of 2020: New content was implemented in the first quarter to align the survey with new accounting standards adopted by corporations starting in 2011. New industrial breakdowns were implemented, allowing for more granularity in the dissemination of data. As a result, some industry groupings were merged, others were split, and some remained the same. The survey sample was modified to support the new industrial breakdowns. However, a maximum sample overlap with the previous sample was adopted. A more automated imputation strategy was implemented to streamline the process and reduce the need for manual intervention. Revisions, benchmarking and backcasting The release of the QSFS in the second quarter of 2021 includes revised estimates for the first quarter of 2021. Efforts are being made to backcast these data to the first quarter of 2010 to allow for better historical comparisons. However, as more than one cycle of new content is required before this exercise can begin, users are encouraged to use caution when making historical comparisons. It is expected that backcasting will be completed and results released at the end of 2021. Larger-than-usual revisions may be anticipated in the future, as quarterly revisions, annual benchmarking, backcasting and new survey data received from respondents will be incorporated to improve data quality and include the most up-to-date data. Business performance and ownership statistics portal The Business performance and ownership statistics portal, accessible from the Subjects module of our website, provides users with a single point of access to a wide variety of information on business performance and ownership in Canada. Next release Financial statistics for enterprises for the third quarter of 2021 will be released on November 23, 2021. Products Aggregate balance sheet and income statement data for Canadian corporations are now available. Data from the Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements are also available.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.7% on a year-over-year basis in July, up from a 3.1% gain in June. Excluding gasoline, the CPI increased 2.8% year over year. On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.6% in July, the fastest pace since January 2021. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI was up 0.5%. Chart 1 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding gasoline Highlights Prices rose at a faster pace year over year in six of the eight major components in July, with shelter prices contributing the most to the all-items increase. Conversely, prices for clothing and footwear as well as alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and recreational cannabis slowed on a year-over-year basis in July compared with June. Chart 2 Prices rise at a faster pace in six major components Gasoline prices rise at a slower pace Year over year, prices for gasoline rose less in July (+30.9%) than in June (+32.0%). A base-year effect continued to impact the gasoline index, as prices in July 2020 increased 4.4% on a month-over-month basis when many businesses and services reopened. In July 2021, gasoline prices increased 3.5% month over month, as oil production by OPEC+ (countries from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus) remained below pre-pandemic levels though global demand increased. Infographic 1 Gasoline prices rise at a slower pace in July Homeowners' replacement cost index rises at its fastest rate since 1987 The homeowners' replacement cost index, which is related to the price of new homes, continued to trend upward, rising 13.8% year over year in July, the largest yearly increase since October 1987. Similarly, the other owned accommodation expenses index, which includes commission fees on the sale of real estate, was up 13.4% year over year in July. Chart 3 Yearly price changes in the homeowners' replacement cost index Spotlight on food prices Given that food is a frequently purchased good, high prices are often the subject of discussion, as are great deals. The price of food is influenced by a number of factors. Weather, for example, is the most important variable for maintaining the supply of crops. As farmers weather the elements, prices will reflect a good harvest or the lower supply that comes with a poor harvest. This was experienced in 2019, when lower vegetable yields were partly attributable to an El Niño climate pattern. The COVID-19 pandemic has also influenced food prices in Canada. As restaurants closed for extended periods in some parts of the country, overall demand changed. Canadians consume different foods at restaurants than at home. For example, this shift led to a temporary over supply of potatoes for French fries early in the pandemic. Suppliers also had to adapt, in some cases shifting products destined for restaurants to grocery stores. In the Consumer Price Index (CPI), food is the second-most important component by basket weight, representing 16.24% of the 2020 CPI basket. The food component is broken down into two categories: food purchased from stores (11.74% of the basket) and food purchased from restaurants (4.50%). Overall food prices increased in July 2021 (+1.7%) compared with July 2020. Prices for food purchased from restaurants grew by 3.1%, the highest increase since January 2019, mainly driven by food purchased from fast food and take-out restaurants (+3.3%). Food purchased from stores (+1.0%) also rose in July. Canadians consume a variety of different foods, which can result in large price changes that offset each other at the aggregate level. For instance, prices for meat (+3.1%) and dairy products (+3.5%) increased on a year-over-year basis in July, while prices for fresh vegetables (-7.5%) and fresh fruit (-0.6%) fell during the same period. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor developments in food prices and the impact on consumer price inflation. Prices for durable goods increase at a faster pace Year-over-year price growth for goods rose at a faster pace in July (+5.0%) than in June (+4.5%), with durable goods (+5.0%) accelerating the most. The purchase of passenger vehicles index contributed the most to the increase, rising 5.5% year over year in July. The gain was partially attributable to the global shortage of semiconductor chips. Prices for upholstered furniture rose 13.4% year over year in July, largely as a result of lower supply and higher input costs. The introduction of tariffs on upholstered furniture, first implemented in early May 2021, may also have contributed to the increase. The video equipment index was up 4.8% year over year, mainly driven by higher prices for televisions. Chart 4 Prices for durable goods accelerate the most year over year Regional highlights Year over year, prices rose at a faster pace in July than in June in every province. Chart 5 The Consumer Price Index rises at a faster pace in all provinces Consumers in Alberta pay more for electricity The price of electricity in Alberta rose 25.1% on a month-over-month basis, the largest monthly increase since July 2015. The movement is largely attributable to an increase in demand amid high summer temperatures in the province. Traveller accommodation prices increase the most in Newfoundland and Labrador The traveller accommodation index rose 7.4% year over year in July, after falling 3.1% the previous month. Prices in Newfoundland and Labrador (+14.8%) increased the most, as the province lifted its non-essential travel ban that had been in place for nearly 14 months. Consumers in Quebec (+10.3%) and British Columbia (+10.0%) also paid more for traveller accommodations in July.

The following sub-indexes were imputed from the monthly change in the all-items index: travel tours, components of spectator entertainment, recreational services, and some components of use of recreational facilities and services in some areas. Air transportation received the same treatments as in June. The details of the treatments from April 2020 to March 2021 are provided in technical supplements available through the Prices Analytical Series. Details and other treatment information for April 2021 to July 2021 are available upon request. As COVID-19 restrictions ease throughout the country, products and services that were unavailable for consumption in previous months will start to become available. Statistics Canada continues to monitor the impacted sectors and will remove these special treatments and reintroduce monthly pricing as the goods and services become widely available for consumption.

All provinces except British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador posted lower values, with the majority of the national decline reported in Alberta (-23.4%). Building permits fell 3.1% in the residential sector and 5.6% in the non-residential sector. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits fell 3.8% to $7.0 billion. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, July 2021 Ontario weighs down residential permits nationally Seven provinces reported declines in the residential sector, led by Ontario (-10.5%). Single-family permits fell 9.6% in July, with two provinces showing growth. Ontario (-9.1%) contributed the most to the decrease. Construction intentions for multi-family units rose 2.7% in July. British Columbia posted an increase of 55.1%, which was driven by high-valued condo projects in the city of Surrey. In contrast, Ontario reversed strong growth in June (+67.6%) and fell 11.7% in July due to fewer high-valued condo permits reported for the census metropolitan areas (CMA) of Hamilton and Guelph. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Non-residential permits down in July Non-residential permit values declined 5.6% to $2.9 billion in July, despite Ontario's strong growth of 17.3%. Seven provinces were down, with Alberta reporting the largest decrease (-46.9%). Institutional permits decreased for a third consecutive month to $718 million, with eight provinces reporting lower values. The majority of the decline stemmed from Quebec (-36.8%), following a strong June (+40.0%) when multiple high-valued permits were issued for alternative care and senior homes. Conversely, Ontario saw a 60.0% increase, with projects such as the Linhaven nursing home and a new secondary school both in the CMA of St. Catharines–Niagara. Alberta's commercial permits fell 45.5% in July, following a notable increase in June (+56.6%). The decline in Alberta and in six other provinces pulled the value of commercial permits at the national level down 6.9% to $1.6 billion. The value of industrial permits was up 17.6% to $612 million, with half the provinces reporting growth. Quebec (+59.5%) led the increase, with a $30 million warehouse permit, and was followed by Nova Scotia (+412.3%), where a $40 million composting facility permit was issued.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates are available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (e.g., single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (e.g., apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for August will be released on October 4, 2021.

Terms of trade 106.3 (2012=100) Second quarter 2021 Source(s): Table 36-10-0105-01. Substantial declines in home resale activities and exports pushed real gross domestic product (GDP) down 0.3% in the second quarter of 2021. This contrasted with three consecutive quarterly increases that followed the sharp decline (-11.3%) caused by pandemic-related business shutdowns and travel restrictions in the second quarter of 2020. Increases in investment in business inventories, government final consumption expenditures, business investment in machinery and equipment, and investment in new home construction and renovation were not sufficient to offset the declines in exports (-4.0%) and home ownership transfer costs (-17.7%), which include all costs associated with the transfer of a residential asset from one owner to another. Imports were flat in the second quarter. Real gross national income rose 1.5%, reflecting gains from higher prices of exported crude oil and crude bitumen. Final domestic demand edged up 0.2%, following the 1.6% rise in the first quarter. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product and final domestic demand Chart 2 Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product, second quarter of 2021 Businesses accumulated $9.7 billion in inventories, compared with a $6.2 billion withdrawal in the first quarter. The inventory accumulation, which was the major contributor to GDP during the quarter, was led by durable retail goods. Housing investment reshapes the economy Since the third quarter of 2020, housing investment has emerged as the predominant contributor to economic activities and to capital stock—with residential capital stock surpassing non-residential capital stock. Moreover, the average housing investment for the previous four quarters was 17% higher than the average over the last five years. Chart 3 Housing investment Both new construction and renovations—the components of residential capital stock—have shown sustained growth since the third quarter of 2020. Because of the ability to work from home, savings from less travel and reduced participation in other activities, low mortgage rates and increases in home equity lines of credit, spending has continued to increase on new houses (+3.2%) and home renovations (+2.4%). After taking on $62.3 billion of residential mortgage debt in the last half of 2020, households added $84.2 billion more residential housing debt in the first half of 2021. Household spending flat Household spending, which rose 0.7% in the first quarter, edged up 0.1% in the second quarter. This reflected a drop in spending on goods—32 out of 48 categories of goods experienced decreases. Chart 4 Household final consumption of durable goods and services Outlays for durable goods declined in the quarter, as higher prices for many products constrained demand. With the easing of pandemic restrictions, outlays for services increased (+1.8%), led by food and beverage services (+4.3%). Business investment in machinery and equipment rebounds Business investment in machinery and equipment rose 5.7%, reflecting a sharp increase in investment in aircraft and other transportation equipment. This followed a sharp decline in the first quarter owing to a large disinvestment of used aircraft. Industrial machinery and equipment investment rose 4.8%, stemming from substantial imports. Supply chain disruptions continue to impact motor vehicles Shortages of microchips and other inputs curtailed trade in motor vehicles and domestic consumption. Household purchases of new passenger cars (-7.2%) and trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles (-1.6%) decreased, while business investment in medium and heavy trucks, buses and other motor vehicles fell 34.2%. Longer plant shutdowns because of international supply chain disruptions have constrained imports of parts and led to significant decreases in exports. Low production of motor vehicles and parts resulted in an 18.9% drop in exports of passenger cars and light trucks and an 8.7% decline in tires, motor vehicle engines and parts exports. Inventories had another quarter of significant drawdowns in response to supply needs. Continued rises in prices and nominal gross domestic product The GDP implicit price index, which reflects the overall price of domestically produced goods and services, rose 2.2% in the second quarter, driven by prices of construction materials and energy. This growth followed a 3.0% increase in the first quarter. Consequently, nominal GDP increased 1.9%. Led by professional and personal services, construction, trade, and health and mining industries, compensation of employees rose 1.4%, reflecting heightened activity as lockdowns eased. Quebec (+2.8%), Alberta (+2.8%), and British Columbia (+1.5%) led the national wage increases in the second quarter. Terms-of-trade improves and real gross national income rises The terms-of-trade—that is, the ratio of the price of exports to the price of imports—was up 4.2%. This increase was led by a 4.9% increase in export prices, primarily a 17.7% increase in the price of exported crude oil and crude bitumen. Increased terms-of-trade contributed to higher real gross national income (+1.5%), which captures the real purchasing power of income earned by Canadian-owned production factors. Double-digit household savings rate continues The modest rise in household spending (+0.7%, in nominal terms) was outpaced by growth in disposable income (+2.2%) leaving households with more net savings than in the previous quarter. Household incomes were primarily bolstered by rising compensation of employees along with increasing transfers received from government, which were partially offset by a 2.8% rise in personal income taxes. Consequently, the savings rate reached 14.2%—the fifth consecutive quarter with a double-digit savings rate—as various pandemic-related restrictions and uncertainty continued to limit the scope of household consumption. The household savings rate is aggregated across all income brackets; in general, savings rates are greater in higher income brackets.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. Data on gross domestic product, income and expenditure are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Revisions Data on gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2021 have been released along with the revised data of the first quarter of 2021. Support measures by governments To alleviate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented a number of programs, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. For a comprehensive explanation of how government support measures were treated in the compilation of the estimates, see ""Recording COVID-19 measures in the national accounts"" and ""Recording new COVID measures in the national accounts."" Details of some of the more significant government measures can be found on the page Federal government expenditures on COVID-19 response measures. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Percentage change Percentage changes for expenditure-based statistics (such as household spending, investment and exports) are calculated from volume measures that are adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-based statistics (such as compensation of employees and operating surplus) are calculated from nominal values, that is, they are not adjusted for price variations. Unless otherwise stated, growth rates represent the percentage change in the series from one quarter to the next; for instance, from the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021. Real-time tables Real-time tables 36-10-0430-01 and 36-10-0431-01 will be updated on September 7.

Total economic activity was about 2% below the level in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. From July to early August 2021, Statistics Canada conducted the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. This survey collects information on business expectations in the future and the ongoing impact of the pandemic on businesses in Canada. Over the next three months (see Note to readers), over one-quarter of businesses expected their profitability to decrease, 14.8% expected their sales to decrease, over one-fifth expected to increase the prices they charge and nearly four-fifths expected their number of employees to remain the same. Businesses also expected to face a variety of obstacles in the short term. Businesses have a mixed view on profitability and sales in the short term, depending on the industry Over one-quarter (27.2%) of all businesses expected their profitability to decrease over the next three months (see Note to readers), while 13.7% of businesses expected their profitability to increase. Close to three-fifths (56.5%) of businesses expected profitability to remain relatively unchanged. Expectations of future profitability differ by industry. For example, among businesses in accommodation and food services, while nearly two-fifths expected profitability to decrease (39.3%) or remain about the same (38.0%), over one-fifth (22.4%) expected profitability to increase. In addition, over one-third of businesses in transportation and warehousing (35.7%) and in administrative and support, waste management and remediation services (35.1%) expected their profitability to decrease over the next three months. Conversely, more than one-fifth of businesses in retail trade (20.9%) and nearly one-fifth of businesses in wholesale trade (19.3%) expected profitability to increase. Over one-fifth (21.7%) of businesses expected to raise prices over the next three months, just over the 19.9% of businesses that expected to in the second quarter. Those in wholesale trade (38.7%), manufacturing (36.4%), and accommodation and food services (34.5%) were most likely to expect to raise prices. Close to four-fifths (78.2%) of businesses expected to retain the same number of employees over the next three months, similar to the 77.6% that expected to do so in the second quarter. Conversely, 7.1% of businesses expected their number of employees to decrease, down from 8.8% in the previous quarter. In accommodation and food services, 16.0% of businesses expected a decline in their number of employees over the next three months, down from the previous quarter (20.5%). In terms of vacant positions, 8.3% of businesses expected to have more job vacancies over the next three months. However, in accommodation and food services, nearly one-fifth (18.6%) of businesses expected to have more vacant positions, up from 13.4% in the previous quarter. Business survival and plans over the next year Over half (53.9%) of businesses reported that they could continue operating at their current level of revenue and expenditures for 12 months or more before considering closure or bankruptcy, compared with over two-thirds (68.5%) of businesses that reported the same in the second quarter. Similar to the second quarter, 6.8% of businesses reported that they could continue for less than 12 months. Less than one-fifth of businesses in accommodation and food services (16.9%) reported that they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before having to consider closure or bankruptcy, down from the previous quarter (22.8%). Almost half (49.4%) of businesses reported that they could continue to operate at their current level of revenue and expenditures for 12 months or more before considering laying off staff, down from the over three-fifths (61.6%) of businesses that reported the same in the second quarter. Meanwhile, more than one in six businesses (17.7%) reported that they could continue for less than 12 months before considering laying off staff. Businesses in accommodation and food services (34.5%), in arts, entertainment and recreation (33.7%), and in manufacturing (24.3%) were most likely to report that they could continue operating at their current level of revenue and expenditures for less than 12 months before considering laying off staff. Moreover, one in eight businesses (12.9%) had plans to expand or restructure or to acquire or invest in other businesses in the next year. Similar to the second quarter, 3.2% of businesses had plans to transfer or sell their business in the next year. Meanwhile, 1.6% of businesses had plans to close their business, relatively unchanged from the 1.3% of businesses in the second quarter. Nearly four-fifths (79.3%) of businesses had the cash or liquid assets required to operate over the next three months. Nearly one-fifth (19.0%) of businesses reported that they could not take on more debt. Of businesses that could not take on more debt, the most commonly reported reasons were a lack of confidence or uncertainty in future sales (41.0%), cash flow (39.6%), and that the request would be turned down (15.9%). Businesses expect to face a variety of obstacles, including labour shortages and supply issues Businesses face a variety of obstacles and future unknowns. The rising cost of inputs, including labour, capital, energy and raw materials, was the most commonly expected obstacle over the next three months (38.5%). This proportion was similar to the 37.8% of businesses that expected this to be an obstacle in the second quarter. The rising cost of inputs was expected to be an obstacle for approximately three in five businesses in manufacturing (65.4%); accommodation and food services (59.6%); and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (58.0%). Businesses also expected to face obstacles related to the workforce. Recruiting skilled employees was expected to be an obstacle for over one-third (34.6%) of all businesses, led by those in accommodation and food services (55.3%), manufacturing (46.9%), and construction (41.1%). In addition, a labour force shortage was expected to be an obstacle for 30.3% of businesses, while retaining skilled employees was expected to be an obstacle for nearly one-quarter (24.5%) of businesses. Over one-quarter (25.3%) of businesses expected the cost of insurance to be an obstacle over the next three months. This was expected by over two-fifths of businesses in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (41.6%) and in mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (41.0%). Over one-fifth (22.6%) of businesses expected fluctuations in consumer demand to be an obstacle over the next three months. This was expected by around one-third of businesses in arts, entertainment and recreation (33.8%); retail trade (33.1%); and accommodation and food services (32.6%). Half (50.1%) of businesses in construction and over two-fifths (41.9%) of businesses in manufacturing expected to have difficulty acquiring inputs, products or supplies domestically over the next three months. Over one-third of businesses in wholesale trade (36.1%) and manufacturing (34.4%) expected to have difficulty acquiring inputs, products or supplies from abroad. Businesses outsourcing tasks, projects and short contracts Over one-fifth (21.4%) of all businesses had outsourced tasks, projects or short contracts to freelancers, gig workers, or other businesses or organizations in the previous 12 months. Businesses in information and cultural industries (35.5%) were the most likely to have done this. Of the businesses that outsourced tasks, projects or short contracts, over one-quarter (26.3%) used a third-party digital platform, application or website to do so. The activities most commonly outsourced through a third-party digital platform were website or software development and computer programming (51.6%); accounting, law or other professional services (39.1%); graphic design and audio-visual production (38.3%); and sales and marketing support (32.7%). Businesses anticipate reducing office space as more workers expected to telework Over one-quarter (27.8%) of businesses anticipated that some of their workforce would continue to primarily telework once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. The businesses most likely to anticipate having some of their staff primarily telework were those in information and cultural industries (53.4%); professional, scientific and technical services (51.5%); and finance and insurance (44.8%). Of the businesses anticipating staff to telework, almost one in six (14.7%) foresaw reducing their office space because more of their workforce would be teleworking. Non-profit organizations Nearly four-fifths (77.8%) of non-profit organizations expected to retain the same number of employees over the next three months, while 14.5% expected to increase their number of employees. Three-fifths (60.5%) of non-profit organizations expected their operating income to stay about the same over the next three months, while 15.7% expected their operating income to increase. Nearly three-fifths (58.8%) of non-profit organizations expected their operating expenses to stay about the same, while nearly one-quarter (24.8%) expected operating expenses to increase over the next three months. The most common obstacles non-profit organizations expected to face over the next three months were recruiting skilled employees (35.4%) and retaining skilled employees (25.3%). Nevertheless, the majority of non-profit organizations (89.7%) were optimistic about the future outlook for their organization over the next 12 months. Table 1 Expected obstacles to businesses or organizations over the next three months, by selected industry, third quarter of 2021 Note to readers Data from the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions are now available. The tables provide data at the national, provincial and territorial levels by industrial sector, employment size, type of business and majority ownership. Data are also available for the 20 largest cities in Canada, by request. Data in this release are from Statistics Canada's Canadian Survey on Business Conditions. Results from this survey are applicable to all employer businesses in Canada. This survey is carried out on a quarterly basis to collect information from businesses in Canada more efficiently and rapidly, compared with traditional survey methods. The most recent survey was conducted from July 2 to August 6, 2021, and respondents were asked about their expectations over the next three-month period. As a result, those three months could range from July 2 to November 6, 2021, depending on when the business responded. This survey collected data from businesses on the current economic situation and will be used to effectively assess their needs for support measures both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistics Canada would like to thank all the Canadians who took the time to answer questions for this survey. Their collaboration enables a better understanding of COVID-19's impact on Canadian businesses and the economy.

Payroll employment rose by 214,800 (+1.3%) in June, driven by increases in the services-producing sector in Ontario and Quebec. At the same time, average weekly earnings fell, as job gains were concentrated in lower-paying industries. In June, public health measures implemented against the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly eased. As a result, indoor and outdoor dining, recreation and cultural activities, retail shopping, and personal care services resumed or continued in most areas of the country, with varying degrees of capacity restrictions. In Ontario, personal care services partially resumed at the end of the month; however, indoor dining and gyms remained closed. Services-producing sector drives payroll employment increase in June with the easing of public health measures There were 214,800 (+1.3%) more employees receiving pay or benefits from their employer in June—measured in the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) as payroll employment—the strongest monthly growth since March 2021. The June Labour Force Survey (LFS) reported 230,700 (+1.2%) more people employed (including self-employed). The increases in both the SEPH and the LFS were driven by the services-producing sector, as the easing of public health measures allowed many businesses in accommodation and food services and in retail trade to reopen. Payroll employment rose in six provinces in June. Ontario (+95,500; +1.6%) and Quebec (+79,200; +2.1%) accounted for most of the increase. Compared with February 2020, payroll employment in Canada was down by 769,900 (-4.5%) in June. Chart 1 Payroll employment increases in June Accommodation and food services and retail trade account for half of the June payroll employment increase Just over half of the June payroll employment increase was in accommodation and food services (+77,400; +8.7%) and retail trade (+35,300; +1.9%), two sectors where employment has been most susceptible to changes in public health measures throughout the pandemic. Most of the June employment increase in these two sectors occurred in Ontario and Quebec, consistent with the loosening of public health measures in these provinces following the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all of the gain in payroll employment in accommodation and food services occurred in the food services and drinking places subsector. In retail trade, payroll employment rose in 10 of the 12 subsectors, with the largest increases in clothing and clothing accessories stores and general merchandise stores. In June, payroll employment was 28.2% below the pre-COVID-19 level in accommodation and food services, while it was 3.7% below in retail trade. Payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services continues upward trend Payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services has been on an upward trend since June 2020 and continued to rise in June 2021, increasing by 16,800 (+1.6%). This increase was spread across all industries, led by accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and payroll services (+5,300; +4.3%), and architectural, engineering and related services (+3,700; +1.8%). A large share (84%) of jobs in this sector can potentially be performed from home, according to a previous Statistics Canada analysis, limiting the impact of public health measures on employment in the sector. Most of the employment growth in the sector occurred in Ontario (+7,500; +1.7%) and Quebec (+4,400; +1.8%). In June, payroll employment in professional, scientific and technical services was 5.8% above the February 2020 level. Employment in scientific research and development services was the furthest above its pre-pandemic level (+11.8%), followed by computer systems design and related services (+11.4%), while employment in advertising, public relations, and related services was the furthest below (-7.1%). Compared with February 2020, average weekly earnings in professional, scientific and technical services were up 4.1% to $1,523. Average weekly earnings decrease in June as job gains are concentrated in lower-paying industries Average weekly earnings decreased 1.0% to $1,125 from May to June, partly because the employment gains were concentrated in lower-paying sectors. The largest employment gains in June were in the two sectors with the lowest average weekly earnings: accommodation and food services ($457 per week) and retail trade ($643 per week). While average weekly earnings were down in June compared with May, they were 7.6% higher than in February 2020. This increase reflects a number of factors, including changes in the composition of employment by type of employee (hourly or salaried) and changes in the overall employment distribution by sector. At the onset of the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown, job losses were largest in some of the lower-paying sectors. These sectors have also remained furthest from their pre-pandemic employment levels. In June 2021, payroll employment in arts, entertainment and recreation, where average earnings were $729 per week, was 38.8% below its February 2020 level. In accommodation and food services ($457 per week), employment was 28.2% below its pre-COVID-19 level. In contrast, two of the sectors with the highest average weekly earnings had surpassed their pre-pandemic employment levels. Employment in professional, scientific and technical services ($1,523 per week) was 5.8% higher in June 2021 compared with February 2020, and employment in finance and insurance ($1,453 per week) was 1.6% higher. The disproportionate loss of employment in lower-paying sectors has the effect of increasing overall average earnings. Chart 2 Payroll employment remains furthest from pre-COVID-19 levels in lower-paying sectors Within each sector, changes in average weekly earnings are also influenced by factors, such as the share of employment by different occupation and job tenure. In the July LFS, a fixed-weighted index was used to control for these compositional changes. The results showed that while overall average hourly wages in June 2021 were 7.0% higher than the 2019 average, this was reduced to a 5.2% increase when controlling for occupation and tenure. Average hours worked decrease for hourly employees Hourly paid employees worked an average of 31.2 hours in June, down 1.3% from May. Average hours worked per week for salaried employees were 37.1, little changed from the previous month. Job vacancies in accommodation and food services drive vacancy rate to new high in June Canadian employers were actively recruiting for an estimated 815,800 positions in June 2021, as public health measures related to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly eased. While monthly and quarterly Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) statistics are not directly comparable, quarterly JVWS estimates show that prior to the pandemic, second-quarter job vacancies reached 581,600 in 2019 (data from the JVWS are unadjusted for seasonality). The job vacancy rate, which measures vacant positions as a proportion of all positions (vacant and occupied), reached 5.0% in June. This was the highest job vacancy rate since monthly job vacancy estimates became available in October 2020. The large majority of June vacancies—8 in 10—were in the services-producing sector. The number of job vacancies in accommodation and food services (129,100) surpassed that in health care and social assistance (109,300), which had previously led all sectors since November 2020. Retail trade (94,300) had the third-highest number of job vacancies. Among all sectors, the job vacancy rate was highest in accommodation and food services (12.7%) in June, as the number of job vacancies reached a record high. With public health restrictions affecting this sector beginning to ease, outdoor dining resumed in late May or early June in many regions, and employers were actively recruiting to fill vacant positions. British Columbia (6.0%) and Quebec (5.8%) had the highest job vacancy rates among the provinces in June. Job vacancy rates were lowest in Manitoba (3.7%) and Nova Scotia (3.8%). Quarterly JVWS estimates provide more detailed information on job vacancies such as the type of work, occupation and average offered hourly wage. Estimates for the second quarter of 2021 will be released on September 21. Looking ahead: Further loosening and lifting of public health measures In July, public health measures were further loosened or lifted in Alberta, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. July SEPH data—to be released on September 28—will provide detailed information on sectors and subsectors that may have benefited from this further loosening of public health measures. Table 1 Average weekly earnings (including overtime) for all employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Number of employees – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Job vacancies and job vacancy rate, unadjusted for seasonality Sustainable development goals On January 1, 2016, the world officially began implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—the United Nations' transformative plan of action that addresses urgent global challenges over the following 15 years. The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours is an example of how Statistics Canada supports reporting on the global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours The key objective of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) is to provide a monthly portrait of the level of earnings, employment and hours worked, by detailed industry, at the national, provincial and territorial levels. Payroll employment, as measured by the SEPH, refers to the number of employees receiving pay or benefits (employment income) during a given month. The survey excludes the self-employed, owners and partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, and employees in the agricultural sector. SEPH estimates are produced by integrating information from three sources: a census of approximately 1 million payroll deduction records provided by the Canada Revenue Agency; the Business Payrolls Survey, which collects data from a sample of 15,000 establishments; and administrative records of federal, provincial and territorial public administration employment, provided by these levels of government. Estimates of average weekly earnings and hours worked are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. Payroll employment estimates are based on a census of administrative records and are not subject to sampling variability. With each release of SEPH data, data for the preceding month are revised. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. Statistics Canada also produces employment estimates from its Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS is a monthly household survey, the main objective of which is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive groups: the employed (including the self-employed), the unemployed and those not in the labour force. This survey is the official source for the unemployment rate, and it collects data on the sociodemographic characteristics of all those in the labour market. As a result of conceptual and methodological differences, estimates of changes from the SEPH and the LFS differ occasionally. However, the trends in the data are similar. For a more in-depth discussion of the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and the SEPH, refer to Section 8 of the Guide to the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (Catalogue number72-203-G). Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data, which facilitate comparisons because the effects of seasonal variations are removed. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Non-farm payroll employment data are for all hourly and salaried employees and for the ""other employees"" category, which includes piece-rate and commission-only employees. Unless otherwise specified, average weekly hours data are for hourly and salaried employees only and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. All earnings data include overtime and exclude businesses that could not be classified to a NAICS code. Earnings data are based on gross taxable payroll before source deductions. Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total weekly earnings by the number of employees. Job Vacancy and Wage Survey Beginning with the release of October 2020 data, preliminary monthly estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are published on a monthly basis. These estimates provide more timely information on the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate by province and by industrial sector. JVWS collection is done on a quarterly basis. The quarterly sample of business locations is allocated to the three collection months of the quarter, approximately balanced by province and by industrial sector across each of the three months. This allows both quarterly and monthly estimates to be produced. The JVWS also provides comprehensive quarterly data on job vacancies by industrial sector and detailed occupation for Canada and the provinces, territories and economic regions; offered hourly wages; and job vacancy characteristics. Quarterly data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable because survey operations were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the concepts and use of data from the JVWS is available in the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (Catalogue number75-514-G). Preliminary monthly estimates are produced for job vacancies, job vacancy rates and payroll employment using available responses from business locations sampled in the corresponding reference month. The reference period for the JVWS is the first day of the respective month. These preliminary monthly estimates are revised and finalized when the corresponding quarterly estimates are released or shortly thereafter. Users are encouraged to use the most up-to-date data available for each month. JVWS estimates are not seasonally adjusted. Therefore, month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should be interpreted with caution as they may reflect seasonal movements. While JVWS employment is calibrated to the SEPH, SEPH payroll employment and JVWS preliminary monthly employment figures may differ because of calibration grouping and differences in scope and reference period. Real-time data tables Real-time data tables 14-10-0357-01, 14-10-0358-01, 14-10-0331-01 and 14-10-0332-01 will be updated on September 13. Next release Data on payroll employment, earnings and hours, and job vacancies for July will be released on September 28.

Research shows that the majority of crimes are not reported to police; therefore, data collected through surveys on self-reported victimization help provide a more complete picture of the nature and prevalence of crime. Results from the 2019 GSS are being released today in the Juristat article ""Criminal victimization in Canada, 2019."" Analysis focuses on the prevalence of victimization, the characteristics of victims and incidents, and the impacts and consequences of victimization. In addition, levels of reporting to police and factors associated with the decision to report victimization to police are examined. Data collection for the 2019 GSS ended in March 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was beginning to take hold and drastically change the daily lives of everyone living in Canada. Though the data do not reflect the circumstances of the pandemic, they do present important baseline information on the patterns, impacts and consequences of victimization just prior to the pandemic. Almost 6 million Canadians reported that they or their household had been affected by crime in 2019 One in five Canadians—19%, or nearly 6 million people 15 years and older—reported that they or their household had experienced at least one of the crimes measured by the GSS in 2019. In total, there were more than 8 million incidents of criminal victimization, including sexual assault, robbery, physical assault, break and enter, theft of motor vehicles or parts, theft of household or personal property, and vandalism. Because of changes in collection methods for the GSS on Victimization, most notably the introduction of an online questionnaire to provide another way for Canadians to participate, comparisons with previous cycles are not recommended (see Note to readers). The majority of these self-reported incidents—almost 7 in 10 (69%)—were non-violent in nature. Theft of personal property was the most common type of crime, accounting for more than one-third (37%) of all incidents. Chart 1 Self-reported victimization, by type of victimization, Canada, 2019 More than 4 in 10 (42%) of those who were victimized personally or whose household was victimized experienced multiple incidents of crime. In all, there were just over 2.6 million incidents of self-reported violent victimization (sexual assault, robbery and physical assault) in Canada in 2019. Expressed as a rate, there were 83 incidents of violent crime for every 1,000 Canadians 15 years and older. Physical assault was most common (46 incidents per 1,000 population), followed by sexual assault (30) and robbery (7). This is similar to police-reported data, which also show that physical assault is the most common type of violent crime and that sexual assault is more common than robbery. Compared with the overall population, young people, women and sexual minorities are at higher risk of experiencing violence Certain population groups were disproportionately impacted by violent victimization, according to the 2019 GSS. For example, young Canadians were more at risk of being a victim of a violent crime, with victimization rates highest among those aged 15 to 24 (176 incidents per 1,000 population) and those aged 25 to 34 (135 per 1,000). Rates declined with age, dropping to 20 incidents per 1,000 population among those aged 65 and older. The rate of self-reported violent victimization was nearly twice as high among women (106 incidents per 1,000 women) than among men (59 incidents per 1,000 men) in 2019. This difference was driven by sexual assault, the rate of which was more than five times higher among women (50 per 1,000) than men (9 per 1,000). Chart 2 Self-reported violent victimization, by gender of victim and type of victimization, Canada, 2019 In 2019, the violent victimization rate among bisexual Canadians was 655 incidents per 1,000 population, over nine times higher than that among heterosexual Canadians (70 per 1,000). There were no statistically significant differences in victimization rates between heterosexual Canadians and those who are lesbian or gay. After other factors were controlled for, age, gender and sexual orientation all remained significantly associated with the likelihood of being victimized. Young people, women and people who reported a minority sexual identity were more at risk. Rates of violent victimization higher among Indigenous people and people with a disability Rates of violent victimization were almost three times higher among people with a disability (141 incidents per 1,000) than among those with no disability (53 per 1,000). In particular, women with a disability were more likely to be victimized, with 184 violent incidents for every 1,000 women with a disability, compared with 84 per 1,000 men with a disability. The overall violent victimization rate among people designated as belonging to a visible minority group did not differ significantly from the rate for non–visible minorities. Relative to the overall visible minority population, rates were similar among Filipino people, while those who identified as Chinese recorded lower violent victimization rates. Because of the sample size, more detailed disaggregation of victimization rates among diverse populations is not possible. In 2019, the rate of violent victimization among Indigenous people (First Nations, Métis or Inuit) (177 per 1,000) was more than double that among non-Indigenous people (80 per 1,000). In particular, Métis (225 per 1,000) and Inuit (265 per 1,000; use with caution) had higher rates; the violent victimization rate among First Nations people was not statistically different from that among non-Indigenous people. A multitude of factors impact victimization rates, and differing victimization rates among certain populations may be related to variations in the prevalence of other risk factors among these groups. For example, childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for future victimization, and, based on the GSS on Victimization, Indigenous people experienced higher rates of physical and sexual abuse during childhood. The physical and sexual abuse of Indigenous children is a well-documented aspect of the historical and ongoing trauma and violence brought on by colonization, residential schools and the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the child welfare system. Childhood experiences of abuse, harsh parenting, neglect and witnessing violence are associated with higher rates of violent victimization Research to date has found that adverse childhood experiences, such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, harsh parenting or neglect, and exposure to violence in the home, have all been linked to subsequent experiences of victimization in adulthood. Results from the 2019 GSS provide further support for these links. Violent victimization rates were three to four times higher among people who were physically abused, sexually abused, experienced harsh parenting, and were exposed to violence in the home before the age of 15, compared with those who did not have these experiences. Further information on child maltreatment is presented in the infographic ""Childhood maltreatment and the link with victimization in adulthood: Findings from the 2019 General Social Survey,"" also available today. Most criminal incidents are not reported to police In 2019, most incidents of victimization were not reported to police, with about 3 in 10 (29%) coming to the attention of police. On the whole, incidents of household victimization were more likely than violent incidents to have been brought to the attention of police (35% versus 24%). One reason for this could be related to requirements set out by insurance companies for claims for stolen or damaged property, which was a reason cited by 45% of people who reported an incident of household crime to police. Of all crimes measured by the GSS, sexual assault had the lowest rate of reporting to police, with 6% of incidents in 2019 having come to the attention of police. This figure is consistent with results from other self-reported surveys conducted both before and after the #MeToo movement. Victims of violent crime may choose to report—or not report—an incident to police for a wide range of reasons. In 2019, about half of all victims of violent crime who did not report the incident to police did not report it because they felt that the crime was too minor (56%), the incident was not important enough (53%), they did not want the hassle of dealing with police (49%), the incident was private or personal (48%), or they felt no one was harmed (47%). Note to readers This Juristat article is based on results from the 2019 General Social Survey (GSS) on Canadians' Safety (Victimization). The main objective of the GSS on Victimization is to better understand issues related to the safety and security of Canadians, including perceptions of crime and the justice system, experiences of intimate partner violence, and how safe people feel in their communities. The GSS on Victimization asked Canadians about their experiences with eight types of offences: Violent victimization: Sexual assault, robbery or physical assault. Sexual assault: Forced sexual activity; attempted forced sexual activity; unwanted sexual touching, grabbing, kissing or fondling; or sexual relations without being able to give consent. Robbery: Theft or attempted theft in which the offender had a weapon or there was violence or the threat of violence against the victim. Physical assault: An attack (victim hit, slapped, grabbed, knocked down or beaten), a face-to-face threat of physical harm, or an incident with a weapon present. Theft of personal property: Theft or attempted theft of personal property such as money, credit cards, clothing, jewellery, a purse or a wallet. Unlike robbery, the offender does not confront the victim. Household victimization: Break and enter, theft of motor vehicles or parts, theft of household property, or vandalism. Break and enter: Illegal entry or attempted entry into a residence or other building on the victim's property. Theft of motor vehicle or parts: Theft or attempted theft of a car, truck, van, motorcycle, moped or other vehicle, or part of a motor vehicle. Theft of household property: Theft or attempted theft of household property such as liquor, bicycles, electronic equipment, tools or appliances. Vandalism: Wilful damage of personal or household property. To modernize collection activities and give Canadians another means through which they could participate in the survey, the GSS included the option to respond to the survey online in 2019. Any significant change in survey methodology can affect the comparability of the data over time. It is impossible to determine with certainty whether, and to what extent, differences in a variable are attributable to an actual change in the population and the behaviours being examined or to changes in the survey methodology between the collection cycles. Consequently, comparisons of 2019 GSS results with results of previous GSS cycles conducted without the use of online questionnaires are not recommended, as any differences may be the result of a change in collection method rather than reflect actual changes in victimization patterns. Methodological analysis shows that the data are of good quality and present an accurate picture of criminal victimization in Canada in 2019.

The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was experienced in Canada early during the second quarter of 2021. In April, the number of positive COVID-19 cases grew to its highest levels since January 2021. Consequently, provinces enacted public health measures in several regions across the country which directly affected the performance of businesses in Canada. Input costs for Canadian businesses grew 6.1% on average over the second quarter, higher than the 5.7% increase seen in the first quarter. While an increase in the price of lumber drove the rise, input costs rose across most product lines, which drove up the costs of goods sold for Canadian producers. Consequently, net income before taxes in the non-financial sector declined by 2.0% in the quarter. During the quarter, a worldwide shortage of semiconductor chips strongly contributed to the 1.0% decrease in net income before tax in the motor vehicles and trailer manufacturing industry. The shortage also caused a decline in exports of motor vehicles and parts due to partial shutdowns during the period. Property and casualty insurers in Canada report an increase in claims over the quarter The property and casualty insurance industry reported an increase in the number of claims compared with the previous period. Later in June, a number of weather-related events damaged crops. Moreover, dry conditions prompted wildfires which may negatively impact the earnings of property and casualty insurance carriers in the next quarter. Life, health and medical insurers in Canada saw an increase of 15.0% in net income before tax, supported by favourable foreign exchange rates during the period. Over the second quarter, the Canadian dollar appreciated 181 basis points against the US dollar reaching its highest level since 2014. Life insurance reported a slight decrease in claims, further buoying results. The net income before taxes for wood and paper manufacturing edged up over the quarter In the wood product and paper industry, lumber prices continued to climb for the first half of the quarter. In May 2021, lumber prices were 123.3% higher year over year. However, prices for forestry products began to fall in the following month. Nonetheless, the industry saw an increase in net income before taxes by 1.5% over the quarter. A dispute over the Line 5 pipeline prompted worries over crude supply Over the quarter, oil and gas extraction and support services reported a net income before taxes of $1.4 billion, driven by an increase in the price of crude oil. Simultaneously, a dispute between the State of Michigan and Enbridge prompted fears over a major interruption in crude supply through the Line 5 pipeline, leading to a decline in oil prices, before quickly recovering. A shutdown of the pipeline would mean that crude oil would be transported via rail to eastern Canada or stored in available terminals. Furthermore, interrupted operation of Line 5 would mean that active crude refineries in eastern Canada would face supply shortages. The effects of these events may be reflected in future quarters as the dispute is resolved in the courts. Chart 1 Corporate net income before taxes (seasonally adjusted) Dashboard now available The Quarterly Survey of Financial Statistics: Visualization Tool is a comprehensive analytical tool that presents quarterly changes in the financial performance of enterprises. Note to readers Data from the Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements (QSFS) include amounts from government programs that support businesses, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. These amounts are considered to be revenue for these businesses. However, given lower response rates than historical averages, a potential delay in the release of this information by businesses and the methodology used to calculate QSFS estimates, use of these government support programs may be underestimated in the published data. Data on quarterly net income before taxes in this release are seasonally adjusted and expressed in current dollars, unless otherwise stated. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Quarterly financial statistics for enterprises are based on a sample survey and represent the activities of all corporations in Canada, except those that are government-controlled or not for profit. The survey collects data on balance sheets, income statements and additional disclosures of enterprises. An enterprise can be a single corporation or a family of corporations under common ownership or control, for which consolidated financial statements are produced. Survey changes The following changes were introduced to the survey starting with the first quarter of 2020: New content was implemented in the first quarter to align the survey with new accounting standards adopted by corporations starting in 2011. New industrial breakdowns were implemented, allowing for more granularity in the dissemination of data. As a result, some industry groupings were merged, others were split, and some remained the same. The survey sample was modified to support the new industrial breakdowns. However, a maximum sample overlap with the previous sample was adopted. A more automated imputation strategy was implemented to streamline the process and reduce the need for manual intervention. Revisions, benchmarking and backcasting The release of the QSFS in the second quarter of 2021 includes revised estimates for the first quarter of 2021. Efforts are being made to backcast these data to the first quarter of 2010 to allow for better historical comparisons. However, as more than one cycle of new content is required before this exercise can begin, users are encouraged to use caution when making historical comparisons. It is expected that backcasting will be completed and results released at the end of 2021. Larger-than-usual revisions may be anticipated in the future, as quarterly revisions, annual benchmarking, backcasting and new survey data received from respondents will be incorporated to improve data quality and include the most up-to-date data. Business performance and ownership statistics portal The Business performance and ownership statistics portal, accessible from the Subjects module of our website, provides users with a single point of access to a wide variety of information on business performance and ownership in Canada. Next release Financial statistics for enterprises for the third quarter of 2021 will be released on November 23, 2021. Products Aggregate balance sheet and income statement data for Canadian corporations are now available. Data from the Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements are also available.

August Labour Force Survey (LFS) data reflect labour market conditions during the week of August 15 to 21. By the August reference week, most jurisdictions in Canada had implemented the final or near-final stages of their public health reopening plans. Indoor locations, such as restaurants, recreation facilities, personal care services, retail stores, and entertainment venues, were generally permitted to be open, with varying degrees of capacity restrictions. In addition, for the first time since March 2020, on August 9 fully vaccinated non-essential travellers from the United States were permitted to enter Canada without quarantine requirements, expanding potential clientele for businesses in tourist areas. Highlights Employment rises for third consecutive month Employment rose by 90,000 (+0.5%) in August, the third consecutive monthly increase. Employment is within 156,000 (-0.8%) of its February 2020 level, the closest since the onset of the pandemic. August employment gains were concentrated in full-time work (+69,000; +0.4%). Increases were mainly in services-producing industries, led by accommodation and food services, and were spread across multiple demographic groups. Total hours worked were little changed and were 2.6% below their pre-pandemic level. Most of the employment gains occurred among private sector employees (+77,000; +0.6%). Self-employment was little changed. Among workers who worked at least half their usual hours, the proportion working from home fell 1.8 percentage points to 24.0% in August, the lowest share since the onset of the pandemic. Employment increased in the services-producing sector for the third consecutive month in August (+93,000), led by gains in accommodation and food services (+75,000), and information, culture and recreation (+24,000). The number of people working in construction increased (+20,000; +1.4%) for the first time since March 2021. Employment increased in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia. All other provinces recorded little or no change. Unemployment rate at lowest level since February 2020 The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 7.1% in August, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate among 15-to-69-year-olds who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities was 9.8% in August, little changed for a second consecutive month. Long-term unemployment dropped 29,000 (-6.7%) to 394,000 in August, but remained 215,000 (+120.0%) higher than in February 2020. Employment rises for third consecutive month Employment rose by 90,000 (+0.5%) in August, the third consecutive monthly increase. The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 7.1%. Employment gains were concentrated in full-time work (+69,000; +0.4%). Increases were mainly seen in services-producing industries, led by accommodation and food services, and were spread across multiple demographic groups. Combined with gains in June and July, the August increase brought employment to within 156,000 (-0.8%) of its February 2020 level, the closest since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The employment rate was 60.5% in August, 1.3 percentage points below the pre-pandemic rate. The number of employed people who worked less than half their usual hours was little changed in August, however, and remained elevated compared with February 2020 (+29.9%). Total hours worked were also little changed and were 2.6% below their pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Employment increased in each of the past three months Self-employment continues to lag Most of the employment gains in August occurred among private sector employees (+77,000; +0.6%), bringing their number to within 0.9% (-114,000) of its February 2020 level. Following a small dip in July, the number of employees in the public sector rebounded to its June level, rising 30,000 (+0.7%), and was up 180,000 (+4.6%) compared with February 2020. In contrast, self-employment was little changed in the month, remaining 7.7% (-222,000) below its pre-pandemic level. August marks the fifth consecutive month with no growth in self-employment. Chart 2 Self-employment little changed The share of Canadians working from home continues to fall Among workers who worked at least half their usual hours, the proportion working from home fell 1.8 percentage points to 24.0% in August, the lowest share since the onset of the pandemic. Just under half of those working from home (47.3%) reported that their usual work location was outside their home, down from two-thirds (66.8%) during the initial widespread lockdown in April 2020. In addition to employment gains or losses, and changes in work location, the number of people working at different locations may be affected by work absences, which are typically higher during the summer when workers are more likely to be on vacation. Employment rate among youth returns to pre-pandemic level Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 rose 22,000 (+0.9%) in August, entirely in part-time work. Although total youth employment was 41,000 (-1.6%) below its pre-pandemic level in August, the youth employment rate (57.6%)—the proportion of the population aged 15 to 24 who are employed—had essentially returned to its February 2020 level, a result of declines in the size of the youth population. The difference in the labour market outcomes between male and female youth has been notable during much of the pandemic period. Among women aged 15 to 24, employment rose 35,000 (+2.8%) in August. As a result, employment among young women essentially returned to its February 2020 level for the first time. Overall employment among young men dipped slightly below its pre-pandemic level in August (-30,000; -2.3%) after having essentially recovered in July; however, employment rates among both young men (56.0%) and women (56.3%) were on par with pre-pandemic rates. Notable employment gains since May among teens aged 15 to 19 (+140,000; +17.8%) have led to a widening gap in employment recovery between younger and older youth. Among teenagers, employment in August was 50,000 higher (+5.8%) than in February 2020; whereas employment among youth aged 20 to 24 was 92,000 lower (-5.3%). LFS results in the coming months will shed light on whether this trend continues into the fall, with many youth returning to school. Summer student employment lags pre-pandemic level among young women The challenges faced by older youth are also reflected in the labour market outcomes for returning students. From May to August, the LFS collects labour market data on youth aged 15 to 24 who were attending school full time in March and who intend to return to school in the fall. Published data are not seasonally adjusted, therefore comparisons can only be made on a year-over-year basis. For returning students aged 15 to 24, the average employment rate for May to August was 50.3%, 2.0 percentage points lower than the average rate for the summer of 2019 (52.3%), while it was nearly 10 percentage points higher than the rate in the summer of 2020 (40.4%). The average summer employment rate for female students (52.6%) was down 3.6 percentage points from the 2019 summer average (56.2%), mostly due to a notably lower rate in May 2021. In comparison, the rate for male students (47.6%) was little changed from its pre-pandemic level. Younger returning students fared better than older students in the 2021 summer labour market. The average employment rates for returning students aged 15 to 16 (29.3%) and 17 to 19 (57.0%) were essentially on par with those seen in the summer of 2019; while the rate for students aged 20 to 24 (63.0%) was down 5.1 percentage points. The employment rate among female students aged 20 to 24 was furthest from the 2019 summer average, down 7.5 percentage points to 64.3%. Employment growth for core-aged men and older workers Employment for core-aged men (that is, those aged 25 to 54) rose 24,000 (+0.4%) in August, while it was little changed for core-aged women. Among core-aged men, full-time gains (+49,000; +0.8%) more than offset part-time losses (-25,000; -6.1%). Employment for the core-aged population was 84,000 (-0.7%) below its February 2020 level, with similar deficits for men (-47,000) and women (-37,000). Among Canadians aged 55 and older, employment rose 28,000 (+0.7%) in August. Employment for older women remained 39,000 (-2.1%) lower than in February 2020, while employment for older men had returned to its pre-pandemic level in March 2021. Employment rate rises for Filipino Canadians In August, the employment rate increased among Filipino Canadians (+4.6 percentage points to 77.9%). In contrast, the employment rate for Black Canadians was down 3.6 percentage points to 71.8%. Among those who are not members of groups designated as visible minorities and who are not Indigenous, the employment rate (70.8%) was little changed from July (not seasonally adjusted). Employment rate for very recent immigrants continues upward trend The employment rate for very recent immigrants (in Canada for five years or less) continued its upward trend in August, reaching 70.4%, or 6.1 percentage points higher than in August 2019 (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Among immigrants who have been in Canada for more than five years, the employment rate was 58.5% in August, down 1.5 percentage points compared with August 2019. For people born in Canada, the employment rate was 61.4%, down 2.2 percentage points from its pre-COVID level (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). Among Indigenous people, employment rate recovers for both men and women In August, the employment rate among both Indigenous men (60.9%) and women (54.7%) was little changed from August 2019. This marks the first month in which the rate was on par with its pre-pandemic level for Indigenous women, while the rate among Indigenous men had recovered by May 2021. Despite this recovery, employment rates for both Indigenous men and women remained lower than those of their non-Indigenous counterparts, consistent with historical trends. Among non-Indigenous people, the employment rate in August remained lower than two years ago for both men (65.8%; -1.7 percentage points) and women (56.7%; -1.6 percentage points) (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). LFS information for Indigenous people reflects the experience of those who identify as First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, and who live off reserve in the provinces. Unemployment rate at lowest level since February 2020 The unemployment rate fell for the third consecutive month in August, down 0.4 percentage points to 7.1%, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate peaked at 13.7% in May 2020 and has trended downward since, despite some short-term increases during the fall of 2020 and spring of 2021. In the months leading up to the pandemic, the unemployment rate had hovered around historic lows and was 5.7% in February 2020. The adjusted unemployment rate—which includes those who wanted a job but did not look for one—was 9.1% in August, down 0.4 percentage points from one month earlier. Chart 3 Unemployment rate continues downward trend following pandemic-related spikes Drop in unemployment led by core-age men and women aged 55 and older Unemployment among core-aged men fell by 43,000 (-9.3%) in August. The unemployment rate for this group was down 0.6 percentage points to 6.2%, but remained 1.4 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level of 4.8%. For core-age women, unemployment was virtually unchanged in August and their unemployment rate was 5.8%, 1.1 percentage points above the pre-pandemic level. Among people aged 55 and older, unemployment fell by 26,000 (-7.3%) in August, almost entirely among older women. The unemployment rate for older women (6.8%) was 1.8 percentage points higher than in February 2020, while for men (7.7%) it was 2.4 percentage points higher. Unemployment for youth aged 15 to 24 was little changed in August. The unemployment rate for male youth (13.2%) was 1.4 percentage points higher than in February 2020, while the rate for female youth (9.8%) was virtually the same as its pre-pandemic level. Unemployment rate little changed for most visible minority groups The unemployment rate among 15-to-69-year-olds who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities was 9.8% in August, little changed for a second consecutive month (not seasonally adjusted). Chinese Canadians were the sole visible minority group to see a change in their unemployment rate (down 2.3 percentage points to 9.5%; not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the unemployment rate rose for a second consecutive month among people who were not Indigenous or a visible minority, up 0.5 percentage points to 7.0% (not seasonally adjusted). Number of long-term unemployed declines in August but remains a large proportion of the unemployed Long-term unemployment—the number of people continuously unemployed for 27 weeks or more—dropped 29,000 (-6.7%) to 394,000 in August, but remained 215,000 (+120.0%) higher than in February 2020. The long-term unemployed accounted for 27.4% of all unemployed in August, up from 15.6% just before the onset of the pandemic. Compared with its pre-COVID-19 level, long-term unemployment was up for all age groups in August, including youth aged 15 to 24 (+55.0%); core-aged people aged 25 to 54 (+128.1%); and people aged 55 and older (+143.1%). Among youth and core-aged people, the increase was larger for men than for women, while among older workers the increase was greater for women than it was for men. Among those who had been continuously unemployed for 27 weeks or more in August, one-third (33.7%; 136,000, not seasonally adjusted) had last worked prior to March 2020, and an additional 7.1% (29,000; not seasonally adjusted) had never worked. The remaining 59.2% of the long-term unemployed had lost or left their last job at some point during the pandemic. This includes 24.7% (100,000; not seasonally adjusted) who had last worked in March or April 2020, when the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown resulted in unprecedented employment losses, and 34.5% (140,000; not seasonally adjusted) whose last job ended between May 2020 and February 2021. Chart 4 Among the long-term unemployed, one in four last worked in March or April 2020 Labour market underutilization holds steady The labour underutilization rate was little changed at 14.2% in August. Above and beyond the unemployment rate, this rate reflects the proportion of people in the potential labour force who are unemployed; want a job but have not looked for one; or are employed but working less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19. The number of people searching for work dropped by 81,000 (-5.7%) in August and was the only component of underutilization to decline in the month. Three of the four components of the underutilization rate remained higher than before the pandemic. Compared with February 2020, there were more job searchers (+288,000; +27.7%); more people who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours (+243,000; +29.9%); and more people who wanted a job but who did not look for one (+68,000; +17.2%). The number of people on temporary layoff was virtually the same as it was pre-pandemic. Infographic 1 Labour underutilization little changed in August Participation in the labour force at pre-pandemic levels for most demographic groups The labour force participation rate—the total number of people who are employed or unemployed as a proportion of the population aged 15 and older—is an indicator of the balance between the number of people who are working or looking for work, and the number of people who are pursuing other activities, including studying, caring for family members, and pursuing leisure or voluntary activities. The participation rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 65.1% in August. The rate declined 0.4 percentage points to 91.1% among core-aged men, rose 0.5 percentage points to 65.1% for youth, and was little changed for the other major demographic groups. In recent months, participation rates have returned to what they were before the pandemic among all demographic groups except for among women aged 55 and older, where the August rate (31.5%) remained 1.0 percentage points below its February 2020 level. Job-changing rate increases As the easing of COVID-19 public health restrictions continues, employers face a number of challenges in resuming full business activities. At the same time, workers face their own challenges whether they are returning to their previous industries and occupations, or entering into new fields. During this period of adjustment between labour demand and supply, supplementary measures of labour market churn—the number of people changing employment status or changing jobs—are important complements to concepts such as employment, unemployment and job vacancies. The number of core-aged job leavers—people who left a job voluntarily in the previous 12 months and remained not employed in the LFS reference week—trended down throughout 2020 and early 2021, reaching a record low of 217,000 in April 2021. Since then, the number of job leavers has increased in parallel with improving labour market conditions. This increase continued in August, when the number of job leavers stood at 275,000, up from 257,000 in July (not seasonally adjusted). Despite this increase, the number of job leavers was substantially lower than in August 2019 (-89,000; -24.4%). In addition to job leavers, labour market churn includes job changers (workers who remain employed from one month to the next but who change jobs between months). The job-changing rate has gradually increased over the past year after falling to virtually zero in May 2020 following the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown. The job-changing rate was 0.8% in August, up from 0.6% in July. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the job-changing rate averaged 0.7% over the period from 2016 to 2019, and ranged from 0.6% to 0.8%. Chart 5 Job-changing rate returns to pre-pandemic level Wage growth continues to be influenced by changes in the composition of employment Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicators of wage change have been influenced by the fact that large employment decreases and increases have been proportionately larger among lower-paid workers. Various methods exist to provide a clearer picture of wage trends by removing the effects of changes in the composition of employment. One such method—a fixed-weighted average wage—holds the distribution of employees across occupations and job tenures constant at the 2019 average. Based on the fixed-weighted average, average wages were up 5.2% (+$1.48) in August compared with the 2019 average. Without controlling for compositional changes, actual average wages were 7.1% (+$1.98) higher in August 2021 than in 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 6 Growth in average wages is tempered when job tenure and occupation are held constant Services-producing sector employment returns to pre-COVID level Employment increased in the services-producing sector for the third consecutive month in August (+93,000), led by gains in accommodation and food services (+75,000), and information, culture and recreation (+24,000). Smaller monthly increases were also recorded in professional, scientific and technical services (+15,000), and public administration (+14,000), while employment declined in ""other services"" (-30,000), finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (-17,000), and business, building and other support services (-17,000). The overall gain in August pushed employment in the services-producing sector as a whole back to its pre-COVID level for the first time, although not all industries within the sector have fully recovered. In August, the number of people working in the goods-producing sector was little changed, with gains in construction (+20,000) partially offset by a decline in agriculture (-11,000). Chart 7 Employment in some industries remains further behind despite service-sector recovery Gap with pre-COVID employment remains uneven across the services-producing sector Despite the overall return to pre-COVID employment in the services-producing sector in August, several industries remain further behind in their recovery. In services-producing industries that were deemed essential during the pandemic, or where a high proportion of workers were able to work from home, COVID-related job losses were initially more moderate, and employment is now well above pre-pandemic levels. This includes professional, scientific and technical services (+10.0%; +153,000), public administration (+7.1%; +71,000) and educational services (+5.3%; +73,000). Employment remains below pre-COVID levels in services-producing industries where a higher proportion of jobs involve close contact with others, with accommodation and food services (-12.6%; -154,000) and ""other services"" (-11.1%; -90,000) posting notable gaps in August compared with February 2020. Employment in accommodation and food services at pre-COVID level in two provinces Employment rose by 75,000 (+7.5%) in accommodation and food services in August, with most of the increase concentrated in Ontario. LFS results for August fully capture the reopening of indoor dining in the province, which occurred towards the end of the July LFS reference week. While employment in the industry remains behind pre-pandemic levels in most provinces, the number of workers in accommodation and food services has returned to its pre-COVID level in New Brunswick and Manitoba. More people working in information, culture and recreation In August, employment increased by 24,000 (+3.4%) in information, culture and recreation, with nearly all of the gains in Ontario. Border restrictions on non-essential travel were lifted for fully vaccinated Americans on August 9 and spectator sports began to welcome back live audiences at the beginning of the month. While employment in information, culture and recreation remains 5.7% (-44,000) below its pre-pandemic level nationally, the number of people working in the industry has returned to its February 2020 level in five provinces, including Ontario and British Columbia. Service-sector growth tempered by losses in ""other services"" The number of people working in ""other services,"" which includes religious, grant-making, civic and professional organizations, as well as repair and maintenance services, declined by 30,000 (-4.0%) in August, almost entirely as a result of losses in Ontario and British Columbia. In August, employment also declined in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (-17,000; -1.3%) and business, building and other support services (-17,000; -2.3%). First employment increase in construction since March 2021 Employment in the goods-producing sector was little changed for the second consecutive month. The sector has yet to recoup losses recorded in May and June 2021, and employment remained 3.6% (-142,000) below its pre-COVID level in August. Most of the remaining gap in the sector is attributable to the construction (43.6%) and agriculture (39.9%) industries. The number of people working in construction increased for the first time since March 2021, rising by 20,000 (+1.4%). Nearly all of the gains were in Ontario and British Columbia. Despite the monthly increase, the industry remains 4.2% (-62,000) below the level recorded in February 2020. Employment in agriculture declined by 11,000 (-4.2%) in August. After a partial recovery of COVID-related job losses in late 2020, employment in the industry has declined by 38,000 since November 2020, and was 18.9% (-57,000) below its pre-COVID level in August 2021, proportionally the largest gap among all industries. Businesses in the agriculture industry have faced a number of challenges since the beginning of the pandemic. Fewer agricultural workers entered Canada through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program in 2020 (Agriculture and agri-food labour statistics, 2020) and, more recently, ongoing drought conditions in Western Canada have negatively affected crop growth and yield potential across much of the Prairies (Production of principal field crops, July 2021). Employment up in four provinces Employment increased in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia in August. All other provinces recorded little or no change. For the third consecutive month, British Columbia was the lone province with employment above its pre-pandemic level. Compared with February 2020, the employment gap was largest in Prince Edward Island (-3.4%) and New Brunswick (-2.7%). For further information on key province and industry level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" Employment in Ontario rose for the third successive month (+53,000; +0.7%) in August, nearly all in part-time work. In the Toronto census metropolitan area, employment increased by 73,000 (+2.1%). The additional employment brought overall provincial gains since May 2021 to 242,000 (+3.4%). The accommodation and food services industry contributed the bulk of the employment increase, while educational services, and information, culture and recreation also had notable gains. In contrast, there were notable declines in manufacturing, and ""other services."" For the second consecutive month, the unemployment rate in Ontario fell, dropping 0.4 percentage points to 7.6%. In Alberta, where most public health restrictions were lifted as of July 1, employment rose by 20,000 (+0.9%) in August, the first notable increase since March 2021. Gains were led by transportation and warehousing, followed by information, culture and recreation, and accommodation and food services. The unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage points to 7.9%, the lowest since the pre-pandemic rate of 7.5% in February 2020. In Saskatchewan, employment increased by 10,000 (+1.8%) in August, offsetting losses in June and July. Employment was up in wholesale and retail trade, following losses in June and July. The unemployment rate in Saskatchewan held steady at 7.0%. Employment in Nova Scotia rose by 3,900 (+0.8%) in August, with all of the increase in part-time work. The employment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 56.6%, but remained lower than in February 2020 (57.5%). The unemployment rate dropped 0.6 percentage points to 7.8%. Employment rate remains higher in Canada than in the United States While international comparisons of the pandemic's impact on labour markets are challenging due to differences in concepts, survey design and reference periods, comparisons between the labour market situation in Canada and in the United States can be made by adjusting Canadian data to US concepts. For more information, see ""Measuring Employment and Unemployment in Canada and the United States – A comparison."" A frequent point of comparison between Canada and the United States is the employment rate, defined as the number of people who are employed as a percentage of the working-age population, which is typically higher in Canada. Adjusted to US concepts, and for the population aged 16 and older, the employment rate was 61.0% in Canada and 58.5% in the United States in August. The rate was down 1.4 percentage points from February 2020 in Canada, compared with a drop of 2.6 percentage points in the United States. The unemployment rate, adjusted to US concepts, was 5.8% in Canada in August, 0.6 percentage points higher than in the United States (5.2%). The rate was 1.2 percentage points higher than in February 2020 in Canada, while in the United States it was 1.7 percentage points higher. The labour force participation rate, also adjusted to US concepts, was 64.7% in Canada in August, down 0.7 percentage points from February 2020. In the United States, the participation rate was 61.7%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from February 2020. Looking ahead Over the coming months, labour market conditions may be influenced by ongoing developments, including continuing vaccination efforts, rising COVID-19 cases, the start of a new school year, and the lifting of border restrictions for all fully vaccinated international visitors on September 7. LFS results for the week of September 12 to 18 will be released on October 8.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for August are for the week of August 15 to 21. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). Since March 2020, all LFS face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both respondents and interviewers. While this has resulted in a decline in the LFS response rate, more than 40,000 interviews were completed in August and in-depth data quality evaluations conducted each month confirm that the LFS continues to produce an accurate portrait of Canada's labour market. The suspension of face-to-face interviewing has had a larger impact on response rates in Nunavut than in other jurisdictions. Due to the larger decline in response rates for Nunavut, and resulting changes in the composition of the responding sample, data for Nunavut (table 14-10-0292-01) should be used with caution. To reduce the risks associated with declining data quality for Nunavut, users are advised to use 12-month averages (available upon request) rather than 3-month averages when possible. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the quality of LFS data for Nunavut each month and provide users with updated guidelines as required. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. The distribution of LFS interviews in August 2021 compared with July 2021, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • July 2021: 63.6% • August 2021: 64.1% Online interviews • July 2021: 36.4% • August 2021: 35.9% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. The five occupation groups with the lowest average hourly wages in 2019: sales support occupations; service support and other service occupations, n.e.c.; service supervisors and specialized service occupations; labourers in processing, manufacturing and utilities; and service representatives and other customer and personal services occupations. The five occupation groups with the highest average hourly wages in 2019: professional occupations in natural and applied sciences; occupations in front-line public protection services; middle management occupations in trades, transportation, production and utilities; specialized middle management occupations; senior management occupations. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in August 2021 analysis Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business,' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Information on population groups Since July 2020, the LFS has included a question asking respondents to report the population group(s) to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2021 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, people who identify as a member of a population group (visible minority) are analyzed separately. Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Next release The next release of the LFS will be on October 8, 2021. September data will reflect labour market conditions during the week of September 12 to 18.

Beyond deaths attributed to the disease itself, the pandemic could also have indirect consequences that increase or decrease the number of deaths as a result of various factors, including delayed medical procedures, increased substance use, or declines in deaths attributable to other causes, such as influenza. To understand both the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, it is important to measure excess mortality, which occurs when there are more deaths than expected in a given period. It should be noted that, even without a pandemic, there is always some year-to-year variation in the number of people who die in a given week. This means that the number of expected deaths should fall within a certain range of values. There is evidence of excess mortality when weekly deaths are consistently higher than the expected number, but especially when they exceed the range of what is expected over several consecutive weeks. From March 2020 to the beginning of June 2021, there were an estimated 23,547 excess deaths in Canada, or 6.7% more deaths than what would be expected were there no pandemic, after accounting for changes in the population, such as aging. Over this same period, 24,910 deaths were directly attributed to COVID-19. While COVID-19 deaths were still observed, significant excess mortality has not been observed nationally for the total population using the provisional death data since February 2021. Building on insights based on excess mortality, age-standardized mortality rates for 2020—which are adjusted to account for changes in population size and age composition—are compared with previous years to better understand how overall mortality trends for certain age groups may have been driven by different causes of death. Overall mortality rates in 2020 increased for all age groups compared with previous years—particularly for the youngest and oldest populations. However, while COVID-19 appeared to be the main driver for increased mortality rates in 2020 among older populations, for younger age groups, increases in unintentional poisonings (which includes overdoses) were also a factor. As part of Statistics Canada's commitment to providing timely and relevant information on COVID-19 and its impact on Canadians, a new updated provisional dataset from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database, covering the period from January 2020 to June 2021, was released today. Updates were also made to the provisional death estimates, which have been adjusted, where possible, to account for the incomplete nature of the counts. The provisional estimates will continue to be revised in future releases, as more information is reported by provincial and territorial vital statistics agencies, and as estimation methods continue to be enhanced. Increased deaths in 2020 reverse a decade of declines in national mortality rates After experiencing years of relatively steady declines in mortality rates, Canada saw a significant increase in the overall age-standardized mortality rate for 2020. Over the past decade, the national overall mortality rate decreased by 7.2%, from 705.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 654.6 in 2019. In 2020, this decline in national age-standardized mortality rates was reversed with a rate of 691.4—the highest overall national age-standardized mortality rate observed in 10 years. Chart 1 Age-standardized mortality rates, all ages, both sexes, Canada, 2011 to 2020 Overall, increases in the mortality rates in 2020 were closely aligned with mortality rates directly attributed to COVID-19. In 2020, the age-standardized mortality rate for deaths due directly to COVID-19 was 35.1 deaths per 100,000 population. This was similar to the increase of 36.8 deaths per 100,000 population in the age-standardized mortality rate from 2019 (654.6) to 2020 (691.4). Analysis of excess mortality trends observed a similar alignment between the number of COVID-19-caused deaths and excess mortality. However, a closer examination reveals that this was not the case for some age groups. For example, 2,992 excess deaths were observed in 2020 in the 0-44 age category, while the same age group experienced fewer than 100 deaths attributed directly to COVID-19 over the same period. Increases in mortality rates among those under the age of 45 are partly explained by increased overdoses Whereas the overall age-standardized mortality rate was steadily declining in the years leading up to the pandemic, the same cannot be said for those in the 0-44 age group. From 2011 to 2015, the mortality rate for this age group stayed relatively stable at around 35 deaths per 100,000 population. However, this rose in subsequent years, peaking at 38.7 in 2017 and then dropping to 36.8 in 2019. This pattern coincided with increased mortality due to unintentional poisonings, which includes deaths associated with overdoses. From 2011 to 2016, the mortality rate for unintentional poisonings in this age group increased from 2.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 5.4 in 2016. In 2017, the mortality rate for this cause of death among those younger than 45 peaked at 7.4 deaths per 100,000 population, before the rates started to decline, to a low of 4.7 in 2019. While the overall mortality rate for those younger than 45 was in decline in 2019, this changed in 2020. For this age group, the mortality rate rose 17.4% from 2019 to 43.2 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020—the highest rate observed since 1995. This increase in age-standardized mortality rates among those younger than 45 cannot be fully explained by deaths attributed directly to COVID-19. For this age group, the mortality rate due to COVID-19 was 0.25 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020, which amounted to fewer than 100 deaths attributed directly to the disease. On the other hand, similar to the overall trend for this age group, the age-standardized mortality rate for unintentional poisonings in the 0-44 age group increased by 43% from 2019 to 6.7 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020, reversing the decline observed from 2017 to 2019. Age-standardized mortality rates for 2020 were relatively stable among the natural causes of death that are most common in the 0-44 age group. Cancers (4.6 deaths per 100,000 population) and heart disease (1.8 deaths per 100,000 population) in 2020 remained similar to rates reported in 2018 and 2019. Although cause of death information for all ages is 97% complete for 2020, 22% of the cause of death information on the 0-44 age group remains incomplete, pending additional investigation. Therefore, there is a possibility that the specific cause of death rates reported above may increase as information continues to be reported. Unintentional poisonings and COVID-19 leading to increased mortality rates for those aged 45 to 64 Similar to overall trends, the 45-64 age group had experienced steady declines in age-standardized mortality rates leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting a low of 108.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2019. However, in 2020, the mortality rate for this age group rose to 117.5 deaths per 100,000 population, which was 8.3% higher than in 2019 and the highest rate for this age group since 2012 (117.8). Looking at patterns by cause of death, deaths due to both COVID-19 and unintentional poisonings have contributed to the increase in 2020. The age-standardized mortality rate for COVID-19-caused deaths was 2.2 deaths per 100,000 population for this age group. On the other hand, the mortality rate for unintentional poisonings increased by 33.3% among 45-to-64-year-olds, from 3.6 deaths per 100,000 population in 2019 to 4.8 in 2020. Nearly 8% of the cause of death information for the 45-64 age group in 2020 is incomplete, pending further investigation. Therefore, there is a possibility that the specific cause of death rates reported for this age group may also increase as information becomes more complete. COVID-19 driving increased mortality rates for those aged 65 and older Among those aged 65-84, age-standardized mortality rates had been in steady decline over the years, dropping from 312.3 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 280.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2019. In 2020, the rate increased to 290.2 deaths per 100,000 population—the highest it has been since 2017. At the same time, the age-standardized mortality rate for COVID-19-caused deaths in 2020 among those in the 65-84 age category was 14.3 deaths per 100,000 population. The fact that the COVID-19 mortality rate is higher than the overall increase in this age group's mortality rate compared with 2019 suggests that rates for other causes of death have declined. In fact, the age-standardized mortality rates for those aged 65-84 for cancer, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory infections have all experienced a steady decline since 2011 and this trend continued in 2020. For those aged 85 and older, from 2011 to 2019, age-standardized mortality rates fluctuated, but generally declined from 239.8 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 228.9 in 2019. Mortality rates for this age group increased by 5.1% to 240.6 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020, marking the highest mortality rate for this age group in Canada since 2010. Similar to the trend for those aged 65-84, the COVID-19 mortality rate for the 85-and-older age group outpaced the overall increase in the mortality rate from 2019 to 2020. The age-standardized mortality rate for COVID-19-caused deaths among individuals aged 85 and older was 18.4 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020. The emergence of COVID-19 variants of concern and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in Canada will likely have an impact on mortality trends. Statistics Canada will continue to provide timely information on a regular basis on excess deaths, causes of death and comorbidities as it becomes available. Note to readers A new updated provisional dataset from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database, covering the period from January 2020 to June 2021, was released today. Updates were also made to the provisional death estimates, which have been adjusted, where possible, to account for the incomplete nature of the counts. The provisional estimates will continue to be revised in future releases as more information is reported by provincial and territorial vital statistics agencies and as estimation methods continue to be enhanced. The data released today are provisional, as they are not based on all deaths that occurred during the reference period because of reporting delays, and they do not include Yukon. Provisional death counts are based on what is reported to Statistics Canada by provincial and territorial vital statistics registries. Provisional death estimates have been adjusted to account for incomplete data, where possible. The numbers of excess deaths discussed in this analysis refer to provisional estimates. Information on the methods used can be found in the ""Definitions, data sources and methods"" section for Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database. The provisional death counts and estimates released today may not match figures from other sources, such as media reports, or counts and estimates from provincial and territorial health authorities and other agencies. There are a number of ways to measure excess mortality, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. There are also a number of challenges with measuring excess mortality, most importantly, properly estimating the number of expected deaths that would occur in a non-COVID-19 context as a comparison basis for the current death counts. Important variations may be observed from year to year in the annual death counts, in particular in the less populated provinces and in the territories. Moreover, yearly death counts may be affected by changes in the composition of the population, in regard to age more particularly, and changes in mortality rates (e.g. improvement of mortality). In the Canadian context, with an aging and growing population, the number of deaths has been steadily increasing over recent years and so a higher number of deaths in 2020 and 2021 would be expected regardless of COVID-19. A second challenge is the difficulty of collecting timely death counts. In Canada, death data are collected by the provincial and territorial vital statistical offices. The capacity to provide death data to Statistics Canada in a timely manner varies greatly. Taking these considerations into account, the method chosen by Statistics Canada—which has also been adopted by organizations in several other countries, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—to estimate expected deaths, is adapted from an infectious disease detection algorithm which has been largely utilized in the context of mortality surveillance in recent years. Rates are a useful tool for comparing characteristics across different populations, different segments of a population, or the same population over time. One type of rate is a percentage, i.e. the number of individuals exhibiting a characteristic or particular behaviour per 100 people. When rates are used to examine unusual events, such as death due to a particular cause, they are often expressed as the number of people or occurrences per 100,000 population in the population. As with percentages, these rates take into account the underlying population size. This article uses age-standardized mortality rates to show the number of deaths per 100,000 population that would have occurred by specified age groups and selected causes of death in Canada if the age structure of the population was the same as the age structure of a specified standard population. The advantage of using age-standardization mortality rates is that they allow for the comparisons across different geographies and over time, because age-standardization removes the effects of differences in the age structure of populations. The standard population used for this analysis was the 2011 population. For more information on age-standardized mortality rates, please consult the Vital Statistics Death Database – Glossary. The tabulation of the causes of death is based on the underlying causes of death, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the disease or injury that initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or as the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause of death is selected from the causes and conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death completed by a medical professional, medical examiner or coroner. More information on causes of death, including the certification and classification of COVID-19 deaths, can be found in the study ""COVID-19 death comorbidities in Canada."" The provisional figures on the number of deaths, the causes of death and excess mortality will continue to be updated as more information is reported to Statistics Canada by the provinces and territories and as further enhancements are made to the estimation models. More information on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is available in the article, ""Excess mortality in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic."" Detailed information on the causes of death in Canada for 2020 will be released on November 26, 2021. References to the period from March 2020 to beginning of June 2021 refer to the period from the week ending March 28, 2020, to the week ending June 5, 2021. References to 2020 are to the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, inclusive.

All provinces except British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador posted lower values, with the majority of the national decline reported in Alberta (-23.4%). Building permits fell 3.1% in the residential sector and 5.6% in the non-residential sector. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), building permits fell 3.8% to $7.0 billion. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, July 2021 Ontario weighs down residential permits nationally Seven provinces reported declines in the residential sector, led by Ontario (-10.5%). Single-family permits fell 9.6% in July, with two provinces showing growth. Ontario (-9.1%) contributed the most to the decrease. Construction intentions for multi-family units rose 2.7% in July. British Columbia posted an increase of 55.1%, which was driven by high-valued condo projects in the city of Surrey. In contrast, Ontario reversed strong growth in June (+67.6%) and fell 11.7% in July due to fewer high-valued condo permits reported for the census metropolitan areas (CMA) of Hamilton and Guelph. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Non-residential permits down in July Non-residential permit values declined 5.6% to $2.9 billion in July, despite Ontario's strong growth of 17.3%. Seven provinces were down, with Alberta reporting the largest decrease (-46.9%). Institutional permits decreased for a third consecutive month to $718 million, with eight provinces reporting lower values. The majority of the decline stemmed from Quebec (-36.8%), following a strong June (+40.0%) when multiple high-valued permits were issued for alternative care and senior homes. Conversely, Ontario saw a 60.0% increase, with projects such as the Linhaven nursing home and a new secondary school both in the CMA of St. Catharines–Niagara. Alberta's commercial permits fell 45.5% in July, following a notable increase in June (+56.6%). The decline in Alberta and in six other provinces pulled the value of commercial permits at the national level down 6.9% to $1.6 billion. The value of industrial permits was up 17.6% to $612 million, with half the provinces reporting growth. Quebec (+59.5%) led the increase, with a $30 million warehouse permit, and was followed by Nova Scotia (+412.3%), where a $40 million composting facility permit was issued.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates are available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (e.g., single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (e.g., apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for August will be released on October 4, 2021.

Terms of trade 106.3 (2012=100) Second quarter 2021 Source(s): Table 36-10-0105-01. Substantial declines in home resale activities and exports pushed real gross domestic product (GDP) down 0.3% in the second quarter of 2021. This contrasted with three consecutive quarterly increases that followed the sharp decline (-11.3%) caused by pandemic-related business shutdowns and travel restrictions in the second quarter of 2020. Increases in investment in business inventories, government final consumption expenditures, business investment in machinery and equipment, and investment in new home construction and renovation were not sufficient to offset the declines in exports (-4.0%) and home ownership transfer costs (-17.7%), which include all costs associated with the transfer of a residential asset from one owner to another. Imports were flat in the second quarter. Real gross national income rose 1.5%, reflecting gains from higher prices of exported crude oil and crude bitumen. Final domestic demand edged up 0.2%, following the 1.6% rise in the first quarter. Chart 1 Real gross domestic product and final domestic demand Chart 2 Contributions to percentage change in real gross domestic product, second quarter of 2021 Businesses accumulated $9.7 billion in inventories, compared with a $6.2 billion withdrawal in the first quarter. The inventory accumulation, which was the major contributor to GDP during the quarter, was led by durable retail goods. Housing investment reshapes the economy Since the third quarter of 2020, housing investment has emerged as the predominant contributor to economic activities and to capital stock—with residential capital stock surpassing non-residential capital stock. Moreover, the average housing investment for the previous four quarters was 17% higher than the average over the last five years. Chart 3 Housing investment Both new construction and renovations—the components of residential capital stock—have shown sustained growth since the third quarter of 2020. Because of the ability to work from home, savings from less travel and reduced participation in other activities, low mortgage rates and increases in home equity lines of credit, spending has continued to increase on new houses (+3.2%) and home renovations (+2.4%). After taking on $62.3 billion of residential mortgage debt in the last half of 2020, households added $84.2 billion more residential housing debt in the first half of 2021. Household spending flat Household spending, which rose 0.7% in the first quarter, edged up 0.1% in the second quarter. This reflected a drop in spending on goods—32 out of 48 categories of goods experienced decreases. Chart 4 Household final consumption of durable goods and services Outlays for durable goods declined in the quarter, as higher prices for many products constrained demand. With the easing of pandemic restrictions, outlays for services increased (+1.8%), led by food and beverage services (+4.3%). Business investment in machinery and equipment rebounds Business investment in machinery and equipment rose 5.7%, reflecting a sharp increase in investment in aircraft and other transportation equipment. This followed a sharp decline in the first quarter owing to a large disinvestment of used aircraft. Industrial machinery and equipment investment rose 4.8%, stemming from substantial imports. Supply chain disruptions continue to impact motor vehicles Shortages of microchips and other inputs curtailed trade in motor vehicles and domestic consumption. Household purchases of new passenger cars (-7.2%) and trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles (-1.6%) decreased, while business investment in medium and heavy trucks, buses and other motor vehicles fell 34.2%. Longer plant shutdowns because of international supply chain disruptions have constrained imports of parts and led to significant decreases in exports. Low production of motor vehicles and parts resulted in an 18.9% drop in exports of passenger cars and light trucks and an 8.7% decline in tires, motor vehicle engines and parts exports. Inventories had another quarter of significant drawdowns in response to supply needs. Continued rises in prices and nominal gross domestic product The GDP implicit price index, which reflects the overall price of domestically produced goods and services, rose 2.2% in the second quarter, driven by prices of construction materials and energy. This growth followed a 3.0% increase in the first quarter. Consequently, nominal GDP increased 1.9%. Led by professional and personal services, construction, trade, and health and mining industries, compensation of employees rose 1.4%, reflecting heightened activity as lockdowns eased. Quebec (+2.8%), Alberta (+2.8%), and British Columbia (+1.5%) led the national wage increases in the second quarter. Terms-of-trade improves and real gross national income rises The terms-of-trade—that is, the ratio of the price of exports to the price of imports—was up 4.2%. This increase was led by a 4.9% increase in export prices, primarily a 17.7% increase in the price of exported crude oil and crude bitumen. Increased terms-of-trade contributed to higher real gross national income (+1.5%), which captures the real purchasing power of income earned by Canadian-owned production factors. Double-digit household savings rate continues The modest rise in household spending (+0.7%, in nominal terms) was outpaced by growth in disposable income (+2.2%) leaving households with more net savings than in the previous quarter. Household incomes were primarily bolstered by rising compensation of employees along with increasing transfers received from government, which were partially offset by a 2.8% rise in personal income taxes. Consequently, the savings rate reached 14.2%—the fifth consecutive quarter with a double-digit savings rate—as various pandemic-related restrictions and uncertainty continued to limit the scope of household consumption. The household savings rate is aggregated across all income brackets; in general, savings rates are greater in higher income brackets.

Data on gross domestic product, income and expenditure are an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on global sustainable development goals. This release will be used to measure the following goals: Note to readers Revisions Data on gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2021 have been released along with the revised data of the first quarter of 2021. Support measures by governments To alleviate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments implemented a number of programs, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. For a comprehensive explanation of how government support measures were treated in the compilation of the estimates, see ""Recording COVID-19 measures in the national accounts"" and ""Recording new COVID measures in the national accounts.""

For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. For more information on GDP, see the video ""What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?"" Percentage change Percentage changes for expenditure-based statistics (such as household spending, investment and exports) are calculated from volume measures that are adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-based statistics (such as compensation of employees and operating surplus) are calculated from nominal values, that is, they are not adjusted for price variations. Unless otherwise stated, growth rates represent the percentage change in the series from one quarter to the next; for instance, from the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 4.1% on a year-over-year basis in August, the fastest pace since March 2003, up from a 3.7% gain in July. The increase in prices mainly stems from an accumulation of recent price pressures and from lower price levels in 2020. Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 3.2% year over year. The monthly CPI rose 0.2% in August, down from a 0.6% increase in July. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.4%. Chart 1 12-month change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and CPI excluding gasoline Highlights Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, durable goods have been a major contributor to the increase in the CPI. Durable goods rose at a faster pace in August (+5.7%) compared with July (+5.0%), with passenger vehicles (+7.2%), furniture (+8.7%) and household appliances (+5.3%) contributing the most to the increase. In addition, prices for services have accelerated for the fifth consecutive month, rising at a faster pace in August (+2.7%) compared with July (+2.6%) amid easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Year over year, prices for traveller accommodation rose 19.3%. Reopening of businesses and summer travel contributed to the price increases. Prices rose in seven of the eight major components in August, with transportation prices contributing the most to the all-items increase. Conversely, consumers paid less for clothing and footwear, as prices declined year over year. Chart 2 Prices rise in seven major components Gasoline prices rise in August Year over year, gasoline prices rose 32.5% in August, mainly driven by lower production from oil-producing countries compared with pre-pandemic levels. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were the low price levels observed in August 2020. Gasoline prices rose 0.4% month over month in August. Upward pressure on prices near the end of the month—as some offshore production was suspended due to Hurricane Ida—was partially offset by slowing global demand due to concerns associated with the rise of the Delta variant of COVID-19. Infographic 1 Gasoline prices rise in August Homeowners' replacement cost index rises at the fastest pace in more than three decades The homeowners' replacement cost index, which is related to the price of new homes, continued to trend upward, rising 14.3% year over year in August—the largest yearly increase since September 1987. This was the fourth consecutive month of double-digit price growth. Similarly, the other owned accommodation expenses index, which includes commission fees on the sale of real estate, rose 14.3% year over year in August. Chart 3 Yearly price changes in the homeowners' replacement cost index Spotlight on the digital economy The rise of the digital economy has altered the consumption patterns of Canadians, as more goods and services can be purchased and consumed online. From 2018 to 2020, online spending rose by almost half, as online shopping and new digital goods and services became more popular. To gain additional insight into prices related to the digital economy, a special aggregate price index for digital economy services was published with the release of the August 2021 CPI. The special aggregate comprises consumer prices for cellular services, parcel post services, Internet access services, ride sharing, broadcasting distribution services, video streaming services and audio streaming services. The price series is available back to January 2019 and is published at the national level. On a year-over-year basis, prices for digital economy services fell 4.8%, mainly driven by lower prices for cellular services (-18.9%). Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of consuming digital goods and services increased. Many stores and businesses were temporarily closed to curb the spread of the virus, leading consumers toward more online shopping. In addition, as Canadians spent more time at home, consumption of online entertainment activities, such as streaming video content online, increased. The video and audio subscription services index, which includes video streaming services, rose 5.8% year over year in August. As the digital economy evolves, Statistics Canada will continue to monitor and incorporate new goods and services in order to maintain relevance and reflect changes in consumer spending. Traveller accommodation prices increase in August The traveller accommodation price index rose 19.3% year over year in August. Prices accelerated in every province, as travel restrictions eased and demand for travel increased. Prices rose the most in British Columbia (+26.9%), but price increases were also seen in Newfoundland and Labrador (+26.3%), New Brunswick (+23.4%), Quebec (+22.5%) and Ontario (+21.2%). Infographic 2 Prices for traveller accommodation increase in August Prices for meat products increase in August Year over year, prices for meat products rose at the fastest pace in August (+6.9%) since June 2020 (+8.1%). Prices for fresh or frozen chicken were up 8.4%, partly based on higher input costs and growing demand from restaurants. Prices for fresh and frozen pork also increased on a year-over-year basis in August (+9.3%), mainly the result of higher input costs and supply chain issues. Chart 4 Prices for meat accelerate year over year in August Regional highlights Year over year, prices rose at a faster pace in August than in July in every province. Chart 5 The Consumer Price Index rises at a faster pace in all provinces Rent prices increase in Nova Scotia Year over year, rent prices rose at a slower pace across the country in August (+1.6%) compared with July (+2.6%). The largest exception to this slowing pace was Nova Scotia, where rent prices rose 7.5% year over year in August, compared with 5.0% in July. Similar year-over-year movements in August were observed in New Brunswick (+8.7%) and Prince Edward Island (+7.9%).

When a good or service became available for consumption again, an adjustment factor was calculated to remove the impact of imputations so that the indexes only reflect observed price movements. More information on these adjustments can be found in the March 2021 Technical supplement. With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the availability of vaccines, Canadians are able to consume travel services to most destinations, including in the Southern and Asia-Pacific sectors, which accounted for 0.07% of the 2020 CPI basket, and certain components of travel tours, which represented 0.46% of the 2020 CPI basket. With the August CPI, these services are no longer being imputed and adjustment factors are being applied. The August index levels for these components of the air transportation and travel tours indexes are obtained by comparing August 2021 and the last observed prices in 2020. This procedure removes the impact of all imputations performed in the months where these services were not available for consumption. This treatment corresponds to the approach used for the re-introduction of seasonal products in the CPI in the first month of their in-season period. The headline CPI for August 2021 would have been the same with or without the re-introduction of the components for travel tours and air transportation. Users are advised to exercise caution in interpreting the 1-month change for August 2021 and the 12-month change for the next 12 months for the travel tours and air transportation indexes. In August 2021, all special treatments for unavailable items were removed with the exception of cruise-based travel tours, accounting for 0.03% of the 2020 CPI basket. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the impacted component and will remove these special treatments as it becomes widely available for consumption. The details of the treatments from April 2020 to March 2021 are provided in technical supplements available through the Prices Analytical Series. Details and other treatment information for April 2021 to August 2021 are available upon request. Statistics Canada continues to work with price experts, national statistical organizations and other partners to ensure the data and methods used in the calculation of the official CPI are aligned with international standards.

August Labour Force Survey (LFS) data reflect labour market conditions during the week of August 15 to 21. By the August reference week, most jurisdictions in Canada had implemented the final or near-final stages of their public health reopening plans. Indoor locations, such as restaurants, recreation facilities, personal care services, retail stores, and entertainment venues, were generally permitted to be open, with varying degrees of capacity restrictions. In addition, for the first time since March 2020, on August 9 fully vaccinated non-essential travellers from the United States were permitted to enter Canada without quarantine requirements, expanding potential clientele for businesses in tourist areas. Highlights Employment rises for third consecutive month Employment rose by 90,000 (+0.5%) in August, the third consecutive monthly increase. Employment is within 156,000 (-0.8%) of its February 2020 level, the closest since the onset of the pandemic. August employment gains were concentrated in full-time work (+69,000; +0.4%). Increases were mainly in services-producing industries, led by accommodation and food services, and were spread across multiple demographic groups. Total hours worked were little changed and were 2.6% below their pre-pandemic level. Most of the employment gains occurred among private sector employees (+77,000; +0.6%). Self-employment was little changed. Among workers who worked at least half their usual hours, the proportion working from home fell 1.8 percentage points to 24.0% in August, the lowest share since the onset of the pandemic. Employment increased in the services-producing sector for the third consecutive month in August (+93,000), led by gains in accommodation and food services (+75,000), and information, culture and recreation (+24,000). The number of people working in construction increased (+20,000; +1.4%) for the first time since March 2021. Employment increased in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia. All other provinces recorded little or no change. Unemployment rate at lowest level since February 2020 The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 7.1% in August, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate among 15-to-69-year-olds who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities was 9.8% in August, little changed for a second consecutive month. Long-term unemployment dropped 29,000 (-6.7%) to 394,000 in August, but remained 215,000 (+120.0%) higher than in February 2020. Employment rises for third consecutive month Employment rose by 90,000 (+0.5%) in August, the third consecutive monthly increase. The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 7.1%. Employment gains were concentrated in full-time work (+69,000; +0.4%). Increases were mainly seen in services-producing industries, led by accommodation and food services, and were spread across multiple demographic groups. Combined with gains in June and July, the August increase brought employment to within 156,000 (-0.8%) of its February 2020 level, the closest since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The employment rate was 60.5% in August, 1.3 percentage points below the pre-pandemic rate. The number of employed people who worked less than half their usual hours was little changed in August, however, and remained elevated compared with February 2020 (+29.9%). Total hours worked were also little changed and were 2.6% below their pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Employment increased in each of the past three months Self-employment continues to lag Most of the employment gains in August occurred among private sector employees (+77,000; +0.6%), bringing their number to within 0.9% (-114,000) of its February 2020 level. Following a small dip in July, the number of employees in the public sector rebounded to its June level, rising 30,000 (+0.7%), and was up 180,000 (+4.6%) compared with February 2020. In contrast, self-employment was little changed in the month, remaining 7.7% (-222,000) below its pre-pandemic level. August marks the fifth consecutive month with no growth in self-employment. Chart 2 Self-employment little changed The share of Canadians working from home continues to fall Among workers who worked at least half their usual hours, the proportion working from home fell 1.8 percentage points to 24.0% in August, the lowest share since the onset of the pandemic. Just under half of those working from home (47.3%) reported that their usual work location was outside their home, down from two-thirds (66.8%) during the initial widespread lockdown in April 2020. In addition to employment gains or losses, and changes in work location, the number of people working at different locations may be affected by work absences, which are typically higher during the summer when workers are more likely to be on vacation. Employment rate among youth returns to pre-pandemic level Employment among youth aged 15 to 24 rose 22,000 (+0.9%) in August, entirely in part-time work. Although total youth employment was 41,000 (-1.6%) below its pre-pandemic level in August, the youth employment rate (57.6%)—the proportion of the population aged 15 to 24 who are employed—had essentially returned to its February 2020 level, a result of declines in the size of the youth population. The difference in the labour market outcomes between male and female youth has been notable during much of the pandemic period. Among women aged 15 to 24, employment rose 35,000 (+2.8%) in August. As a result, employment among young women essentially returned to its February 2020 level for the first time. Overall employment among young men dipped slightly below its pre-pandemic level in August (-30,000; -2.3%) after having essentially recovered in July; however, employment rates among both young men (56.0%) and women (56.3%) were on par with pre-pandemic rates. Notable employment gains since May among teens aged 15 to 19 (+140,000; +17.8%) have led to a widening gap in employment recovery between younger and older youth. Among teenagers, employment in August was 50,000 higher (+5.8%) than in February 2020; whereas employment among youth aged 20 to 24 was 92,000 lower (-5.3%). LFS results in the coming months will shed light on whether this trend continues into the fall, with many youth returning to school. Summer student employment lags pre-pandemic level among young women The challenges faced by older youth are also reflected in the labour market outcomes for returning students. From May to August, the LFS collects labour market data on youth aged 15 to 24 who were attending school full time in March and who intend to return to school in the fall. Published data are not seasonally adjusted, therefore comparisons can only be made on a year-over-year basis. For returning students aged 15 to 24, the average employment rate for May to August was 50.3%, 2.0 percentage points lower than the average rate for the summer of 2019 (52.3%), while it was nearly 10 percentage points higher than the rate in the summer of 2020 (40.4%). The average summer employment rate for female students (52.6%) was down 3.6 percentage points from the 2019 summer average (56.2%), mostly due to a notably lower rate in May 2021. In comparison, the rate for male students (47.6%) was little changed from its pre-pandemic level. Younger returning students fared better than older students in the 2021 summer labour market. The average employment rates for returning students aged 15 to 16 (29.3%) and 17 to 19 (57.0%) were essentially on par with those seen in the summer of 2019; while the rate for students aged 20 to 24 (63.0%) was down 5.1 percentage points. The employment rate among female students aged 20 to 24 was furthest from the 2019 summer average, down 7.5 percentage points to 64.3%. Employment growth for core-aged men and older workers Employment for core-aged men (that is, those aged 25 to 54) rose 24,000 (+0.4%) in August, while it was little changed for core-aged women. Among core-aged men, full-time gains (+49,000; +0.8%) more than offset part-time losses (-25,000; -6.1%). Employment for the core-aged population was 84,000 (-0.7%) below its February 2020 level, with similar deficits for men (-47,000) and women (-37,000). Among Canadians aged 55 and older, employment rose 28,000 (+0.7%) in August. Employment for older women remained 39,000 (-2.1%) lower than in February 2020, while employment for older men had returned to its pre-pandemic level in March 2021. Employment rate rises for Filipino Canadians In August, the employment rate increased among Filipino Canadians (+4.6 percentage points to 77.9%). In contrast, the employment rate for Black Canadians was down 3.6 percentage points to 71.8%. Among those who are not members of groups designated as visible minorities and who are not Indigenous, the employment rate (70.8%) was little changed from July (not seasonally adjusted). Employment rate for very recent immigrants continues upward trend The employment rate for very recent immigrants (in Canada for five years or less) continued its upward trend in August, reaching 70.4%, or 6.1 percentage points higher than in August 2019 (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Among immigrants who have been in Canada for more than five years, the employment rate was 58.5% in August, down 1.5 percentage points compared with August 2019. For people born in Canada, the employment rate was 61.4%, down 2.2 percentage points from its pre-COVID level (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). Among Indigenous people, employment rate recovers for both men and women In August, the employment rate among both Indigenous men (60.9%) and women (54.7%) was little changed from August 2019. This marks the first month in which the rate was on par with its pre-pandemic level for Indigenous women, while the rate among Indigenous men had recovered by May 2021. Despite this recovery, employment rates for both Indigenous men and women remained lower than those of their non-Indigenous counterparts, consistent with historical trends. Among non-Indigenous people, the employment rate in August remained lower than two years ago for both men (65.8%; -1.7 percentage points) and women (56.7%; -1.6 percentage points) (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). LFS information for Indigenous people reflects the experience of those who identify as First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, and who live off reserve in the provinces. Unemployment rate at lowest level since February 2020 The unemployment rate fell for the third consecutive month in August, down 0.4 percentage points to 7.1%, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate peaked at 13.7% in May 2020 and has trended downward since, despite some short-term increases during the fall of 2020 and spring of 2021. In the months leading up to the pandemic, the unemployment rate had hovered around historic lows and was 5.7% in February 2020. The adjusted unemployment rate—which includes those who wanted a job but did not look for one—was 9.1% in August, down 0.4 percentage points from one month earlier. Chart 3 Unemployment rate continues downward trend following pandemic-related spikes Drop in unemployment led by core-age men and women aged 55 and older Unemployment among core-aged men fell by 43,000 (-9.3%) in August. The unemployment rate for this group was down 0.6 percentage points to 6.2%, but remained 1.4 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level of 4.8%. For core-age women, unemployment was virtually unchanged in August and their unemployment rate was 5.8%, 1.1 percentage points above the pre-pandemic level. Among people aged 55 and older, unemployment fell by 26,000 (-7.3%) in August, almost entirely among older women. The unemployment rate for older women (6.8%) was 1.8 percentage points higher than in February 2020, while for men (7.7%) it was 2.4 percentage points higher. Unemployment for youth aged 15 to 24 was little changed in August. The unemployment rate for male youth (13.2%) was 1.4 percentage points higher than in February 2020, while the rate for female youth (9.8%) was virtually the same as its pre-pandemic level. Unemployment rate little changed for most visible minority groups The unemployment rate among 15-to-69-year-olds who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities was 9.8% in August, little changed for a second consecutive month (not seasonally adjusted). Chinese Canadians were the sole visible minority group to see a change in their unemployment rate (down 2.3 percentage points to 9.5%; not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, the unemployment rate rose for a second consecutive month among people who were not Indigenous or a visible minority, up 0.5 percentage points to 7.0% (not seasonally adjusted). Number of long-term unemployed declines in August but remains a large proportion of the unemployed Long-term unemployment—the number of people continuously unemployed for 27 weeks or more—dropped 29,000 (-6.7%) to 394,000 in August, but remained 215,000 (+120.0%) higher than in February 2020. The long-term unemployed accounted for 27.4% of all unemployed in August, up from 15.6% just before the onset of the pandemic. Compared with its pre-COVID-19 level, long-term unemployment was up for all age groups in August, including youth aged 15 to 24 (+55.0%); core-aged people aged 25 to 54 (+128.1%); and people aged 55 and older (+143.1%). Among youth and core-aged people, the increase was larger for men than for women, while among older workers the increase was greater for women than it was for men. Among those who had been continuously unemployed for 27 weeks or more in August, one-third (33.7%; 136,000, not seasonally adjusted) had last worked prior to March 2020, and an additional 7.1% (29,000; not seasonally adjusted) had never worked. The remaining 59.2% of the long-term unemployed had lost or left their last job at some point during the pandemic. This includes 24.7% (100,000; not seasonally adjusted) who had last worked in March or April 2020, when the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown resulted in unprecedented employment losses, and 34.5% (140,000; not seasonally adjusted) whose last job ended between May 2020 and February 2021. Chart 4 Among the long-term unemployed, one in four last worked in March or April 2020 Labour market underutilization holds steady The labour underutilization rate was little changed at 14.2% in August. Above and beyond the unemployment rate, this rate reflects the proportion of people in the potential labour force who are unemployed; want a job but have not looked for one; or are employed but working less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19. The number of people searching for work dropped by 81,000 (-5.7%) in August and was the only component of underutilization to decline in the month. Three of the four components of the underutilization rate remained higher than before the pandemic. Compared with February 2020, there were more job searchers (+288,000; +27.7%); more people who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours (+243,000; +29.9%); and more people who wanted a job but who did not look for one (+68,000; +17.2%). The number of people on temporary layoff was virtually the same as it was pre-pandemic. Infographic 1 Labour underutilization little changed in August Participation in the labour force at pre-pandemic levels for most demographic groups The labour force participation rate—the total number of people who are employed or unemployed as a proportion of the population aged 15 and older—is an indicator of the balance between the number of people who are working or looking for work, and the number of people who are pursuing other activities, including studying, caring for family members, and pursuing leisure or voluntary activities. The participation rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 65.1% in August. The rate declined 0.4 percentage points to 91.1% among core-aged men, rose 0.5 percentage points to 65.1% for youth, and was little changed for the other major demographic groups. In recent months, participation rates have returned to what they were before the pandemic among all demographic groups except for among women aged 55 and older, where the August rate (31.5%) remained 1.0 percentage points below its February 2020 level. Job-changing rate increases As the easing of COVID-19 public health restrictions continues, employers face a number of challenges in resuming full business activities. At the same time, workers face their own challenges whether they are returning to their previous industries and occupations, or entering into new fields. During this period of adjustment between labour demand and supply, supplementary measures of labour market churn—the number of people changing employment status or changing jobs—are important complements to concepts such as employment, unemployment and job vacancies. The number of core-aged job leavers—people who left a job voluntarily in the previous 12 months and remained not employed in the LFS reference week—trended down throughout 2020 and early 2021, reaching a record low of 217,000 in April 2021. Since then, the number of job leavers has increased in parallel with improving labour market conditions. This increase continued in August, when the number of job leavers stood at 275,000, up from 257,000 in July (not seasonally adjusted). Despite this increase, the number of job leavers was substantially lower than in August 2019 (-89,000; -24.4%). In addition to job leavers, labour market churn includes job changers (workers who remain employed from one month to the next but who change jobs between months). The job-changing rate has gradually increased over the past year after falling to virtually zero in May 2020 following the initial COVID-19 economic shutdown. The job-changing rate was 0.8% in August, up from 0.6% in July. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the job-changing rate averaged 0.7% over the period from 2016 to 2019, and ranged from 0.6% to 0.8%. Chart 5 Job-changing rate returns to pre-pandemic level Wage growth continues to be influenced by changes in the composition of employment Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicators of wage change have been influenced by the fact that large employment decreases and increases have been proportionately larger among lower-paid workers. Various methods exist to provide a clearer picture of wage trends by removing the effects of changes in the composition of employment. One such method—a fixed-weighted average wage—holds the distribution of employees across occupations and job tenures constant at the 2019 average. Based on the fixed-weighted average, average wages were up 5.2% (+$1.48) in August compared with the 2019 average. Without controlling for compositional changes, actual average wages were 7.1% (+$1.98) higher in August 2021 than in 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 6 Growth in average wages is tempered when job tenure and occupation are held constant Services-producing sector employment returns to pre-COVID level Employment increased in the services-producing sector for the third consecutive month in August (+93,000), led by gains in accommodation and food services (+75,000), and information, culture and recreation (+24,000). Smaller monthly increases were also recorded in professional, scientific and technical services (+15,000), and public administration (+14,000), while employment declined in ""other services"" (-30,000), finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (-17,000), and business, building and other support services (-17,000). The overall gain in August pushed employment in the services-producing sector as a whole back to its pre-COVID level for the first time, although not all industries within the sector have fully recovered. In August, the number of people working in the goods-producing sector was little changed, with gains in construction (+20,000) partially offset by a decline in agriculture (-11,000). Chart 7 Employment in some industries remains further behind despite service-sector recovery Gap with pre-COVID employment remains uneven across the services-producing sector Despite the overall return to pre-COVID employment in the services-producing sector in August, several industries remain further behind in their recovery. In services-producing industries that were deemed essential during the pandemic, or where a high proportion of workers were able to work from home, COVID-related job losses were initially more moderate, and employment is now well above pre-pandemic levels. This includes professional, scientific and technical services (+10.0%; +153,000), public administration (+7.1%; +71,000) and educational services (+5.3%; +73,000). Employment remains below pre-COVID levels in services-producing industries where a higher proportion of jobs involve close contact with others, with accommodation and food services (-12.6%; -154,000) and ""other services"" (-11.1%; -90,000) posting notable gaps in August compared with February 2020. Employment in accommodation and food services at pre-COVID level in two provinces Employment rose by 75,000 (+7.5%) in accommodation and food services in August, with most of the increase concentrated in Ontario. LFS results for August fully capture the reopening of indoor dining in the province, which occurred towards the end of the July LFS reference week. While employment in the industry remains behind pre-pandemic levels in most provinces, the number of workers in accommodation and food services has returned to its pre-COVID level in New Brunswick and Manitoba. More people working in information, culture and recreation In August, employment increased by 24,000 (+3.4%) in information, culture and recreation, with nearly all of the gains in Ontario. Border restrictions on non-essential travel were lifted for fully vaccinated Americans on August 9 and spectator sports began to welcome back live audiences at the beginning of the month. While employment in information, culture and recreation remains 5.7% (-44,000) below its pre-pandemic level nationally, the number of people working in the industry has returned to its February 2020 level in five provinces, including Ontario and British Columbia. Service-sector growth tempered by losses in ""other services"" The number of people working in ""other services,"" which includes religious, grant-making, civic and professional organizations, as well as repair and maintenance services, declined by 30,000 (-4.0%) in August, almost entirely as a result of losses in Ontario and British Columbia. In August, employment also declined in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (-17,000; -1.3%) and business, building and other support services (-17,000; -2.3%). First employment increase in construction since March 2021 Employment in the goods-producing sector was little changed for the second consecutive month. The sector has yet to recoup losses recorded in May and June 2021, and employment remained 3.6% (-142,000) below its pre-COVID level in August. Most of the remaining gap in the sector is attributable to the construction (43.6%) and agriculture (39.9%) industries. The number of people working in construction increased for the first time since March 2021, rising by 20,000 (+1.4%). Nearly all of the gains were in Ontario and British Columbia. Despite the monthly increase, the industry remains 4.2% (-62,000) below the level recorded in February 2020. Employment in agriculture declined by 11,000 (-4.2%) in August. After a partial recovery of COVID-related job losses in late 2020, employment in the industry has declined by 38,000 since November 2020, and was 18.9% (-57,000) below its pre-COVID level in August 2021, proportionally the largest gap among all industries. Businesses in the agriculture industry have faced a number of challenges since the beginning of the pandemic. Fewer agricultural workers entered Canada through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program in 2020 (Agriculture and agri-food labour statistics, 2020) and, more recently, ongoing drought conditions in Western Canada have negatively affected crop growth and yield potential across much of the Prairies (Production of principal field crops, July 2021). Employment up in four provinces Employment increased in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia in August. All other provinces recorded little or no change. For the third consecutive month, British Columbia was the lone province with employment above its pre-pandemic level. Compared with February 2020, the employment gap was largest in Prince Edward Island (-3.4%) and New Brunswick (-2.7%). For further information on key province and industry level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" Employment in Ontario rose for the third successive month (+53,000; +0.7%) in August, nearly all in part-time work. In the Toronto census metropolitan area, employment increased by 73,000 (+2.1%). The additional employment brought overall provincial gains since May 2021 to 242,000 (+3.4%). The accommodation and food services industry contributed the bulk of the employment increase, while educational services, and information, culture and recreation also had notable gains. In contrast, there were notable declines in manufacturing, and ""other services."" For the second consecutive month, the unemployment rate in Ontario fell, dropping 0.4 percentage points to 7.6%. In Alberta, where most public health restrictions were lifted as of July 1, employment rose by 20,000 (+0.9%) in August, the first notable increase since March 2021. Gains were led by transportation and warehousing, followed by information, culture and recreation, and accommodation and food services. The unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage points to 7.9%, the lowest since the pre-pandemic rate of 7.5% in February 2020. In Saskatchewan, employment increased by 10,000 (+1.8%) in August, offsetting losses in June and July. Employment was up in wholesale and retail trade, following losses in June and July. The unemployment rate in Saskatchewan held steady at 7.0%. Employment in Nova Scotia rose by 3,900 (+0.8%) in August, with all of the increase in part-time work. The employment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 56.6%, but remained lower than in February 2020 (57.5%). The unemployment rate dropped 0.6 percentage points to 7.8%. Employment rate remains higher in Canada than in the United States While international comparisons of the pandemic's impact on labour markets are challenging due to differences in concepts, survey design and reference periods, comparisons between the labour market situation in Canada and in the United States can be made by adjusting Canadian data to US concepts. For more information, see ""Measuring Employment and Unemployment in Canada and the United States – A comparison."" A frequent point of comparison between Canada and the United States is the employment rate, defined as the number of people who are employed as a percentage of the working-age population, which is typically higher in Canada. Adjusted to US concepts, and for the population aged 16 and older, the employment rate was 61.0% in Canada and 58.5% in the United States in August. The rate was down 1.4 percentage points from February 2020 in Canada, compared with a drop of 2.6 percentage points in the United States. The unemployment rate, adjusted to US concepts, was 5.8% in Canada in August, 0.6 percentage points higher than in the United States (5.2%). The rate was 1.2 percentage points higher than in February 2020 in Canada, while in the United States it was 1.7 percentage points higher. The labour force participation rate, also adjusted to US concepts, was 64.7% in Canada in August, down 0.7 percentage points from February 2020. In the United States, the participation rate was 61.7%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from February 2020. Looking ahead Over the coming months, labour market conditions may be influenced by ongoing developments, including continuing vaccination efforts, rising COVID-19 cases, the start of a new school year, and the lifting of border restrictions for all fully vaccinated international visitors on September 7. LFS results for the week of September 12 to 18 will be released on October 8.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for August are for the week of August 15 to 21. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). Since March 2020, all LFS face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both respondents and interviewers. While this has resulted in a decline in the LFS response rate, more than 40,000 interviews were completed in August and in-depth data quality evaluations conducted each month confirm that the LFS continues to produce an accurate portrait of Canada's labour market. The suspension of face-to-face interviewing has had a larger impact on response rates in Nunavut than in other jurisdictions. Due to the larger decline in response rates for Nunavut, and resulting changes in the composition of the responding sample, data for Nunavut (table 14-10-0292-01) should be used with caution. To reduce the risks associated with declining data quality for Nunavut, users are advised to use 12-month averages (available upon request) rather than 3-month averages when possible. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the quality of LFS data for Nunavut each month and provide users with updated guidelines as required. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. The distribution of LFS interviews in August 2021 compared with July 2021, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • July 2021: 63.6% • August 2021: 64.1% Online interviews • July 2021: 36.4% • August 2021: 35.9% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. The five occupation groups with the lowest average hourly wages in 2019: sales support occupations; service support and other service occupations, n.e.c.; service supervisors and specialized service occupations; labourers in processing, manufacturing and utilities; and service representatives and other customer and personal services occupations. The five occupation groups with the highest average hourly wages in 2019: professional occupations in natural and applied sciences; occupations in front-line public protection services; middle management occupations in trades, transportation, production and utilities; specialized middle management occupations; senior management occupations. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in August 2021 analysis Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business,' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Information on population groups Since July 2020, the LFS has included a question asking respondents to report the population group(s) to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2021 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, people who identify as a member of a population group (visible minority) are analyzed separately. Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Next release The next release of the LFS will be on October 8, 2021. September data will reflect labour market conditions during the week of September 12 to 18.

Beyond deaths attributed to the disease itself, the pandemic could also have indirect consequences that increase or decrease the number of deaths as a result of various factors, including delayed medical procedures, increased substance use, or declines in deaths attributable to other causes, such as influenza. To understand both the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic, it is important to measure excess mortality, which occurs when there are more deaths than expected in a given period. It should be noted that, even without a pandemic, there is always some year-to-year variation in the number of people who die in a given week. This means that the number of expected deaths should fall within a certain range of values. There is evidence of excess mortality when weekly deaths are consistently higher than the expected number, but especially when they exceed the range of what is expected over several consecutive weeks. From March 2020 to the beginning of June 2021, there were an estimated 23,547 excess deaths in Canada, or 6.7% more deaths than what would be expected were there no pandemic, after accounting for changes in the population, such as aging. Over this same period, 24,910 deaths were directly attributed to COVID-19. While COVID-19 deaths were still observed, significant excess mortality has not been observed nationally for the total population using the provisional death data since February 2021. Building on insights based on excess mortality, age-standardized mortality rates for 2020—which are adjusted to account for changes in population size and age composition—are compared with previous years to better understand how overall mortality trends for certain age groups may have been driven by different causes of death. Overall mortality rates in 2020 increased for all age groups compared with previous years—particularly for the youngest and oldest populations. However, while COVID-19 appeared to be the main driver for increased mortality rates in 2020 among older populations, for younger age groups, increases in unintentional poisonings (which includes overdoses) were also a factor. As part of Statistics Canada's commitment to providing timely and relevant information on COVID-19 and its impact on Canadians, a new updated provisional dataset from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database, covering the period from January 2020 to June 2021, was released today. Updates were also made to the provisional death estimates, which have been adjusted, where possible, to account for the incomplete nature of the counts. The provisional estimates will continue to be revised in future releases, as more information is reported by provincial and territorial vital statistics agencies, and as estimation methods continue to be enhanced. Increased deaths in 2020 reverse a decade of declines in national mortality rates After experiencing years of relatively steady declines in mortality rates, Canada saw a significant increase in the overall age-standardized mortality rate for 2020. Over the past decade, the national overall mortality rate decreased by 7.2%, from 705.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 654.6 in 2019. In 2020, this decline in national age-standardized mortality rates was reversed with a rate of 691.4—the highest overall national age-standardized mortality rate observed in 10 years. Chart 1 Age-standardized mortality rates, all ages, both sexes, Canada, 2011 to 2020 Overall, increases in the mortality rates in 2020 were closely aligned with mortality rates directly attributed to COVID-19. In 2020, the age-standardized mortality rate for deaths due directly to COVID-19 was 35.1 deaths per 100,000 population. This was similar to the increase of 36.8 deaths per 100,000 population in the age-standardized mortality rate from 2019 (654.6) to 2020 (691.4). Analysis of excess mortality trends observed a similar alignment between the number of COVID-19-caused deaths and excess mortality. However, a closer examination reveals that this was not the case for some age groups. For example, 2,992 excess deaths were observed in 2020 in the 0-44 age category, while the same age group experienced fewer than 100 deaths attributed directly to COVID-19 over the same period. Increases in mortality rates among those under the age of 45 are partly explained by increased overdoses Whereas the overall age-standardized mortality rate was steadily declining in the years leading up to the pandemic, the same cannot be said for those in the 0-44 age group. From 2011 to 2015, the mortality rate for this age group stayed relatively stable at around 62 deaths per 100,000 population. However, this rose in subsequent years, peaking at 67.9 in 2017 and then dropping to 64.5 in 2019. This pattern coincided with increased mortality due to unintentional poisonings, which includes deaths associated with overdoses. From 2011 to 2016, the mortality rate for unintentional poisonings in this age group increased from 4.3 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 9.5 in 2016. In 2017, the mortality rate for this cause of death among those younger than 45 peaked at 12.9 deaths per 100,000 population, before the rates started to decline, to a low of 8.3 in 2019. While the overall mortality rate for those younger than 45 was in decline in 2019, this changed in 2020. For this age group, the mortality rate rose 17.4% from 2019 to 75.7 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020—the highest rate observed since 1999. This increase in age-standardized mortality rates among those younger than 45 cannot be fully explained by deaths attributed directly to COVID-19. For this age group, the mortality rate due to COVID-19 was 0.44 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020, which amounted to fewer than 100 deaths attributed directly to the disease. On the other hand, similar to the overall trend for this age group, the age-standardized mortality rate for unintentional poisonings in the 0-44 age group increased by 41% from 2019 to 11.7 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020, reversing the decline observed from 2017 to 2019. Age-standardized mortality rates for 2020 were relatively stable among the natural causes of death that are most common in the 0-44 age group. Cancers (8.0 deaths per 100,000 population) and heart disease (3.2 deaths per 100,000 population) in 2020 remained similar to rates reported in 2018 and 2019. Although cause of death information for all ages is 97% complete for 2020, 22% of the cause of death information on the 0-44 age group remains incomplete, pending additional investigation. Therefore, there is a possibility that the specific cause of death rates reported above may increase as information continues to be reported. Unintentional poisonings and COVID-19 leading to increased mortality rates for those aged 45 to 64 Similar to overall trends, the 45-64 age group had experienced steady declines in age-standardized mortality rates leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting a low of 379.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2019. However, in 2020, the mortality rate for this age group rose to 411.2 deaths per 100,000 population, which was 8.3% higher than in 2019 and the highest rate for this age group since 2012 (412.1). Looking at patterns by cause of death, deaths due to both COVID-19 and unintentional poisonings have contributed to the increase in 2020. The age-standardized mortality rate for COVID-19-caused deaths was 7.8 deaths per 100,000 population for this age group. On the other hand, the mortality rate for unintentional poisonings increased by 35.2% among 45-to-64-year-olds, from 12.5 deaths per 100,000 population in 2019 to 16.9 in 2020. Nearly 8% of the cause of death information for the 45-64 age group in 2020 is incomplete, pending further investigation. Therefore, there is a possibility that the specific cause of death rates reported for this age group may also increase as information becomes more complete. COVID-19 driving increased mortality rates for those aged 65 and older Among those aged 65-84, age-standardized mortality rates had been in steady decline over the years, dropping from 2,490.0 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 2,236.4 deaths per 100,000 population in 2019. In 2020, the rate increased to 2,313.7 deaths per 100,000 population—the highest it has been since 2017. At the same time, the age-standardized mortality rate for COVID-19-caused deaths in 2020 among those in the 65-84 age category was 113.7 deaths per 100,000 population. The fact that the COVID-19 mortality rate is higher than the overall increase in this age group's mortality rate compared with 2019 suggests that rates for other causes of death have declined. In fact, the age-standardized mortality rates for those aged 65-84 for cancer, heart disease and chronic lower respiratory infections have all experienced a steady decline since 2011 and this trend continued in 2020. For those aged 85 and older, from 2011 to 2019, age-standardized mortality rates fluctuated, but generally declined from 12,804.7 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011 to 12,223.7 in 2019. Mortality rates for this age group increased by 5.1% to 12,847.2 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020, marking the highest mortality rate for this age group in Canada since 2010. Similar to the trend for those aged 65-84, the COVID-19 mortality rate for the 85-and-older age group outpaced the overall increase in the mortality rate from 2019 to 2020. The age-standardized mortality rate for COVID-19-caused deaths among individuals aged 85 and older was 982.3 deaths per 100,000 population in 2020. The emergence of COVID-19 variants of concern and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in Canada will likely have an impact on mortality trends. Statistics Canada will continue to provide timely information on a regular basis on excess deaths, causes of death and comorbidities as it becomes available. Note to readers A new updated provisional dataset from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database, covering the period from January 2020 to June 2021, was released today. Updates were also made to the provisional death estimates, which have been adjusted, where possible, to account for the incomplete nature of the counts. The provisional estimates will continue to be revised in future releases as more information is reported by provincial and territorial vital statistics agencies and as estimation methods continue to be enhanced. The data released today are provisional, as they are not based on all deaths that occurred during the reference period because of reporting delays, and they do not include Yukon. Provisional death counts are based on what is reported to Statistics Canada by provincial and territorial vital statistics registries. Provisional death estimates have been adjusted to account for incomplete data, where possible. The numbers of excess deaths discussed in this analysis refer to provisional estimates. Information on the methods used can be found in the ""Definitions, data sources and methods"" section for Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database. The provisional death counts and estimates released today may not match figures from other sources, such as media reports, or counts and estimates from provincial and territorial health authorities and other agencies. There are a number of ways to measure excess mortality, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. There are also a number of challenges with measuring excess mortality, most importantly, properly estimating the number of expected deaths that would occur in a non-COVID-19 context as a comparison basis for the current death counts. Important variations may be observed from year to year in the annual death counts, in particular in the less populated provinces and in the territories. Moreover, yearly death counts may be affected by changes in the composition of the population, in regard to age more particularly, and changes in mortality rates (e.g. improvement of mortality). In the Canadian context, with an aging and growing population, the number of deaths has been steadily increasing over recent years and so a higher number of deaths in 2020 and 2021 would be expected regardless of COVID-19. A second challenge is the difficulty of collecting timely death counts. In Canada, death data are collected by the provincial and territorial vital statistical offices. The capacity to provide death data to Statistics Canada in a timely manner varies greatly. Taking these considerations into account, the method chosen by Statistics Canada—which has also been adopted by organizations in several other countries, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—to estimate expected deaths, is adapted from an infectious disease detection algorithm which has been largely utilized in the context of mortality surveillance in recent years. Rates are a useful tool for comparing characteristics across different populations, different segments of a population, or the same population over time. One type of rate is a percentage, i.e. the number of individuals exhibiting a characteristic or particular behaviour per 100 people. When rates are used to examine unusual events, such as death due to a particular cause, they are often expressed as the number of people or occurrences per 100,000 population in the population. As with percentages, these rates take into account the underlying population size. This article uses age-standardized mortality rates to show the number of deaths per 100,000 population that would have occurred by specified age groups and selected causes of death in Canada if the age structure of the population was the same as the age structure of a specified standard population. The advantage of using age-standardization mortality rates is that they allow for the comparisons across different geographies and over time, because age-standardization removes the effects of differences in the age structure of populations. The standard population used for this analysis was the 2011 population. For more information on age-standardized mortality rates, please consult the Vital Statistics Death Database – Glossary. The tabulation of the causes of death is based on the underlying causes of death, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the disease or injury that initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or as the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause of death is selected from the causes and conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death completed by a medical professional, medical examiner or coroner. More information on causes of death, including the certification and classification of COVID-19 deaths, can be found in the study ""COVID-19 death comorbidities in Canada."" The provisional figures on the number of deaths, the causes of death and excess mortality will continue to be updated as more information is reported to Statistics Canada by the provinces and territories and as further enhancements are made to the estimation models. More information on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is available in the article, ""Excess mortality in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic."" Detailed information on the causes of death in Canada for 2020 will be released on November 26, 2021. References to the period from March 2020 to beginning of June 2021 refer to the period from the week ending March 28, 2020, to the week ending June 5, 2021. References to 2020 are to the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, inclusive. Exceptionally, when discussing the excess mortality and the number of deaths due to COVID-19, the ""2020"" refers to the period from the week ending January 4, 2020 to the week ending January 2, 2021, inclusive. Correction note Some figures included in this release were revised. The analysis focused on age-standardized mortality rates, including breakdowns by broad age group (i.e., under 45, 45-64, 65-84, and 85 and older). All mortality rates were calibrated to 5-year age groups in order to make the comparisons more representative over time. However, the figures broken down by broad age group were calibrated to the total population instead of the population of the broad age group. While this had no impact on the overall mortality rates or any of the trends or analysis, the individual mortality rates by age group required revision to reflect their respective population size. Products To facilitate the identification of trends in excess deaths by province or territory, the product ""Provisional weekly estimates of the number of deaths, expected number of deaths and excess mortality: Interactive Tool"" has been updated. To facilitate the identification of trends in the number of weekly deaths by age group and sex and by province or territory, the product ""Provisional weekly death counts: Interactive tool"" has also been updated.

September Labour Force Survey (LFS) data reflect labour market conditions during the week of September 12 to 18. As of the September reference week, several provinces had introduced, or planned to introduce, proof-of-vaccination requirements to enter non-essential venues such as restaurants, bars and gyms. In addition, masking requirements in indoor public spaces were re-introduced in some regions. Alberta re-introduced an alcohol service curfew at establishments such as restaurants, pubs and bars beginning September 4. In addition, employers in the province were urged to pause return-to-work plans. On September 14, Nova Scotia postponed entering its final phase of reopening. After the Canada-United States border reopened on August 9 for fully vaccinated Americans to enter Canada without quarantine requirements, restrictions on travellers from around the globe were eased on September 7, potentially boosting the arrival of tourists and new immigrants. Highlights Employment regains pre-pandemic level in September, with some notable differences Employment returned to its February 2020 level in September, increasing by 157,000 (+0.8%). The employment rate was 60.9%, 0.9 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The labour force participation rate was 65.5% in September, matching the rate observed in February 2020. Employment among core-aged women (that is, those aged 25 to 54) was 49,000 (+0.8%) above its February 2020 level. Among core-aged men, employment was on par with February 2020. Employment among women aged 55 and older continued to lag February 2020 (-42,000; -2.2%). Employment in occupations not requiring postsecondary education was 287,000 lower in September 2021 than in September 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). The numbers of public- and private-sector employees were at or above February 2020 levels, while self-employment remained 8.4% (-241,000) below its pre-pandemic level. Employment in the services-producing sector surpassed its pre-COVID level in September, while employment in the goods-producing sector remained 3.2% (-128,000) below its February 2020 level. Total hours worked were up 1.1%, but were 1.5% below their pre-pandemic level. The number of people working from home was 4.1 million in September, down from 5.1 million in April 2020. September employment gains were widespread Increases in employment were concentrated in full-time work, and among people in the core working age group of 25 to 54. Employment gains in the month were split between the public-sector (+78,000; +1.9%) and the private-sector (+98,000; +0.8%). Employment increased in six provinces in September: Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan. Service-sector increases (+142,000) were led by public administration (+37,000), information, culture and recreation (+33,000) and professional, scientific and technical services (+30,000). Employment in accommodation and food services fell for the first time in five months (-27,000). While employment in manufacturing (+22,000) and natural resources (+6,600) increased, there was little change in the goods-producing sector overall. Unemployment rate continues downward trend The unemployment rate declined for the fourth consecutive month in September, falling 0.2 percentage points to 6.9%, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. The number of people unemployed was little changed—the decline in the unemployment rate was driven instead by an increase (+139,000) in the number of Canadians participating in the labour market. Long-term unemployment was little changed in September and accounted for 27.3% of all unemployment, up from 15.6% in February 2020. The unemployment rate fell for men aged 55 and older (-0.5 percentage points to 7.2%) and for core-aged women (-0.3 percentage points to 5.5%). The unemployment rate among 15- to 69-year-olds who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities was 7.8%, down 2.0 percentage points from August. Employment regains pre-pandemic level Employment rose by 157,000 (+0.8%) in September, the fourth consecutive monthly increase. The unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points to 6.9%. Employment gains in September were concentrated in full-time work, and among people in the core working age group of 25 to 54. Increases were spread across multiple industries and provinces. The gains in September brought employment back to the same level as in February 2020, just before the onset of the pandemic. However, the employment rate—that is, the proportion of the population aged 15 and older that was employed—was 60.9% in September, 0.9 percentage points lower than in February 2020, due to population growth of 1.4% over the past 19 months. The number of employed people working less than half their usual hours was little changed in September and remained 218,000 higher (+26.8%) than in February 2020. Total hours worked were up 1.1% in September, but were 1.5% below their pre-pandemic level. Chart 1 Employment returns to pre-pandemic level The share of Canadians working from home holds steady in September Among 15- to69-year-olds who worked at least half their usual hours, the proportion working from home was little changed in September at 23.8%. The proportion who worked from home was lowest in Saskatchewan (12.3%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (12.8%), and highest in Ontario (28.7%). Overall, at the national level, the proportion of workers who worked from home was higher in urban areas (25.2%) than in rural areas (15.9%). In September 2021, 4.1 million Canadians who worked at least half their usual hours worked from home, a number similar to the level recorded in September 2020. Over the same period, the number of workers who worked at a location other than home rose by 1 million to 13.2 million. Public- and private-sector employment now at or above pre-pandemic levels Employment gains in September were split between public-sector (+78,000; +1.9%) and private-sector (+98,000; +0.8%) employees. September gains resulted in the number of private-sector employees returning to its pre-pandemic level for the first time, while the number of employees in the public sector was 257,000 (+6.6%) higher than in February 2020. In contrast, self-employment was little changed in the month, remaining 8.4% (-241,000) below its pre-pandemic level. September marks the sixth consecutive month with no growth in self-employment. Among 15- to 69-year-olds who reported receiving a Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) payment in the previous four weeks, 51.0% were either self-employed in September or were not currently working and had last worked as a self-employed worker within the last 12 months. Full-time employment up for women Full-time employment rose by 194,000 (+1.3%) in September and returned to its February 2020 level for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Women saw the majority of the increase in the month, as their full-time employment rose by 154,000 (+2.3%) with gains across a number of industries, including educational services, and healthcare and social assistance. Part-time employment was little changed in September, after having returned to its pre-pandemic level in June 2021. While both full-time and part-time employment have returned to their February 2020 levels, there has been a change in the distribution between men and women. Compared with February 2020, full-time employment among men was down (-107,000; -1.2%) in September, while part-time employment was up (+95,000; +7.5%). In contrast, among women, full-time work was up (+116,000; +1.7%) and part-time work was down (-103,000; -4.5%) over the same period. Despite this shift, women were still more likely to be employed part-time (24.3%) compared with men (13.5%). Employment among core-aged women above pre-pandemic level Among people of core working age (aged 25 to 54), employment increased by 143,000 (+1.2%) in September, with all of the gains in full-time work. Full-time gains for core-aged women (+101,000; +2.1%) were led by increases in the educational services industry and were double the full-time gains for core-aged men (+49,000; +0.8%). September gains brought employment among core-aged women above its February 2020 level (+49,000; +0.8%), and put employment for core-aged men on par with its pre-pandemic level, for the first time. The employment rate for the core-aged population rose 0.9 percentage points to 83.0% in September, and returned to its pre-pandemic level for both core-aged men (86.1%) and core-aged women (79.9%). Among young women aged 15 to 24, employment rose by 17,000 (+1.3%) in September and returned to its February 2020 level for the first time. In contrast, employment among young men aged 15 to 24 was little changed from August and remained 29,000 (-2.2%) below February 2020. The employment rate—the share of the population that is employed—was on par with pre-pandemic rates among both male and female youth. Employment among Canadians aged 55 and older was little changed in September. Among older women, employment continued to lag February 2020 (-42,000; -2.2%), entirely due to shortfalls in part-time work, whereas employment among older men was on par with its pre-pandemic level for the third consecutive month. However, as the population aged 55 and older has grown by 3.3% since February 2020, employment rates have fallen among both older men (-1.2 percentage points to 40.4%) and women (-1.6 percentage points to 29.3%). School year begins for students and parents As of the September reference week, the new school year was underway across the country, affecting the labour market conditions of both students and parents. Almost two-thirds (63.2%) of young Canadians aged 15 to 24 were enrolled in school in September, a proportion similar to September 2019 (62.0%) and September 2020 (62.7%) (not seasonally adjusted). Among youth aged 20 to 24 who were students, about half (51.2%) were employed, little changed from September 2019. In contrast, the employment rate among non-student youth in the same age group was down 1.5 percentage points, to 79.7%, compared with two years earlier (not seasonally adjusted). For parents, the resumption of the school year is typically associated with a rebound in employment rates and hours worked following seasonal declines over the summer. In September, these key labour market indicators were similar to previous Septembers for core-aged mothers whose youngest child was under 13. Compared with September 2019, the employment rate for this group was little changed at 79.4%, while their average hours worked was little changed at 29.3 hours per week (not seasonally adjusted). In contrast, core-aged fathers whose youngest child was under 13 saw a decline in both their employment rate (down 0.7 percentage points to 86.7%) and their average hours worked (down 1.2 hours to 39.0 hours per week) in September 2021 compared with September 2019. Despite these declines among fathers, they remain more likely to be employed and to work more hours per week compared with mothers, consistent with historical trends. During the pandemic, mothers have been more likely than fathers to work from home. In September, nearly one-third (32.5%) of working core-aged mothers whose youngest child was under 13 worked from home, down 2.1 percentage points compared with September 2020. Over the same period, the share of fathers working from home was little changed at 26.9% (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 2 Weekly hours worked for mothers and fathers have followed a similar pattern throughout the pandemic Employment rate increases for Arab Canadians Among those who are not members of groups designated as visible minorities and who are not Indigenous, the employment rate (71.0%) was little changed for the second consecutive month in September. While it was also little changed for most visible minority groups, the employment rate increased among Arab Canadians (+3.6 percentage points to 66.3%). In contrast, the employment rate for South Asian Canadians was down (-2.2 percentage points to 71.4%) (population aged 15 to 69; not seasonally adjusted). Employment rate continues to increase for very recent immigrants The employment rate among very recent immigrants (in Canada for five years or less) continued its upward trend in September, reaching 71.0%—6.0 percentage points higher than in September 2019 (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). While the overall population of newcomers has not grown over the course of the pandemic, the number of very recent immigrants working in some industries has increased. There were more very recent immigrants employed in both professional, scientific, and technical services (+30,000; +37.2%), and in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (+22,000; +52.1%) in September 2021 than in September 2019 (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). These two industries have seen sustained employment growth during the pandemic. Among immigrants who have been in Canada for more than five years, the employment rate was 58.9% in September, down 1.0 percentage points from September 2019. For people born in Canada, the employment rate was 61.2%, down 2.0 percentage points from the same point in time (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). Among Indigenous people, employment rate recovery holds for both men and women In September, the employment rates among both Indigenous men (61.2%) and women (55.4%) were essentially the same as in September 2019. Among men who identify as Métis, the employment rate was 65.7% in September 2021, up 2.4 percentage points compared with two years earlier (not seasonally adjusted). Among non-Indigenous people, the employment rate in September remained lower than two years ago for both men (65.8%; -1.4 percentage points) and women (56.7%; -1.3 percentage points) (three-month moving averages, not seasonally adjusted). Overall, employment rates for both Indigenous men and women remain lower than those of their non-Indigenous counterparts, consistent with historical trends. LFS information for Indigenous people reflects the experience of those who identify as First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, and who live off reserve in the provinces. Unemployment rate continues downward trend The unemployment rate declined for the fourth consecutive month in September, falling 0.2 percentage points to 6.9%, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate peaked at 13.7% in May 2020 and has trended downward since, with some short-term increases during the late fall of 2020 and spring of 2021, coinciding with the tightening of public health restrictions. In the months leading up to the pandemic, the unemployment rate had hovered around historic lows and was 5.7% in February 2020. The adjusted unemployment rate—which includes those who wanted a job but did not look for one—was 8.9% in September, down 0.2 percentage points from one month earlier. The total number of unemployed people was little changed in September and the decline in the unemployment rate was driven instead by an increase of 139,000 (+0.7%) in the number of Canadians participating in the labour market. Chart 3 Unemployment rate falls for the fourth consecutive month Long-term unemployment little changed despite employment growth Long-term unemployment—the number of people continuously unemployed for 27 weeks or more—was little changed in September. There were 389,000 long-term unemployed, more than double (+210,000; +117.0%) the number in February 2020. The long-term unemployed accounted for 27.3% of all unemployed in September, up from 15.6% just before the onset of the pandemic. Among people who had been in long-term unemployment in August, just over 1 in 10 (11.4%) transitioned to employment in September, similar to the pre-COVID average observed from 2017 to 2019. Nearly three-quarters (73.8%) remained unemployed and a further 14.7% had left the labour market by the September LFS reference week (not seasonally adjusted). The ability of the long-term unemployed to transition to employment may be influenced by a number of factors, including their level of education and current labour market conditions. For example, those with no postsecondary education face a labour market where employment in occupations not requiring postsecondary education was 287,000 lower in September 2021 than in September 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). In recent months, those with no postsecondary education have been less likely to transition out of long-term unemployment to employment than those with a university education (12.5% compared with 16.0%) and a higher proportion has left the labour market (20.5% compared with 13.9%) (three-month moving average, not seasonally adjusted). Chart 4 Most long-term unemployed remain unemployed from month to month Unemployment rate falls for older men and core-aged women In September, the unemployment rate fell for men aged 55 and older (-0.5 percentage points to 7.2%) and for core-aged women (-0.3 percentage points to 5.5%). It was little changed for the other major demographic groups. Compared with February 2020, the unemployment rate remained elevated in September for most major demographic groups. For people 55 and older the unemployment rate (7.2%) in September was 2.0 percentage points above its pre-COVID level, with similar increases for women and men. Among core-aged men, the unemployment rate was 1.4 percentage points higher than in February 2020, at 6.2% in September 2021. This was a larger increase than for core-aged women, whose unemployment rate was up 0.8 percentage points to 5.5%. Among youth, the unemployment rate for males aged 15 to 24 was 13.7% in September, up 1.9 percentage points from February 2020. In contrast, the unemployment rate for female youth (8.9%) was little changed from its pre-pandemic level. Unemployment rate falls for most visible minority groups The unemployment rate among people who belong to population groups designated as visible minorities was 7.8% in September, down 2.0 percentage points from August. Declines in the unemployment rate were observed for most visible minority groups, including Chinese (-2.1 percentage points to 7.4%), Black (-1.9 percentage points to 8.9%), Arab (-3.5 percentage points to 8.4%), Latin American (-3.2 percentage points to 8.3%) and Southeast Asian Canadians (-2.4 percentage points to 6.4%) (population aged 15 to 69; not seasonally adjusted). The unemployment rate also fell in September among people who were not Indigenous or a visible minority, down 1.4 percentage points to 5.6% (population aged 15 to 69; not seasonally adjusted). Large increase in labour force participation The labour force participation rate—the total number of people who are employed or unemployed as a proportion of the population aged 15 and older—is an indicator of the balance between the number of people who are working or looking for work, and the number of people who are pursuing other activities, including studying, caring for family members, and pursuing leisure or voluntary activities. The participation rate increased 0.4 percentage points to 65.5% in September, matching the rate observed in February 2020. The participation rate increased for both core-aged women (+0.9 percentage points to 84.5%) and core-aged men (+0.7 percentage points to 91.8%) and was above its pre-pandemic level for both groups. The participation rate also rose among men aged 55 and older (+0.3 percentage points to 43.5%), bringing it to virtually the same level as it was prior to the pandemic. While there was little change in the participation rate among youth in September (65.4%), the rate for this group has hovered around its pre-pandemic level in recent months. The participation rate for women aged 55 and older (31.5%) was virtually unchanged in September, and remained 1.0 percentage points below its February 2020 level. Part of this gap is due to compositional shifts related to population aging, including an increase in the number of women aged 65 and older. Among women aged 55 to 64, the participation rate was 62.0% in September, little changed from February 2020. Labour underutilization remains elevated The labour underutilization rate fell to 13.8% in September, down 0.4 percentage points from August. Above and beyond the unemployment rate, this rate reflects the proportion of people in the potential labour force who are unemployed; want a job but have not looked for one; or are employed but working less than half of their usual hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19. The number of people searching for work dropped by 58,000 (-4.3%) in September and was the only component of underutilization to decline in the month. This decline was partly offset by an increase in the number of people on temporary layoff (+40,000; +35.7%), which ticked up after having returned to its February 2020 level in July. All components of the underutilization rate were higher in September than in February 2020, including job searchers (+231,000; +22.1%); those who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours (+218,000; +26.8%); those who wanted a job but who did not look for one (+56,000; +14.2%); and those on temporary layoff (+46,000; +43.3%). Number of voluntary job leavers remains well below pre-pandemic level As employers and workers continue to adjust to changing labour market conditions, supplementary indicators of labour market churn can be useful complements to standard concepts such as employment and unemployment. The number of core-aged job leavers—people who left a job voluntarily in the previous 12 months and remained not employed in the LFS reference week—stood at 269,000 in September, substantially lower (-119,000; -30.7%) than the September 2019 level of 387,000 (not seasonally adjusted). This is possibly an indication that factors involved in voluntarily leaving a job, such as the ability to relocate or confidence in finding employment in a different field, might be different from what they were before the pandemic. The number of job leavers trended down throughout 2020 and early 2021, and reached a record low of 217,000 in April 2021. The job-changing rate—which measures the proportion of workers who remain employed from one month to the next but who change jobs between months—complements measures of net employment change and flows into and out of employment. The rate was 0.6% in September, compared with 0.8% in August. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the job-changing rate averaged 0.7% over the period from 2016 to 2019, and ranged between 0.6% and 0.8%. Wages up 4.6% over two years, after adjusting for employment composition Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, wage changes have been strongly influenced by unprecedented changes in the composition of employment, including disproportionate decreases in employment in lower-paid occupations and decreases in average tenure (which is the time that employees have been in their current job). A fixed-weighted average wage is one method that paints a picture of wage trends that are less influenced by these changes. Using this approach, which maintains employment composition by occupation and tenure at the 2019 average, average hourly wages were 4.6% (+$1.30) higher in September 2021 than in September 2019. In comparison, and using the same approach, the two-year wage change was +5.2% (+$1.44) in August. Without controlling for changes in the composition of employment, average hourly wages of all employees were 7.3% (+$2.04) higher in September than two years earlier. In August 2021, unadjusted wages had increased 7.8% (+$2.16) on a two-year basis (not seasonally adjusted). Chart 5 Growth in average wages is tempered when job tenure and occupation are held constant Employment growth continues across most of the services-producing sector The number of people working in the services-producing sector increased by 142,000 in September, surpassing its pre-COVID February 2020 employment level for the first time. The increases in September were led by public administration (+37,000), information, culture and recreation (+33,000), and professional, scientific and technical services (+30,000). Despite the services-sector recovery, employment in some industries, including accommodation and food services and ""other services,"" has yet to return to the level observed before the pandemic in February 2020. Employment in accommodation and food services fell for the first time in five months in September (-27,000), a slight reduction to the overall gain of 211,000 recorded from May to August 2021. The number of people working in retail trade also declined (-20,000) in September. While employment in manufacturing (+22,000) and natural resources (+6,600) increased in September, there was little change in the goods-producing sector overall. The sector has seen virtually no growth since the employment loss of 94,000 observed from April to June 2021. Chart 6 Employment in professional, scientific and technical services, and public administration furthest ahead in the recovery Notable employment gains in industries where many workers continue to work from home The number of people working in public administration (+37,000; +3.5%) and professional, scientific and technical services (+30,000; +1.7%) increased for the second consecutive month in September. Employment also rose in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing (+27,000; +2.1%), fully offsetting a decline of 17,000 recorded in the industry in August. The proportion of workers aged 15 to 69 who mostly work from home remained high in all three of these industries in September, ranging from 49.4% in public administration to 60.3% in professional, scientific and technical services. The employment increase in public administration in September coincides with a gain (+13,000, not seasonally adjusted) among survey interviewers and statistical clerks in the federal public administration subsector—the occupational group which includes election enumerators and poll clerks. Advance polls for the 2021 federal election were open at the beginning of the LFS reference week. Compared with pre-COVID February 2020 employment levels, professional, scientific, and technical services (+183,000; +11.9%) and public administration (+108,000; +10.8%) lead all industries in the recovery, with finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing slightly further behind (+76,000; +6.1%). Workers in information, culture and recreation back to pre-pandemic level Employment in information, culture and recreation increased for the second consecutive month, rising 33,000 (+4.5%) in September. The combined August and September gain of 56,000 has pushed employment in the industry back to its February 2020 level for the first time. Nearly all of the gains since August have been in Ontario. Most provinces have allowed festivals, as well as sporting events and recreational facilities, to resume operation since July, but employment in information, culture and recreation remains below pre-pandemic levels in five provinces, with the largest gap, in percentage terms, in Nova Scotia. Employment of program leaders and instructors in recreation, sport and fitness, one of the occupational groups most affected by COVID-related employment losses, remains 17,000 lower than in September 2019 (not seasonally adjusted). Employment in accommodation and food services declines for the first time since April After increasing by 211,000 from May to August, the number of people working in accommodation and food services fell by 27,000 (-2.5%) in September, mostly due to a decline in Ontario. While employment in this industry typically decreases from August to September on a seasonally unadjusted basis, the unadjusted decline between these two months was larger than usual in 2021. With the September loss, overall employment in accommodation and food services was 14.8% (-180,000) below its February 2020 level. Fewer people working in retail trade in September Employment fell by 20,000 (-0.9%) in retail trade, bringing employment in the industry to 3.1% (-71,000) below its February 2020 level. Despite the easing of many restrictions across Canada, employment in the industry has hovered around the same level since June. Also, data on business openings and closures show that the total number of active businesses in the industry has shown little growth in 2021 and was 2.7% below its February 2020 level as of June 2021. Employment gains resume in educational services After recording little change in July and August, employment grew by 21,000 (+1.5%) in educational services in September, largely as a result of gains in British Columbia. Many schools across Canada returned to full-time in-person learning in September. Nationally, employment in educational services was up 6.8% (+94,000) compared with its February 2020 level. The number of people working in transportation and warehousing returns to February 2020 level Employment in the transportation and warehousing industry rose by 17,000 (+1.7%) in September and returned to its February 2020 level for the first time. The monthly gains were largely concentrated in Ontario and Quebec. The composition of jobs within the industry has shifted since the period before the pandemic. Compared with September 2019, employment in the industry has increased among mail and message distribution occupations (+19,000) and declined in occupations in travel and accommodation (-12,000) (not seasonally adjusted). Period of little growth persists for goods-producing sector For the third consecutive month, there was little change in the number of people working in goods-producing industries overall. Employment in the sector remains 93,000 below the recent high recorded in March 2021, and 3.2% (-128,000) below its pre-COVID February 2020 level. Employment in natural resources rose by 6,600 (+2.0%), with most of the gains attributable to Quebec. The number of people working in the industry has hovered around the same level since April 2021, but remains 7.0% (+22,000) above its pre-pandemic February 2020 level. The manufacturing industry recorded its first employment gain since December 2020, rising by 22,000 (+1.3%) in September. The increase, almost entirely in Quebec, brought employment in the industry back up to its pre-COVID February 2020 level. Employment up in six provinces Employment increased in six provinces in September: Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan. There was little change in Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and British Columbia. British Columbia was the lone province with employment notably above its pre-pandemic level. For further information on key province and industry level labour market indicators, see ""Labour Force Survey in brief: Interactive app."" Employment in Ontario rose for the fourth consecutive month (+74,000; +1.0%) in September, all in full-time work. In the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), employment increased by 39,000 (+1.1%). The additional employment brought overall provincial gains since May 2021 to 316,000 (+4.4%). Employment increased in information, culture and recreation, and in finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing, while it declined in accommodation and food services. The unemployment rate fell for the fourth consecutive month, down 0.3 percentage points to 7.3% in September. Employment in Quebec rose by 31,000 (+0.7%) in September after holding steady in July and August. Gains were led by manufacturing, followed by professional, scientific and technical services. The unemployment rate in September was 5.7%. In the Montréal CMA, employment was little changed in September following a decline of 29,000 (-1.3%) in August. The Québec CMA posted the lowest unemployment rate of all CMAs in Canada, at 4.1% in September. In Alberta, employment rose by 20,000 (+0.9%) in September, the second consecutive notable increase since March 2021. Gains were mostly in wholesale and retail trade. The unemployment rate was 8.1%, still above the pre-pandemic rate of 7.5% in February 2020. In September, there were 7,800 (+1.2%) more employed Manitobans, the second increase in three months. Gains in September were in part-time work, and nearly all among women aged 25 and older and men aged 25 to 54. The unemployment rate was little changed at 5.6%. Following four months of little change, employment in New Brunswick rose by 6,100 (+1.7%) in September, mainly in full-time work. The unemployment rate was 9.3% in September, unchanged for the third consecutive month. In Saskatchewan, employment increased by 5,300 (+0.9%) in September, the second consecutive monthly gain. The increase in September was nearly all in part-time work. The unemployment rate decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 6.3%. Quarterly update for the territories After a decrease in the second quarter of 2021, employment in Yukon held steady at 21,700 for the three months ending in September. The employment rate was 66.0%, also little changed and the unemployment rate was 6.1%. Employment in the Northwest Territories was stable at 23,300 for the three months ending in September, compared with the quarter ending in June. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.5% and the employment rate was 68.7%. Employment in Nunavut averaged 11,100 for the 12 months ending September, and the employment rate was 48.5%. The unemployment rate was 9.1%. Looking ahead In September, employment reached its February 2020 level for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the employment rate remained 0.9 percentage points lower than in February, a reflection of the fact that employment growth has not fully matched population growth over the past 19 months. Entering the fall, the Canadian labour market continues to face a number of challenges and uncertainties, including some industries still looking to fully resume their activities, while others expand and recruit new talent; people in the ranks of the long-term unemployed seeking to find their way back to employment; as well as both employers and workers adjusting to proof-of-vaccination initiatives. LFS results for the week of October 10 to 16 will be released on November 5.

The plan is based on 17 specific sustainable development goals. The Labour Force Survey is an example of how Statistics Canada supports the reporting on the Global Goals for Sustainable Development. This release will be used in helping to measure the following goals: Note to readers The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates for September are for the week of September 12 to 18. The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends observed over longer time periods. For more information, see ""Interpreting Monthly Changes in Employment from the Labour Force Survey."" This analysis focuses on differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 68% confidence level. LFS estimates at the Canada level do not include the territories. The LFS estimates are the first in a series of labour market indicators released by Statistics Canada, which includes indicators from programs such as the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH); Employment Insurance Statistics; and the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. For more information on the conceptual differences between employment measures from the LFS and those from the SEPH, refer to section 8 of the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (Catalogue number71-543-G). Since March 2020, all LFS face-to-face interviews have been replaced by telephone interviews to protect the health of both respondents and interviewers. While this has resulted in a decline in the LFS response rate, 40,000 interviews were completed in September and in-depth data quality evaluations conducted each month confirm that the LFS continues to produce an accurate portrait of Canada's labour market. The suspension of face-to-face interviewing has had a larger impact on response rates in Nunavut than in other jurisdictions. Due to the larger decline in response rates for Nunavut, and resulting changes in the composition of the responding sample, data for Nunavut (table 14-10-0292-01) should be used with caution. To reduce the risks associated with declining data quality for Nunavut, users are advised to use 12-month averages (available upon request) rather than 3-month averages when possible. Statistics Canada will continue to monitor the quality of LFS data for Nunavut each month and provide users with updated guidelines as required. In addition, all telephone interviews were conducted by interviewers working from their home and none were done from Statistics Canada's call centres. The distribution of LFS interviews in September 2021 compared with August 2021, was as follows: Telephone interviews – from interviewer homes • August 2021: 64.1% • September 2021: 62.9% Online interviews • August 2021: 35.9% • September 2021: 37.1% The employment rate is the number of employed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. The rate for a particular group (for example, youths aged 15 to 24) is the number employed in that group as a percentage of the population for that group. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed). The participation rate is the number of employed and unemployed people as a percentage of the population aged 15 and older. Full-time employment consists of persons who usually work 30 hours or more per week at their main or only job. Part-time employment consists of persons who usually work less than 30 hours per week at their main or only job. Total hours worked refers to the number of hours actually worked at the main job by the respondent during the reference week, including paid and unpaid hours. These hours reflect temporary decreases or increases in work hours (for example, hours lost due to illness, vacation, holidays or weather; or more hours worked due to overtime). In general, month-to-month or year-to-year changes in the number of people employed in an age group reflect the net effect of two factors: (1) the number of people who changed employment status between reference periods, and (2) the number of employed people who entered or left the age group (including through aging, death or migration) between reference periods. Supplementary indicators used in September 2021 analysis Employed, worked zero hours includes employees and self-employed who were absent from work all week, but excludes people who have been away for reasons such as 'vacation,' 'maternity,' 'seasonal business,' and 'labour dispute.' Employed, worked less than half of their usual hours includes both employees and self-employed, where only employees were asked to provide a reason for the absence. This excludes reasons for absence such as 'vacation,' 'labour dispute,' 'maternity,' 'holiday,' and 'weather.' Also excludes those who were away all week. Not in labour force but wanted work includes persons who were neither employed, nor unemployed during the reference period and wanted work, but did not search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Unemployed, job searchers were without work, but had looked for work in the past four weeks ending with the reference period and were available for work. Unemployed, temporary layoff or future starts were on temporary layoff due to business conditions, with an expectation of recall, and were available for work; or were without work, but had a job to start within four weeks from the reference period and were available for work (don't need to have looked for work during the four weeks ending with the reference week). Labour underutilization rate (specific definition to measure the COVID-19 impact) combines all those who were unemployed with those who were not in the labour force but wanted a job and did not look for one; as well as those who remained employed but lost all or the majority of their usual work hours for reasons likely related to COVID-19 as a proportion of the potential labour force. Potential labour force (specific definition to measure the impact of COVID-19) includes people in the labour force (all employed and unemployed people), and people not in the labour force who wanted a job but didn't search for reasons such as 'waiting for recall (to former job),' 'waiting for replies from employers,' 'believes no work available (in area, or suited to skills),' 'long-term future start,' and 'other.' Information on population groups Since July 2020, the LFS has included a question asking respondents to report the population group(s) to which they belong. Possible responses, which are the same as in the 2021 Census, include: • White • South Asian e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan • Chinese • Black • Filipino • Arab • Latin American • Southeast Asian e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai • West Asian e.g., Iranian, Afghan • Korean • Japanese • Other According to the Employment Equity Act, visible minorities are ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" In the text, people who identify as a member of a population group (visible minority) are analyzed separately. Seasonal adjustment Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted estimates, which facilitate comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. The seasonally adjusted data for retail trade and wholesale trade industries presented here are not published in other public LFS tables. A seasonally adjusted series is published for the combined industry classification (wholesale and retail trade). Next release The next release of the LFS will be on November 5, 2021. October data will reflect labour market conditions during the week of October 10 to 16, 2021.

The Indigenous population in Canada, which includes First Nations, Métis and Inuit, was estimated at 1,800,000 in 2016, and could reach 2,495,000 in 2041 under the low-growth scenario, 2,848,000 under the medium-growth scenario, and 3,182,000 under the high-growth scenario. These projections are based on data from the 2016 Census, which were adjusted to account for, among other things, census net undercoverage and the population living on incompletely enumerated Indian reserves and Indian settlements. Because of these adjustments, the figures presented here for 2016 may differ from those obtained directly from the 2016 Census. From 2016 to 2041, the Indigenous population is projected to grow faster than the non-Indigenous population, despite the fact that the non-Indigenous population would increase resulting from sustained international migration. As a result, the share of the Indigenous population in the overall Canadian population could range from 5.4% to 6.8% in 2041, compared with 5.0% in 2016. Two main factors are behind the higher growth of the Indigenous population in the coming years: higher fertility and changes in the self-reporting of Indigenous identity over a person's lifetime, with some individuals newly self-identifying as Indigenous in the census, a trend that has continued over time. Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the projections of Indigenous populations When these projections were being developed, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the growth of Indigenous populations was either very uncertain, hardly noticeable, or fairly insignificant, depending on the component. For these reasons, these projections do not include special adjustments to reflect the influence of the pandemic. A population that is projected to remain younger Throughout the projection period, the Indigenous population is projected to remain younger than the non-Indigenous population, but to age more quickly. The median age of the Indigenous population, which was 29.1 years in 2016, is projected to range from 38.2 to 38.4 years in 2041. In comparison, that of the non-Indigenous population is projected to increase from 41.4 to 44.7 years over the same period. The aging of the Indigenous population would be attributed to an increase in life expectancy and to projected levels of fertility that are projected to be lower than the average observed in recent decades. Note that changes in the self-reporting of Indigenous identity over a person's lifetime, which partly drive the growth of the Indigenous population, would have little impact on the aging of this population. One in five people could be Indigenous in Manitoba in 2041 Similar to the projected population growth at the Canadian level, the Indigenous population is projected to increase in all provinces and territories from 2016 to 2041. Three provinces could have more than 400,000 Indigenous people in 2041: Ontario (ranging from 574,000 to 762,000), Alberta (ranging from 429,000 to 526,000), and British Columbia (ranging from 406,000 to 507,000). In 2016, only Ontario (406,000) exceeded this threshold. As in 2016, Manitoba and Saskatchewan could be the two provinces with the highest proportion of Indigenous people in their population in 2041. The proportion of Indigenous people in Manitoba is projected to range from 19.3% to 22.5% (18.3% in 2016), while in Saskatchewan, it is projected to range from 16.5% to 19.0% (16.6% in 2016). Indigenous people are projected to continue to represent a large proportion of the population of the territories in 2041: ranging from 87.3% to 88.5% of the population of Nunavut, from 46.0% to 48.7% of the population of the Northwest Territories, and from 20.4% to 22.4% of the Yukon population. In 2016, the comparable figures were 85.7%, 50.6% and 23.4%, respectively. The Indigenous population is projected to also increase in all census metropolitan areas from 2016 to 2041. In 2041, Winnipeg (ranging from 132,000 to 159,000), Edmonton (from 127,000 to 155,000), Vancouver (from 91,000 to 120,000), Toronto (from 81,000 to 110,000), Montréal (from 68,000 to 106,000), Calgary (from 79,000 to 102,000) and Ottawa–Gatineau (from 58,000 to 85,000) are projected to have the largest Indigenous populations in Canada, as was the case in 2016. As a proportion of the total population, it is in Thunder Bay (ranging from 18.1% to 22.3%), Greater Sudbury (from 14.1% to 18.3%), Winnipeg (from 11.9% to 14.2%), Saskatoon (from 9.4% to 11.5%) and Brantford (from 9.1% to 11.4%) that proportions of Indigenous people are projected to be the highest in 2041, a picture similar to that seen in 2016. The First Nations population could reach 1.5 to 1.8 million by 2041 In 2016, the First Nations population was 1,072,000. Based on all selected scenarios, this population is projected to increase continuously by 2041. The First Nations population could range from 1,459,000 to 1,786,000 people in 2041, representing from 56.1% to 58.5% of the total Indigenous population in Canada. From 2016 to 2041, the increase in the First Nations population is projected to be proportionately greater than that of the non-Indigenous population. This is reflected in the projected average annual growth rate ranging from 1.2% to 2.1% for the First Nations population, compared with about 1.0% for the non-Indigenous population. This faster increase in the First Nations population is projected to be mainly due to two factors: relatively high fertility and, to a lesser extent, changes in the self-reporting of Indigenous identity over a person's lifetime, the net number of which would be favourable for the growth of the First Nations population. As with the Indigenous population as a whole, the First Nations population is projected to age throughout the projected period. In 2016, the median age of this population was 27.2 years, while in 2041, it could range from 36.0 to 36.5 years. This aging would mostly be due to an increase in life expectancy and continued below-replacement fertility levels. Based on all selected scenarios, the First Nations population is projected to increase in all provinces and territories by 2041. In 2016, Ontario (262,000) had the largest number of First Nations people, followed by British Columbia (187,000) and Alberta (152,000). In 2041, Ontario (ranging from 358,000 to 449,000), British Columbia (from 249,000 to 301,000), and Alberta (from 224,000 to 272,000) are projected to continue to have the largest First Nations populations. Population with Registered or Treaty Indian status In these projections, the population with Registered or Treaty Indian status includes people who reported having Registered or Treaty Indian status in the census. Based on all selected scenarios, the size of the population with Registered or Treaty Indian status is projected to increase from 2016 to 2041. Therefore, this population, which was estimated at 910,000 people in 2016, is projected to range from 1,120,000 to 1,425,000 in 2041. High fertility and changes to the Indian Act in recent years, which would enable more people to apply for Registered Indian Status during the projection, would be the main drivers of this growth. From 2016 to 2041, the average annual growth rate for this population is projected to range from 0.8% to 1.8%, compared with about 1.0% for the non-Indigenous population. In 2041, from 439,000 to 485,000 Registered or Treaty Indians are projected to live on reserve, compared with 386,000 in 2016. As a proportion, 42.4% of the population with Registered or Treaty Indian status lived on reserve in 2016. This proportion is projected to decline, ranging from 34.0% to 39.2% in 2041. Consequently, the population of Registered or Treaty Indians is projected to increase more quickly off reserve. The main reasons for this result are legislative changes that would enable more people, living mainly off reserve, to apply for Registered Indian status, and negative net migration of reserves. In 2016, Manitoba and Ontario were the two provinces with the largest number of Registered or Treaty Indians living on reserve, given that each of them had 69,000. However, at the end of the projection in 2041, the populations of Registered or Treaty Indians living on reserve are projected to be largest in Manitoba (ranging from 79,000 to 88,000) and in British Columbia (ranging from 75,000 to 82,000). The population with Registered or Treaty Indian status is projected to remain younger on reserve than off reserve. In 2041, the median age is projected to range from 34.1 to 35.7 years (25.6 years in 2016) for the Registered or Treaty Indian population living on reserve, compared with a median age ranging from 39.7 to 40.8 years (29.9 years in 2016) for the population living off reserve. The Métis population could exceed one million by 2041 The Métis population, which has grown quickly in recent decades, could exceed one million in the coming years. From 615,000 people in 2016, this population could range from 883,000 to 1,152,000 by 2041, which could represent from 35.4% to 37.0% of the total Indigenous population. From 2016 to 2041, the Métis population is projected to grow faster than the non-Indigenous population. This faster growth would be largely due to changes in the self-reporting of Indigenous identity over a person's lifetime, which would be largely in favour of the Métis population. The average annual growth rate for the Métis population from 2016 to 2041 is projected to range from 1.5% to 2.5%, compared with about 1.0% for the non-Indigenous population. Over the next few years, the Métis population is projected to age. In 2041, the median age of this population is projected to range from 42.3 to 42.5 years, compared with 33.0 years in 2016. The increase in life expectancy and a fertility level similar to that of the non-Indigenous population would be the reasons for this projected aging. The growth of the Métis population as a result of changes in self-reported identity is projected to contribute marginally to the aging of this population. From 2016 to 2041, based on all selected scenarios, the Métis population is projected to grow in all provinces and territories. In 2041, as in 2016, the largest Métis populations are projected to be in Ontario (ranging from 192,000 to 261,000) and Alberta (from 191,000 to 226,000). However, as in 2016, the proportion of Métis in the total population is projected to be highest in Manitoba (ranging from 7.0% to 8.1%) and Saskatchewan (from 5.1% to 5.9%) in 2041. In these projections, the Métis population refers to those who self-identified as Métis in the 2016 Census. It is important to note that a new question was added to the 2021 Census to allow Métis to identify themselves further, opening up possibilities for more detailed analyses of this population in the future. In particular, it will be possible to produce estimates and projections by membership in a Métis organization or settlement. The Inuit population could reach nearly 100,000 by 2041 The Inuit population is projected to increase from 2016 to 2041 and could reach nearly 100,000 by 2041. Based on various scenarios, this population, which was estimated at 67,000 in 2016, is projected to range from 92,000 to 101,000 in 2041, which would represent from 3.2% to 3.7% of the total Indigenous population in Canada. From 2016 to 2041, the average annual rate of increase in the Inuit population is projected to range from 1.2% to 1.6%, a higher rate than that expected for the non-Indigenous population (+1.0%). This higher projected growth in the Inuit population is mainly due to its fertility, which is projected to remain well above that of the non-Indigenous population and the replacement level. The age structure of the Inuit population is particularly young. The median age of the Inuit population in 2016 was 24.6 years, compared with 41.4 for the non-Indigenous population. By 2041, the Inuit population is projected to remain significantly younger than the non-Indigenous population but would still age. In 2041, the median age of the Inuit population is projected to range from 30.0 to 31.8 years (compared with 44.7 years for the non-Indigenous population). The projected increase in the median age of the Inuit population would be largely due to increased life expectancy. Historically, Inuit have always been the main inhabitants of Canada's Arctic regions and, in that respect, they differ from the rest of the population, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. In 2016, 72.7% of Inuit lived in one of the four Inuit Nunangat regions (Nunavut, Nunavik [northern Quebec], the Inuvialuit region of the Northwest Territories, and Nunatsiavut [northern Labrador]). In 2041, the picture would be similar, since this proportion is projected to range from 74.0% to 74.6% based on all selected scenarios. From 2016 to 2041, the Inuit population is projected to increase in each of the four regions of Inuit Nunangat, but the average annual growth rate is projected to be much lower in Nunatsiavut (ranging from +0.1% to +0.5%) than in the other three regions of Inuit Nunangat (from +1.4% to +1.7% in Nunavut; from +1.4% to +1.8% in Nunavik; and from +1.5% to +1.9% in the Inuvialuit region). In 2041, Nunavut is projected to remain the region of Inuit Nunangat with the largest Inuit population in Canada (ranging from 44,000 to 48,000). In these projections, the Inuit population refers to those who self-identified as Inuit in the 2016 Census. It is important to note that a new question was added to the 2021 Census to allow Inuit to identify themselves further, opening up possibilities for more detailed analyses of this population in the future. In particular, it will be possible to produce estimates and projections by enrolment under an Inuit land claims agreement. Note to readers This release presents new demographic projections developed by Statistics Canada with financial support from Indigenous Services Canada. These projections were generated using Demosim, Statistics Canada's microsimulation demographic projection model. These projections are not predictions, but rather an effort to provide a picture of what Indigenous populations may be in the years to come under various growth scenarios. The scenarios developed provide a plausible range of Indigenous population growth based on our knowledge of these populations. The reader is asked to consider this range instead of a single scenario. For this projection exercise, three scenarios were developed regarding the growth of Indigenous populations: a low-growth, medium-growth and high-growth scenario. These scenarios are designed to address the uncertainty surrounding the various factors of Indigenous population growth, primarily the future evolution of fertility and mortality, changes in the self-reporting of Indigenous identity over a person's lifetime, and registrations on the Indian Register. The low-growth scenario combines the low assumptions for each of these four components, the medium-growth scenario, the medium assumptions, and the high-growth scenario, the high assumptions. To compare Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, the various assumptions involving Indigenous people in each scenario were combined with a series of assumptions corresponding to a medium growth of the non-Indigenous population. Finally, it should be noted that the results of the projections of Indigenous households are also released for the period from 2016 to 2041. Products The report ""Projections of the Indigenous populations and households in Canada, 2016 to 2041: Overview of data sources, methods, assumptions and scenarios"" is also available. Five infographics were developed, one for each of the following population groups: Total Indigenous population (Catalogue number11-627-m2021066); First Nations people (Catalogue number11-627-m2021067); Métis (Catalogue number11-627-m2021068); Inuit (Catalogue number11-627-m2021069); Registered or Treaty Indians (Catalogue number11-627-m2021070). Each infographic presents results based on a selection of indicators at the 2041 horizon. An interactive data visualization tool (Catalogue number71-607-x2021022) can also be used to explore projection results regarding Indigenous populations in a dynamic manner. The base data for this tool are those from the two Common Output Data Repository tables, both of which present the projected size of the Indigenous populations. The first table (table 17-10-0144-01) is broken down using an Indigenous identity classification that gives precedence to Indigenous groups, while the second table (table 17-10-0145-01) is broken down using an Indigenous identity classification that gives precedence to Registered or Treaty Indian status (see the ""Key concepts related to Indigenous populations"" section in the report for more details regarding these classifications). In both cases, the projected population figures are broken down by age group, sex, region of residence, provinces and territories, and projection scenario for years 2016 to 2041.

Although most provinces reported increases, notable declines in Ontario and British Columbia pulled the national results lower compared with July. On a constant dollar basis (2012=100), the total value of building permits fell 1.3%. Chart 1 Total value of building permits, seasonally adjusted Infographic 1 Building permits, August 2021 Residential permits continue to trend down since March peak Residential permits decreased 8.3% to $6.4 billion in August, the lowest level since March. Ontario and British Columbia drove most of the decline. Construction intentions for multi-family units fell 15.9%, largely reflecting Ontario's decline (-24.3%). This was despite the approval of high value condominium projects in the city of Toronto. In contrast, single family intentions were up slightly (+1.2%), led by a 15.7% gain in Quebec. Additionally, Newfoundland and Labrador (+0.7%) reported the first provincial increase in this component after six consecutive monthly declines. Chart 2 Value of building permits for the single-family and multi-family components Chart 3 Value of building permits for the residential and non-residential sectors Non-residential permits up in August Non-residential building permits rose 12.3% to $3.3 billion, led by higher construction intentions in Quebec and Alberta. Commercial building permits were up 14.9% nationally, supported by Ontario's third consecutive month of growth. A 10-storey office building permit in the city of North York contributed to Ontario's gains. The value of institutional building permits rose 21.9% in August. Much of this growth came from Quebec (+78.0%), largely reflecting a $116 million permit for an expansion of a hospital building in the city of Verdun. Construction intentions for industrial buildings decreased 7.3% to $543 million in August. Nova Scotia reported the largest monthly percentage decrease (-90.9%), following a strong July which included a $40 million utility building permit issued by the city of Halifax.

Table 1 Dwelling units, value of residential and non-residential building permits, Canada – Seasonally adjusted Table 2 Value of building permits, by province and territory – Seasonally adjusted Table 3 Value of building permits, by census metropolitan area – Seasonally adjusted Note to readers Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally adjusted data with current dollar values, which facilitate month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter comparisons by removing the effects of seasonal variations. For information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonally adjusted data – Frequently asked questions. Starting with the March 2021 reference period, monthly constant dollar estimates are available for the entire data series (34-10-0066-01). Constant dollars remove the effects of price changes over time and are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0135-01). Typically, the first two months of a quarter use the previous quarter's price level and are revised when the new quarterly price index becomes available. Building components Single-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing only one dwelling unit (e.g., single-detached house, bungalow, linked home [linked at the foundation]). Multi-family dwellings: Residential buildings containing multiple dwelling units (e.g., apartment, apartment condominium, row house, semi-detached house). Industrial buildings: Buildings used in the processing or production of goods, or related to transportation and communication. Commercial buildings: Buildings used in the trade or distribution of goods and services. Institutional and government buildings: Buildings used to house public and semi-public services, such as those related to health and welfare, education, or public administration, as well as buildings used for religious services. Revision Unadjusted data for the current reference month are subject to revision based on late responses. Data for the previous month have been revised. Seasonally adjusted data for the previous two months have also been revised. Trend-cycle estimates have been added to the charts as a complement to the seasonally adjusted series. Both seasonally adjusted data and trend-cycle estimates are subject to revision as additional observations become available. These revisions could be large and could even lead to a reversal of movement, especially at the end of the series. The higher variability associated with trend-cycle estimates is indicated with a dotted line on the chart. For information on trend-cycle data, see the StatCan Blog and Trend-cycle estimates – Frequently asked questions. Next release Data on building permits for September will be released on November 2, 2021.
