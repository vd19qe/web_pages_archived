Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone.

Although it is encouraging that some political leaders are undertaking positive, constructive action to fight the Covid19 menace, it does beg the question as to why the federal government is not implementing policies it claims to support in key areas of its jurisdiction. As has been the hallmark of the Trudeau government during its almost five year term to date, there have been many high-profile announcements of virus-related measures the federal government said it was planning to take, only to have little if any actual follow-up to implement these measures. Border controls have been a prime example. For weeks now, Canadians have been told that there are stringent measures in place in airports and other border points to ensure people coming into Canada – many from COVID-19 hotspots around the world – are being adequately screened and quarantined as needed. Last week, British Columbia Health Minister Adrian Dix’s frustration boiled over and he publicly aired his complaints regarding the lack of federal action to provide direction and follow-up on COVID-19 policies as they apply to people returning to Canada in airports, on cruise ships and other border points. Dix emphasized the need for more rigid enforcement of quarantines, and asked that the federal government provide the province with full information on people returning to Canada and the ability of the province to follow-up in the absence of the federal government living up to its responsibilities. BC Premier Horgan has on several occasions called on the federal government to “up its game” on pandemic-related border measures. Other reports have shown that Quebec, Alberta and Nova Scotia have been sending officers to airports to tighten up controls as it became clear the feds were not living up to their commitments. Alberta is another province that is stepping in to offset federal inaction. After being frustrated with slow progress at Health Canada, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney recently instructed his officials to consider using various COVID-19 tests, vaccines or other medications that have already been approved by credible health agencies in other countries without waiting for Health Canada approval.

League Standings Local Province to Use Data Driven Approach to Staged Re-Opening of Economy Instead of a hard date many had expected, Premier Ford along with several key ministers outlined criteria that Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health experts will use as a basis to begin a staged reopening of Ontario. Officials must first see a consistent two-to-four week decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases, confirmation that Ontario has sufficient acute and critical care capacity within the healthcare system, and ensuring local public health officials are in touch with 90% of new COVID-19 contacts within one day before advising the provincial government to begin loosening emergency measures. “Our top priority remains protecting the health and safety of the people of Ontario and supporting our frontline heroes as we do everything in our power to contain and defeat this deadly virus,” said Premier Ford. “At the same time, we are preparing for the responsible restart of our economy. The next phase of our response to COVID-19 is designed to help us map out what needs to be done, and when, to get us back on the road to recovery. Once the criteria have been met, the reopening of Ontario will occur over three stages while maintaining current physical distancing practices, hand washing, and current protections for vulnerable populations. The first stage plans for certain closed businesses to reopen with modified operations meeting public health guidance, opening some outdoor spaces like parks, and increasing the number of individuals permitted to gather. Scheduled non-urgent surgeries along with other health care services would begin as well. The second stage includes the opening of more workplaces, based on risk assessments and may include service industries and additional office and retail workplaces. Further relaxation of larger public gathering restrictions would continue. The third stage would see remaining workplaces open and the continued removal of public gathering restrictions. “Turning on an economy after an unprecedented shut-down is not as simple as flipping a switch,” said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. “We need to plan this out carefully to ensure we do not spark a sudden outbreak, undo the progress we have made and put the safety of the public at risk.” The Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, chaired by Minister Phillips and contains members of the Ontario cabinet representing the various areas of the Ontario economy will be consulting with key sectors in all region of Ontario to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the provincial economy. MPPs across Ontario are expected to do the same. Continue Reading>> Local Coping with mental side of COVID Business What does Canada’s economy need after COVID?

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

Roller coaster real estate ride Local Home prices in Niagara have gone up. That may shock some people as the common sentiment is that the real estate sector, like practically every other one, has been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak. In some ways that holds true particularly this past April which saw a nose dive in sales and listings but prices have continued to creep up in Niagara. “There’s still a lot of multiple offers and homes selling for over the asking price,” said Lisa Botelho of RE/MAX Escarpment Reality. While real estate was deemed an essential service Botelho said her team was faced with a challenge right away. “We had a deal moving forward and the next day everything shut down. Thankfully everything still worked out.” She said it was common across the industry at the time the state of emergency was declared. “Many people had things in the works then everything came to a standstill,” explained Botelho.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Your donations help us continue to deliver the news and commentary you want to read.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Your donations help us continue to deliver the news and commentary you want to read.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Your donations help us continue to deliver the news and commentary you want to read.

Regional council split on mask issue Local The only thing that became clear after almost five hours of discussion at Wednesday’s special meeting of Regional Council, was that elected officials are deeply divided on the issue of implementing mandatory masks in Niagara to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin Vallier is the Editor In Chief for The Niagara Independent.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin Vallier is the Editor In Chief for The Niagara Independent.

Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone.

St. Catharines Council calls for “De-Funding” of local police Local Earlier this week St. Catharines City Council opted to call on the Niagara Region and the Police Services Board – the civilian body that oversees the Niagara Regional Police – to “re-assess ‘adequate policing” requirements. This motion was on the heels of a motion the city passed earlier this month calling for the decriminalization of personal possession of illicit drugs. The call specifically asks for the NRPS and Board to “re-assess ‘adequate policing’ requirements based on removing welfare checks, mental health, and suicide threat calls, as well as foot patrols that are only demanded because of perception.” It also asks the Niagara Region to re-allocate the savings to a civilian service such as the EMS, Niagara’s ambulatory service.

She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy.

Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained.

St. Catharines hospitality leaders hoping to bounce back Local The Nitsopoulos family has been in the hospitality business for decades. Owning the majority of St. Catharines’ hotels as well as a number of restaurants over the years, they’ve seen ups and downs in the business cycle but nothing could have prepared them for the crushing financial blow that COVID-19 has delivered the family business over the past six months. With Niagara recently entering Stage 3 business has started to slowly increase but it’s a far cry from what the properties would normally be doing this time of year. Add to the fact that $5 million was spent renovating the Parkway Social that’s attached to the Holiday Inn (part of the family’s Heart of Niagara Hotels company) and general manager Tom Nitsopoulos has had some stressful days and nights. “There was literally nothing you could do at one point,” he said. Nitsopoulos, who’s been general manager of the Ontario street property since 2005 while working alongside his father Angelo, said it was strange to see the facility so empty. “I was sad walking through the building. There would normally be 500 people with laughter and music,” he explained.

Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical.

Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process.

She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion.

I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred.

Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2.

I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred.

And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering.

Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained.

Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion. She issued a press release calling out the Premier, “We understand that this decision was undertaken at the provincial level without input from local health authorities, which the GNCC feels was a mistake. Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained.

Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing.

Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing.

Local public health authorities are the most familiar with the reality on the ground, and could explain whether a recent spike in cases, for example, is due to generalized community transmission which needs to be contained, or to an isolated group which has already been contained. Local health authorities must be a part of these decisions.” “Furthermore, we do not know the criteria for moving to Stage Two, and we feel that these criteria need to be publicly available. At the moment, we are trying to reach a goal without having been told what that goal is. This crisis calls for transparency in decision-making, and for everyone affected to have an understanding of the process, or at least to be able to access information about the process. The GNCC is calling on the Government of Ontario to make their re-opening decision-making and criteria open and transparent, and if it will not give control to local public health authorities, to at least allow them input in these decisions.” Kevin Vallier Kevin has spent over two decades as a public relations professional in a variety of sectors including professional sports, the arts, industry and healthcare.

Supplied photo. Both the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce and the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce (GNCC) are doing what they can to help local businesses try and survive the massive negative impact the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on Niagara’s small and medium sized businesses. “We’re making calls to all 2,000 of our members,” said Dolores Fabiano, executive director of the South Niagara Chambers. She said while there’s no doubt her members are feeling the tight squeeze of little to no revenue they are trying to stay positive. “If you’re a business owner you’re resilient.” Fabiano said it’s been interesting some of the things businesses around south Niagara are doing to not only help themselves but also support each other wherever possible. “We’re mobilizing our staff resources to call everyone. We’re connecting with the business owners because they’re the only ones left in the office.” Both Chambers said one of the biggest challenges, particularly for small business owners is filling out the necessary forms to claim some of the financial relief that has been made available by both levels of government. Fabiano said they’ve reached out to some of their volunteers who may have some fee time to give. “They can help business owners navigate the system and fill out the forms, walk them through the process.” Hugo Chesshire, policy and government relations manager for the GNCC agreed that making businesses aware of the programs and how to access them is critical. He said there are many businesses that now have no money coming in. “Smaller firms are saying they may not last 30 days.” Both Fabiano and Chesshire have spoken with MPP Sam Oosterhoff and Chesshire said he’s also spoken with St. Catharines MP Chris Bittle. Both Chamber executives said they are pleased with how provincial and federal politicians are going directly to businesses and Chambers asking what they need. Chesshire said in times like these, “government doesn’t know all the answers.” From a GNCC perspective, Chesshire said they are focusing on the tangible results. “How can we put money in hands of businesses?” He said in addition to passing on the concerns of business owners to government they have been putting out a list of businesses that deliver products or have takeout food as well as updating their website regularly as new announcement come out from both levels of government regarding business. “The funding from the federal government is pretty small compared to other countries. I think there will be more to come,” said Chesshire. While the local Chambers do their part to help their members survive these unprecedented times the only way to get back to normal as quick as possible is if everyone does their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19. “There’s a desperate need to take this more seriously than we are,” said Chesshire.

While 24 regions were on the list to reopen, 10 were denied. Among the 10 was Niagara. This announcement threw many in Niagara for a loop. The chart below demonstrates that Niagara has had a very low daily incidence of new COVID caseload. In fact in the last three weeks if the isolated Pioneer Flower Farms in St. Catharines outbreak of 23 on June 1 and 40 more from backdated tests on June 3rd are removed; the rest of Niagara has averaged only two new cases per day. The province’s own numbers show that Niagara has 151.5 COVID cases per 100,000 population. At the same time, three areas with substantially higher caseload incidences, Ottawa at 190, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark at 202.7 and Waterloo at 197.7, were all allowed to move to Stage 2. Knowledgeable of this, Niagara’s politicians and businesses, fully expected to get the greenlight from the Province, when they were denied, shock and anger set in. “Bitterly disappointing” is what Niagara Falls Tourism CEO Janice Thomson called it. “It’s a real shame not to be on that list.” Thomson said she crunched the numbers and Niagara only accounts for barely over two per cent of the province’s COVID-19 cases and so she can’t understand why Niagara didn’t get the green light to move into stage two. She said according to the businesses she represents, 95% are ready to open and 100% said they are willing to implement all guidelines and safety measures. “We’ve got thousands of workers ready to do what they do best which is hospitality,” she said. Thomson wasn’t the only one who represents business interests showing her frustration with Niagara not getting permission to further open its economy. Dolores Fabiano, Executive Director of the South Niagara Chambers of Commerce said, “It is disappointing that Niagara has been excluded from being allowed to go into stage 2. Our businesses have been working diligently to ensure a safe environment for employees and customers alike. We are eager to get back to business in Niagara just like the rest of the province.” Hugo Chesshire of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce said he too was hoping Niagara’s businesses would be given the all clear from the province “From a business perspective, it’s disappointing. Everyone is chomping at the bit.” Premier Ford has continuously said that these decisions were being made with the full input from not only Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, but with regular input from all of the Regional Medical Officers of Health. But Niagara’s Chief Medical Officer immediately put out notification that he had not been consulted by the province about the regional reopening nor of Niagara’s exclusion. Niagara’s acting Medical Officer of Health said that he essentially learned of the news the same time most of the province did. Dr. Hirji told The Niagara Independent, “Niagara Region Public Health was not consulted on the decisions by the province announced today around moving to Stage 2. We learnt of the regional approach to Stage 2 reopening only today (yesterday).” Yesterday during his press conference, Premier Ford was confronted about this lack of consultation and said he was unaware that it hadn’t occurred. Asked why Niagara wasn’t on the Stage 2 reopening list his response was that “Niagara Region cases ramped up 15%, which is staggering. I understand that a big chunk of that was migrant workers, but still when the numbers shoot up, you know, our medical team, we have no choice. And I asked specifically, was everyone contacted and the answer I got was yes, so I guess their Chief Medical Officer and ours are going back and forth. We’ll make sure without digging deep and pulling out papers and emails and everything else, we’re all in this together it’s not time to be finger pointing. We’re gonna make sure every community gets a follow up call.” Yesterday, Mishka Balsom of the GNCC weighed on the communication confusion.
