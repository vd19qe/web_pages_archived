Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Certain Businesses Allowed to Reopen Under Strict Safety Guidelines News Release Certain Businesses Allowed to Reopen Under Strict Safety Guidelines Steady Decrease in COVID-19 Cases Required Before Beginning Next Stage of Reopening May 1, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO ― The Ontario government is allowing certain businesses and workplaces to reopen as long as they comply with strict public health measures and operate safely during the COVID-19 outbreak. Those permitted to start up include seasonal businesses and some essential construction projects. Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has provided general recommendations on how the openings of businesses and workplaces could be implemented to support safe operations, including strict adherence to health and safety requirements. ""We are allowing certain businesses to reopen under strict guidelines because we are confident they can operate safely and adapt to the current environment,"" said Premier Ford. ""While further reductions in the spread are needed before we can begin reopening the province, we have the right framework and the right workplace guidelines in place to do so gradually and safely."" The government, in partnership with Ontario's health and safety associations, has developed more than 60 guidelines in response to COVID-19. These sector-specific measures will help employers prepare their workplaces so they can be reopened safely and ensure workers, customers and the general public are protected. By following the proper health and safety guidelines these businesses will be permitted to begin operations on Monday, May 4 at 12:01 a.m.: Garden centres and nurseries with curbside pick-up and delivery only; Lawn care and landscaping; Additional essential construction projects that include: shipping and logistics; broadband, telecommunications, and digital infrastructure; any other project that supports the improved delivery of goods and services; municipal projects; colleges and universities; child care centres; schools; and site preparation, excavation, and servicing for institutional, commercial, industrial and residential development; Automatic and self-serve car washes; Auto dealerships, open by appointment only; Golf courses may prepare their courses for the upcoming season, but not open to the public; and Marinas may also begin preparations for the recreational boating season by servicing boats and other watercraft and placing boats in the water, but not open to the public. Boats and watercraft must be secured to a dock in the marina until public access is allowed. ""Ontario workers and businesses have shown exemplary cooperation and resilience throughout the course of this crisis,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""We're beginning to ease restrictions on select businesses as we carefully and methodically re-open Ontario's economy and continue together on our path to renewed prosperity."" Although certain businesses are being permitted to reopen, it is critical that people continue to stay home, practise physical distancing and only go out for essential reasons, to pick up groceries, prescriptions or to keep a medical appointment. It is through these simple actions that Ontario is making progress to stop the spread of COVID-19. ""As we begin planning for the next phase of our fight against COVID-19, Ontarians should continue to stay home as much as possible to ensure we stop as quickly as possible the spread of this virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""While we have made tremendous progress in our shared battle against this new virus, we are not done yet. We need to keep up the fight by continuing to practise physical distancing and good hygiene habits."" On April 27, the government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which outlines the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts are using to advise the government on the loosening of emergency measures, as well as guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. While the government remains in Phase One of Ontario's Action Plan in response to COVID-19, Protect and Support, allowing certain businesses and workplaces to open under strict guidelines demonstrates the government's commitment to balance the needs of the economy with the health and safety of the people of Ontario. ""People's efforts are paying off and we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Our response has always been based on the current status of the outbreak in our province, and on what makes sense for Ontario. To be clear ― we haven't moved into the reopening phase of our response to COVID-19. Not yet. But based on the best public health advice available to us, we are a step closer.""

Office of the Premier TORONTO ― The Ontario government is ensuring employers have the safety guidelines they need to protect workers, customers, and the general public from COVID-19 as it prepares for a gradual reopening of the provincial economy. The government safety guidelines released today will provide direction to those working in manufacturing, food manufacturing and processing, restaurant and food service, and the agricultural sector. These measures build on more than 60 guidelines developed by Ontario's health and safety associations in response to COVID-19 for various sectors such as retail, health care, construction, transportation, police services, firefighters, and transit employees. ""We all want to reopen our businesses, services and favourite places across the province, but we must do it in a safe and responsible way,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why we are providing clear guidelines to employers, with practical measures to help them keep staff and customers safe while preventing the spread of COVID-19. By taking these steps, we will be prepared to get people back to work when the time is right."" These new sector-specific guidelines feature recommended actions employers can begin to plan for as they prepare to adapt to the new reality during COVID-19, including: Ways to ensure appropriate physical distancing, like eliminating pay-at-the-door options, holding team meetings outdoors, staggering shift times and using ground markings and barriers to manage traffic flow. Changes to the workplace, like installing plexiglass barriers, increasing the air intake on building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to increase air flow, and using boot sanitizing trays. Promoting proper workplace sanitation, providing personal protective equipment, substituting dry dusting with vacuuming, ensuring customer-facing staff are given hand sanitizer, providing a place to dispose of sanitizing wipes, and enforcing handwashing before and after breaks. The government is also issuing posters to promote a variety of useful safety tips. The posters offer helpful advice on physical distancing and sanitation. They are downloadable from the Ontario.ca website so employers can print and post them in their workplaces. ""We are truly in extraordinary times and employers and employees are facing situations they have never had to deal with before,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""It is incumbent on our government, with the advice of health officials, to provide the guidance and tips outlining the safest ways to reopen workplaces and help prevent the spread."" The government will work with Ontario's health and safety associations to bring forward additional workplace safety guidelines for more sectors in the coming days and weeks. Starting this week, 58 new inspectors will join the hundreds of existing provincial labour inspectors on the ground. The inspectors, which include workers from the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) and the Ontario College of Trades (OCOT), will be tasked with communicating COVID-19 safety guidelines to essential workplaces or enforcing emergency measures, including physical distancing and the closure of non-essential businesses. ""Protecting the health and well-being of Ontarians during the COVID-19 outbreak has been and will always be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These guidelines will help employers begin to plan for their safe reopening based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and in alignment with our framework to ease public health measures and restart our economy. In doing so, we can ensure we continue to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep workers safe."" ""Our province's businesses have made great efforts to protect the health and safety of their workers throughout the course of this pandemic,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""These new guidelines will help employers continue to protect their staff and customers as we begin to carefully and methodically re-open our economy, so that we can return Ontario to prosperity in the safest way possible."" The government is committed to a careful, stage-by-stage approach to loosening emergency measures and reopening Ontario's economy. Public health and workplace safety will remain the top priority, while balancing the needs of people and businesses.

Since emergency child care was introduced last month, almost 100 child care centres have reopened along with 40 Licensed Home Child Care Agencies in communities across the province. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While our frontline workers are looking after us, we need to make sure we're looking after them and their families,"" said Premier Ford. ""Providing emergency child care for our essential workers gives parents one less thing to worry about when they're on the job saving lives, protecting us, or keeping shelves stocked with food and necessities."" On March 22, 2020, the government announced an emergency order directing certain child care centres to reopen subject to physical distancing constraints as part of the province's support for health care and other frontline workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. The list of essential workers eligible to access emergency childcare has now been further expanded. To accommodate more children, 37 additional centres have been approved and will be reopening in the coming days. ""We are providing emergency child care to more frontline workers because in these unprecedented times, we will do whatever it takes to keep families safe and supported,"" said Minister Lecce. ""They are making tremendous sacrifices every day, and we will be there for them every step of the way."" The additional frontline workers who can now access emergency childcare services include: Workers in grocery stores and pharmacies Truck drivers (driver's licence Class A and Class D) Workers in the food supply chain, including food processing Workers in retirement homes Auxiliary workers in health care settings, including cooks and cleaning staff in hospitals and long-term care homes Interpreters and intervenors who support people who are deaf, deafened, hard of hearing and deafblind Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) emergency personnel Provincial officers and onsite staff in Ontario courts Canadian Armed Forces and Department of National Defence staff working in Ontario Additional workers supporting public safety and correctional services The Ontario Ministry of Education is working with Consolidated Municipal Service Managers (CMSM) and District Social Services Administration Boards (DSSAB) in their role as service system managers for early years and child care, as well as First Nations, to implement emergency child care centres in communities across the province. Ontario will continue to monitor local needs to ensure frontline staff can continue to work and will communicate more details as the situation evolves. A list of emergency child care centres is available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. Quick Facts The list of essential workers eligible to access emergency childcare was previously expanded on April 17, 2020 to include those who assist vulnerable communities, emergency response and law enforcement sector staff, more health and safety workers, and certain federal employees. Child care for members of the Canadian Armed Forces and employees of the Department of National Defence who are working in Ontario would be provided by a Military Family Resource Centre. The government has established strict guidelines for each centre and the local Medical Officer of Health must be consulted and supportive of protocols and actions in place. All sites are also required to have a protocol in place in the event that a child, parent or staff member at the site is exposed to COVID-19.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Announces Additional Workplaces that Can Reopen News Release Ontario Announces Additional Workplaces that Can Reopen Additional seasonal, retail and household businesses must follow public health guidelines May 14, 2020 1:30 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced the retailers, seasonal businesses and health and community service providers who will be permitted to open or expand their services on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., provided that the general trend on health indicators continues to improve as part of the first stage of the government's reopening framework. The workplaces opening as part this stage are well-positioned to put workplace safety measures in place and get more people back to work, while not overburdening public transit and other services. The government also announced additional seasonal services and activities will be permitted to open as early as Saturday May 16, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., in time for the Victoria Day long weekend, as key public health indicators continue to show progress. The details were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""During the last several weeks, the people of Ontario have been called on to make incredible sacrifices to help us stop the spread of COVID-19, including staying home from work, closing down businesses and going without a regular paycheque,"" said Premier Ford. ""However, we are reopening even more of our businesses beginning this long weekend. We are taking a cautious, balanced approach to our economic reopening, to protect the health and safety of everyone."" As soon as 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, May 16, 2020: Golf courses will be able to open, with clubhouses open only for washrooms and restaurants open only for take-out. Marinas, boat clubs and public boat launches may open for recreational use. Private parks and campgrounds may open to enable preparation for the season and to allow access for trailers and recreational vehicles whose owners have a full season contract. Businesses that board animals, such as stables, may allow boarders to visit, care for or ride their animal. The government's responsible and measured approach to reopening will allow business owners and service provider's time to ensure workplaces are safe for staff, consumers and the general public. Assuming trends in key public health indicators continue to improve, Ontario's first stage of reopening will begin on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. and will include: Retail services that are not in shopping malls and have separate street-front entrances with measures in place that can enable physical distancing, such as limiting the number of customers in the store at any one time and booking appointments beforehand or on the spot. Seasonal businesses and recreational activities for individual or single competitors, including training and sport competitions conducted by a recognized national or provincial sport organization. This includes indoor and outdoor non-team sport competitions that can be played while maintaining physical distancing and without spectators, such as tennis, track and field and horse racing. Animal services, specifically pet care services, such as grooming and training, and regular veterinary appointments. Indoor and outdoor household services that can follow public health guidelines, such as housekeepers, cooks, cleaning and maintenance. Lifting essential workplace limits on construction. Allowing certain health and medical services to resume, such as in-person counselling; in-person services, in addition to virtual services, delivered by health professionals; and scheduled surgeries, all based on the ability to meet pre-specified conditions as outlined in A Measured Approach to Planning for Surgeries and Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic. ""We are taking a cautious, practical and reasonable approach to restarting the economy, while maintaining the health and safety of the people of Ontario as our top priority,"" said Minister Phillips. ""This will allow Ontario to emerge from this outbreak with a clear path to economic recovery that keeps people safe and healthy."" The government and health and safety associations have released more than 90 safety guidance documents to assist employers in multiple sectors, including construction, retail, facilities maintenance and manufacturing. As new sectors of the economy begin to reopen, additional resources will be made available to help protect the safety of workers and the general public. To support business-owners, workers and the economic recovery of the province, the government has launched a website to provide businesses with information on personal protective equipment (PPE) suppliers. The Workplace PPE Supplier Directory has an up-to-date list of Ontario companies and business associations that are ready to supply personal protective equipment. ""Ontario's businesses stepped up at the outset of this crisis not only to keep their workers and customers safe, but to come forward with innovative ideas and solutions that represent the best of the Ontario Spirit,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""This new website is truly a made-in-Ontario approach with Ontario businesses helping Ontario businesses."" The government continues to prioritize the needs of patients, frontline health care workers and first responders when it comes to having critical equipment and supplies to protect themselves during the COVID-19 outbreak. Businesses are encouraged to access only the PPE they need to keep their employees and customers safe. ""We will leave no stone unturned in our mission to keep workers in this province safe,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Ontario's labour laws are clear: businesses must protect the health and safety of workers, including against workplace hazards like COVID-19. That's why our ministry has released practical safety guidelines, doubled our capacity to help people by phone and hired more inspectors. We want to ensure everyone is safe at work."" To ensure that these first actions to reopen the province are a success, the public should continue to adhere to public health measures, including practising physical distancing or wearing a face covering when physical distancing is difficult or not possible, as well as regular handwashing and staying home when ill. The Chief Medical Officer of Health will closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when certain public health restrictions, including adjustments to social gatherings can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened. ""Because of the collective efforts of all Ontarians, we are making real and significant progress in our battle against COVID-19, with the number of new cases each day shrinking,"" said Minister Elliott. ""As we move forward with caution, public health experts will closely monitor each stage of reopening to carefully assess the evolution of the outbreak, so we can benefit from the best practices and lessons learned across Ontario."" Quick Facts The province will be providing an update on school closures and child care early next week. If you have questions about what will be open or impacts to your business or employment, call the Stop the Spread Business Information Line at 1-888-444-3659. On April 30, 2020, the government, in partnership with Ontario’s Health and Safety Associations, released sector-specific guidelines and posters to help protect workers, customers and the general public in preparation for the gradual reopening of the economy. These contain recommendations and tips for employers on how to keep workers and customers safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19. On April 27, 2020, the government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which unveiled the guiding principles to the safe, stage-by-stage reopening of businesses, services and public spaces in Ontario. This gradual reopening is part of the first stage of Phase 2: Restart in Ontario’s Framework for Reopening our Province. On March 25, 2020, the government launched Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19, a $17-billion package with funding targeted to protect the people of Ontario and support jobs, businesses and families as part of the government’s initial response to the pandemic. The new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee wants to hear directly from people and organizations from all regions and sectors to help inform the next phases of Ontario’s Action Plan in response to COVID-19. The survey, which is seeking feedback on the impacts of COVID-19 on personal finances, business supports and government relief measures, will be open until June 2020.

Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is extending the Declaration of Emergency under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. This additional time will ensure the province has the necessary tools and health care capacity to contain COVID-19, while gradually reopening businesses, services, and amenities safely. Passed during a special sitting of the Ontario Legislature today, the Declaration of Emergency has been extended until June 2. The declaration will allow Ontario to continue to enforce current emergency orders, such as restricting retirement and long-term care home employees from working in more than one facility and prohibiting events and gatherings of more than five people. Since the emergency was first declared on March 17, the government has taken over 150 actions to help protect individuals, families, and businesses from the impacts of COVID-19. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website, under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. ""We are making steady progress to flatten the curve and get more people back to work safely, including our legislators, but we still have far to go in defeating COVID-19,"" said Premier Ford. ""Extending the declaration of emergency will allow us to continue to take action to protect Ontarians, while carefully and cautiously reopening more parts of our economy."" The House also passed the COVID-19 Response and Reforms to Modernize Ontario Act, 2020, which will help people conduct business while practising physical distancing by: Providing authority to address in-person attendance rules for school board trustees' meetings in regulation. This would provide the flexibility in certain emergency situations to allow trustees to meet virtually during school closures; Enabling corporations to call and hold meetings virtually, as applicable, and extending the time period in which annual meetings must be held in specific circumstances; Allowing designations of a beneficiary to be provided electronically for Retirement Savings Plans, Retirement Income Funds, Locked-in Retirement Accounts, Life Income Funds and Tax-Free Savings Accounts; Allowing electronic filing of business registration documents, and the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to accept copies of business registration documents and e-signatures; Allowing for regulations to set out the parameters for remotely commissioning or notarizing a document; Extending, on a one-time basis for 2020, the legislated four-year period during which a Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO) election is mandated to be held to give more time to support remote voting. The Expenditure Estimates for the 2020-21 fiscal year were also tabled in the Legislature. This includes program spending to support the $17 billion announced as part of Ontario's Action Plan 2020: Responding to COVID-19 to ensure the province's health care system, communities, and economy are better positioned to weather challenges posed by the pandemic. ""Today's legislation is just one step further in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Government House Leader Paul Calandra.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Leading COVID-19 Research in Canada News Release Ontario Leading COVID-19 Research in Canada Province Announces First Phase of Research Projects to Fight COVID-19 May 21, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is quickly moving forward with innovative research to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19. These projects, part of the government's $20 million Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund, focus on areas of research such as vaccine development, diagnostics, drug trials and development, and social sciences. Additionally, Ontario is leading the country with 22 clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""Ontario is leading the nation in the battle to defeat this deadly virus. We have some of the most incredible researchers and innovators anywhere in the world right here in our province,"" said Premier Ford. ""There's no reason why a new rapid testing method, vaccine or treatment can't be found right here in Ontario. Our government is investing in some very promising research proposals, which have the potential to save lives and help us get back to a way of life that is as close to normal as possible."" The Ontario government is funding 15 high-quality and promising proposals that were submitted in response to a recent call for proposals for the Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund. Announced only four weeks ago, the $20 million fund was created as an immediate response to engaging the research community on ways to fight COVID-19. Where relevant, a portion of these funds will be used to cover costs associated with licensing and commercialization, including patenting, of the valuable intellectual property generated by successful projects to ensure any economic outcomes from these proposals benefit Ontario's economy, workers and researchers. ""Researchers in Ontario represent some of the best and brightest in the country and we are tapping into their expertise to find Ontario-based solutions to treat the infection and stop the spread of the virus,"" said Minister Romano. ""Our government is encouraged by the ideas and solutions researchers have put forward to-date. These projects will support Ontario's response to the COVID-19 outbreak and help us make smart and effective decisions as we look ahead to the future."" Many of Ontario's research hospitals, universities, colleges and research institutes are leading Canada with their ground-breaking COVID-19 research projects. Eleven of the 22 clinical trials that are being led by these institutions have already secured the necessary approvals by Health Canada to advance potential vaccines and therapeutics. Ontario also has the largest share of the total 25 clinical trials approved by Health Canada in the country. ""Research will not only play an important role in the fight against COVID-19, but it will also drive innovation and our economic recovery as we restart the province,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This $20 million investment in our research sector will mean more made-in-Ontario solutions as we continue to fight this virus and move into the next phase of our recovery."" Ontario's research will expand the global understanding of COVID-19 and further the capacity in the health care, artificial intelligence, and supply chain sectors to assist frontline workers today and in the future. ""Research to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19 is a key component in our fight against the virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""These projects and clinical trials will contribute to both our local and global efforts to understand how COVID-19 is evolving and inform health system planning and the careful and gradual reopening of the provincial economy."" Quick Facts These 15 proposals are the first to receive funding from the Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund, with additional projects expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Projects were evaluated by a peer review committee. The selection process for these types of projects typically takes up to eighteen weeks to complete. For these projects the selection process was shortened to two weeks while maintaining the same high-quality and independent process that leveraged the expertise of researchers to evaluate. The government of Ontario is investing $20 million to support COVID-19 research by tapping into the expertise of Ontario’s colleges and universities, research institutions and non-profit scientific partners. Funding was announced as part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. The Ontario government received a positive response from the research sector to the request for proposals for the Fund, with hundreds of eligible submissions. To date, the Ontario Together portal has received donations of more than five million pieces of personal protective equipment and other supplies to protect frontline workers. Over 54,000 users have visited the SPARK Ontario website to learn how they can volunteer, and over 3,500 civic-minded Ontarians from across the province have signed up on the site to volunteer. Ontario is investing in artificial intelligence (AI) research through CIFAR to stop the spread of COVID-19. Throughout 2020, projects will identify early intervention strategies and effective treatments, support public health measures, and help improve our understanding of viral transmission and the mental health and social impacts of the virus.

Ministry of Government and Consumer Services TORONTO -The Government of Ontario is making it easier for people to conduct business and practice physical distancing in the new COVID-19 environment. The province is permitting Ontario corporations to conduct virtual meetings and to defer certain annual meetings in specified circumstances and is allowing the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to accept copies of documents, electronic signatures on documents, and electronic filing of documents. These changes are part of COVID-19 Response and Reforms to Modernize Ontario Act, 2020. ""The COVID-19 outbreak has forced change upon everyone in order to adhere to public health measures and to flatten the curve,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""The reality is, we must balance the need to practice physical distancing with the need to conduct business each and every day. These legislative changes will provide corporations with an opportunity to rethink how they operate in the new normal and be more efficient in the future."" Providing temporary flexibility to hold meetings virtually, defer annual meetings in specified circumstances, and submit e-filings will help Ontario corporations to safely meet their obligations during the COVID-19 outbreak while reducing the number of touchpoints needed to file documentation. Additionally, the COVID-19 Response and Reforms to Modernize Ontario Act, 2020 will permanently allow the Ministry to accept copies of documents signed by electronic signature, providing greater flexibility to businesses moving forward. The government has consulted with the Business Law Modernization and Burden Reduction Council on these legislative amendments to address corporate and business law issues during the pandemic. The Council is a group of legal experts appointed by the Minister of Government and Consumer Services to advise on modernizing Ontario's business laws, some of which have not changed in over ten years. The government also consulted with key businesses, condominium corporation sector stakeholders, and co-operative corporation sector stakeholders. ""I want to thank all of the stakeholders and advisors who have taken the time to provide feedback and actionable solutions during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Minister Thompson. ""By working together, we are able to navigate our way through what are clearly unchartered waters."" Quick Facts Legislative amendments to the Corporations Act, the Business Corporations Act, the Co-operative Corporations Act and the Condominium Act, 1998 related to virtual meetings and the deferral of annual meetings in some circumstances, are in force and retroactive to March 17, 2020, the day the Declaration of Emergency came into effect. To enable businesses to file copies of documents, documents signed by electronic signature and temporary electronic filing to the Ministry, the Alternative Filing Methods for Business Act was introduced along with legislative amendments to the Business Corporations Act, Business Names Act, Corporations Act, Corporations Information Act, Co-operative Corporations Act, Extra-Provincial Corporations Act, Limited Partnerships Act, and the unproclaimed Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, 2010 (to take effect upon proclamation). The Business Law Modernization and Burden Reduction Council is a short-term advisory body comprising eight members that have provided recommendations to the government on business law matters since February 2019.

Office of the Premier TORONTO — As the economy gradually reopens, the Ontario government is helping people affected by COVID-19 get back to work. The province is investing in Ontario's first Virtual Action Centre, an online counselling and training portal, to support laid off and unemployed hospitality workers, and is helping apprentices by providing grants to purchase tools, protective equipment and clothing for their trade, along with forgiving previous loans to purchase tools. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""The impact of COVID-19 has been devastating for many business owners, workers, and families, and that's why we are doing everything we can to help people through this difficult period,"" said Premier Ford. ""Hospitality workers and our skilled tradespeople have been among those hardest hit by this pandemic. These new programs will ensure they're ready to get back on the job and play an important role in our economic recovery."" The government is providing an Ontario Tools Grant of $2.5 million in 2020-21 and $7.5 million in 2021-22 and ongoing. This will help new eligible apprentices purchase the equipment they need to start their careers. The funding amounts will be distributed as follows: $1,000 for those in motive power sector trades; $600 for those in construction and industrial sector trades; $400 for those in service sector trades. To be eligible for the new grant, apprentices must have: completed level 1 training on or after April 1, 2020; an active registered training agreement; and been registered as an apprentice for at least 12 months. The government is also forgiving more than $10 million in outstanding loans owed by apprentices for tool purchases made at the beginning of their careers. The Loans for Tools Program allowed thousands of new apprentices to buy tools, equipment, clothing, manuals and code books required for their trade. About 19,000 apprentices who participated in the program owed, on average, $495. ""If we are going to rebuild our economy, we must reach out and help the workers and businesses that are suffering as a result of COVID-19,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""The programs that we are announcing today will leave more money in the pockets of our apprentices and support those hospitality workers who have been laid-off by providing access to the training and services they need to recover and rejoin the workforce."" The government is also investing nearly $2 million to open a Virtual Action Centre in partnership with UNITE HERE Local 75. This virtual job training resource will provide up to 7,000 unemployed workers in the hospitality sector with access to a wide range of services and supports online and over the phone, including: Stress management and mental health resources through video conferencing; Immediate health and safety online training for workers who return to work at designated quarantined sites; Technical skills online training; Online training to upgrade English language and digital skills; Peer group facilitation and employment preparation through videoconferencing. UNITE HERE will operate the Virtual Action Centre. UNITE HERE is a union that represents workers in hotels, restaurants, racetracks and casinos, laundry and food service companies, airport concessions and apparel, textile and general manufacturing and distribution centers. ""Ontario's hotel and hospitality sectors create thousands of jobs across the province,"" said Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries. ""This new virtual platform will make sure that those workers are supported as we gradually reopen the province and prepare our $35 billion tourism sector to welcome visitors back."" ""We are very grateful for the generous support of the Ontario government,"" said Guled Warsame, President of UNITE HERE Local 75. ""This support will provide services and skills training to our members who are laid-off due to COVID-19. We know that people are at the heart of the hospitality industry.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom As Ontario Reopens, People Urged to Continue Following Public Health Advice News Release As Ontario Reopens, People Urged to Continue Following Public Health Advice Face coverings now recommended when physical distancing is a challenge May 20, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — As the Ontario government carefully and gradually reopens the province, those taking public transit, returning to work or going out shopping are being urged to continue to adhere to public health advice as the best line of defence against COVID-19. To assist the public, the Ministry of Health today released specific recommendations on how to choose, wear and care for appropriate face coverings used in public where physical distancing is not possible, along with additional safety measures for provincial transit agencies. The details were released today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Now that we are in Stage 1 of our Framework for Reopening the Province, more people will be returning to workplaces, going to stores and parks, and using public transit,"" said Premier Ford. ""I strongly urge everyone to continue following the public health advice, such as physical distancing and restricting gatherings to five people or less. Although we are making progress, COVID-19 is still a risk that we must guard against. Please stay safe and protect yourself and others."" Since the beginning of the outbreak, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has advised people to wash their hands often, stay at home if feeling ill, and practise physical distancing by staying at least two metres apart from anyone outside their household. Now that the province is reopening, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health experts are recommending that individuals wear a face covering where physical distancing is not possible, such as on public transit or in a small grocery store or pharmacy. In order to assist people and reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, the Ministry of Health released the following face covering recommendations: Wear your face covering safely and snugly to cover your nose and mouth, without any gaps. Ensure your face covering is made of at least two layers of tightly woven material and can be cleaned multiple times without losing its shape; Medical masks, such as surgical and N95 masks, should be reserved for use by health care workers, those providing direct care, first responders and individuals who are ill and must leave their home for essential reasons such as seeking medical care, picking up medication or groceries; Face coverings should not be placed on or used by children under the age of two; anyone who has trouble breathing; and anyone who is unable to remove it without assistance. ""If you need a face covering, it is critically important people wear one that is appropriate for the situation,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Those taking transit or going out who can't physically distance should wear non-medical grade cloth masks. We need to reserve all of the medical masks to protect our frontline health care workers, first responders and people who are ill."" Workers and employers may also consider using face coverings as an additional public health measure in addition to mandatory occupational health and safety measures. To assist provincial transit agencies in protecting transit staff and riders in this new environment, the Ministry of Health is also recommending the following measures be put in place: Physical distancing of at least two metres by admitting fewer passengers and using physical markers between seats; The use of face coverings, particularly when physical distancing is not feasible; Ensuring the availability of alcohol-based hand rub upon entering and exiting the vehicle; Implementing engineering controls like plexiglass windows between drivers and passengers; and Enhanced cleaning, particularly of high-touch surfaces. ""Ontario's public transit systems are critical to supporting the economy and getting people where they need to go as the province begins to reopen,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""The health and well-being of all transit workers and passengers is a top priority for our government and we will be working with transit agencies to ensure that public transit can continue to operate safely."" All Canadians continue to be legally required to self-isolate for 14 days when returning home from international travel. In the meantime, Ontario and public health experts will carefully monitor the key public health indicators outlined in A Framework to Reopening our Province at each stage of reopening and will adjust public health measures if necessary.

""The people of Ontario have been doing a fantastic job to help flatten the curve and stop the spread of this terrible virus. With warmer weather beginning, individuals and families will now be able to enjoy many outdoor amenities, but everyone must continue to maintain physical distancing from those outside of their household."" To ensure that individuals and families have safe access to outdoor spaces, it is critical they take everyday steps to reduce exposure to the virus, such as maintaining physical distancing by staying two metres apart from anyone outside of their household, washing hands regularly, and staying home if feeling unwell. ""It's never been more important for people to continue following the public health measures and advice we've laid out, so we don't undo the tremendous progress we've made to contain COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While reopening parks and other outdoor spaces is important for our physical and mental health, we're encouraging people to be responsible by keeping a safe distance of at least two metres from members outside of their household.""

The conditions include keeping vehicles two metres or more apart, only members of the same household can be in one vehicle, people will not be able to leave their vehicles, and no more than five people can conduct the service at one time from outside a motor vehicle and they must stay at least two metres apart.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Health and Safety Top Priority as Schools Remain Closed News Release Health and Safety Top Priority as Schools Remain Closed Government unveils plans for reopening child care, day camps and initiatives to strengthen learning into the summer May 19, 2020 1:15 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is protecting the health and safety of students during the COVID-19 outbreak by keeping schools closed for the rest of this school year. This decision was made after consulting with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, health experts on the COVID-19 Command Table, and medical experts at The Hospital for Sick Children. At the same time, the government is planning for the reopening of schools for the 2020-21 school year, the gradual reopening of child care, and the opening of summer day camps subject to the continuing progress in trends of key public health indicators. Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Nothing is more important than protecting our kids in this province, bar none over anything,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today's announcement gives parents certainty, knowing that their children can continue to learn safely at home and that we have a plan for child care as we work to gradually reopen more of our economy, when it is safe to do so."" All students who were on track to graduate from secondary school before the initial school closure order was made in March will be able to graduate, and all students will receive report cards. Later this summer, the government will announce a plan to strengthen learning and safety protocols to enable students and staff to return to in-class instruction for the 2020-21 school year. That plan will be bolstered by an enhanced province-wide virtual learning program that will allow all students to learn, regardless of the challenges that may transpire in the coming months. Private schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will also remain closed for the safety and protection of children, families and staff through Stage 1 of the Framework for Reopening the Province. Emergency child care will continue to operate and provide support for health care and other frontline workers. A gradual reopening of child care is expected to begin when the province is ready to transition to Stage 2 based on public health criteria, which will include robust safety protocols for the safety of Ontario's youngest learners and their staff. ""We will never waver from our commitment to keep your child safe, while learning at home,"" said Minister Lecce. ""Our plan will ensure students receive the best educational experience, both inside and outside the classroom, during this difficult time. That is why we are strengthening summer learning opportunities, reopening summer day camps, and it is why we will continue to make the case for synchronous, live, and dynamic learning."" Assuming trends in key public health indicators continue to improve, summer day camps, both indoor and outdoor, may be permitted in July and August of this year with strict health and safety guidelines to be developed in partnership with local public health, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and municipalities. Overnight camps will not be permitted to operate in the summer of 2020. The province also unveiled an expanded seven-point summer learning plan to ensure Ontario students have every opportunity to continue their learning through the summer months. Summer learning programs are being expanded to reach the most students in Ontario history, to ensure they remain on track to start the 2020-21 school year with the confidence and knowledge required to succeed. To support at-home learning, the government is leveraging all tools, resources, technologies and services to assist school boards deliver equitable and effective learning through access to technology and Internet connectivity, especially for students in rural and remote parts of Ontario. To help improve access to remote learning, Ontario is partnering with 34 organizations and private businesses, along with school boards, to address key needs among educators, students and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ontario has worked to identify and make available low-cost, high-impact solutions that can significantly improve the Learn at Home experience now and into the future. Access to digital learning resources, supports for special education needs and mental health, as well as Internet connectivity and access to devices have all been identified by school boards and other stakeholders as urgent needs during the current school closure period. These organizations and businesses were identified through a call for proposals on the Ontario Together website between March 31, 2020 and April 21, 2020. Quick Facts The Ontario government is transforming elementary and secondary education to create more fluency with digital learning and literacy, provide equitable access provincewide to high quality online courses, and improve teacher capacity to support remote learning. On March 20, 2020, the Ministry of Education unveiled the Learn at Home / Apprendre à la maison portal, which includes resources for families and students while schools remain closed. The portal has received 3.35 million views to date. Nearly 25,000 teachers have taken the Ministry of Education professional development program on virtual and synchronous learning. On May 9, 2020, the government introduced a plan to support child care operators during the emergency period so that spaces remain protected for parents as they return to the labour market. Ontario is helping parents pay for the extra costs associated with school and child care closures during the COVID-19 outbreak through the Support for Families initiative, a one-time payment of $200 per child up to 12 years of age, and $250 for those with special needs, including children enrolled in private schools. To date, the province has supported approximately 1.23 million children and youth in Ontario.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Opens Up COVID-19 Testing Across the Province News Release Ontario Opens Up COVID-19 Testing Across the Province Strategy Expands Testing for General Public, Frontline Workers, First Responders and Workplaces May 29, 2020 1:15 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — As the province carefully and gradually reopens the economy, the Ontario government is implementing the next phase of its COVID-19 testing strategy to detect and quickly stop the spread of the virus. Testing will now be available to more people in more locations across the province. Today, Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, released the next phase of the province's COVID-19 testing plan, Protecting Ontarians Through Enhanced Testing, which includes three branches of testing: Assessment Centre Testing: expanding who gets tested to now include asymptomatic individuals concerned about exposure and continued routine symptomatic testing at assessment centres. Targeted Campaigns: detecting and containing cases by expanding asymptomatic surveillance for vulnerable populations, including in long-term care homes and other shared living spaces like shelters and group homes, as well as targeted testing of workplaces in priority sectors which work with priority populations and where it may be difficult to physically distance. Outbreak Management: testing to ensure rapid and agile response capacity for outbreak management, including in specific neighbourhoods and regions or at hospitals, institutions and workplaces. ""Ontario now has the most open and robust testing criteria in the entire country. In fact, anyone who feels they need a test will be able to get a test,"" said Premier Ford. ""We can't manage what we can't measure, and our newly expanded testing strategy is our best defence against stopping the spread of COVID-19 as we gradually and safely reopen the province. More proactive testing will give employers and their employees confidence as they return to work and will fortify our alert system for any potential surge in new cases."" Together, these branches of testing will support Ontario regions' extensive efforts to reduce the rate of transmission, also known as instantaneous reproduction number, or Rt. To help enable increased access to routine symptomatic testing, people will no longer need a referral to go to any of the more than 130 assessment centres across Ontario. Information about the assessment centres is now easily accessible on Ontario's dedicated COVID-19 website. ""The significant expansion of testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals will go hand in hand with public health units' ongoing contact tracing and case management efforts to stop the spread of the virus and keep our families and our communities safe,"" said Minister Elliott. ""I just want to caution people, although your test may be negative, you must continue to practise physical distancing, wear a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge, and wash your hands regularly. These simple actions will help keep everyone safe and healthy."" Ontario will also expand proactive surveillance testing to detect outbreaks and more actively monitor any spread among our most vulnerable populations in hospitals, long-term care homes, group homes, shelters, emergency child care centres, correctional facilities and other shared living spaces. This will include testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic residents and frontline staff in long-term care and retirement homes, as well as those working with priority populations, including first responders, essential workers and other workplaces as the economy gradually reopens. Moving forward, the province expects that private-sector workplace testing will leverage private and public resources as the government works with private-sector employers to develop the appropriate models for each sector and workplace. Further proactive surveillance testing will also be conducted in rural, remote and Indigenous communities. In response to a declaration of an outbreak in a specific neighbourhood, region, institution or workplace, the province is also developing agile testing resources, such as mobile testing teams, that can be rapidly deployed to communities across Ontario to enhance existing outbreak management. Ontario will also soon release a renewed strategy to support public health units with case management and contact tracing, including launching a new exposure notification app that will alert Ontarians when they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and would recommend appropriate actions, such as monitoring for symptoms, self-isolation and/or appropriate next steps on getting tested. Quick Facts On May 14, 2020, the province expanded its testing guidance to include a broader range of symptoms for all populations and to help guide decision-making on testing of priority population groups. To get tested, people should visit Ontario's website to find their local assessment centre and whether they need to call ahead to make an appointment. No Ontarian will be declined a test at an assessment centre (either through appointment or walk-in, per the processes of each individual assessment centre), especially those who are symptomatic or who are concerned they have been exposed to COVID-19. Ontario continues to lead large Canadian provinces in daily testing volumes, and to date, has completed 680,687 tests, with 69,318 tests completed since May 24, 2020. Ontario has a provincewide network of more than 20 laboratory sites working in coordination to further increase capacity and test turn-around times for COVID-19 testing.

Office of the Premier TORONTO ― In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Ontario is extending the provincial Declaration of Emergency to June 30. The decision supports the government's efforts to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and protect the health and safety of Ontarians as the province reopens in a measured and responsible way. The extension, under s.7.0.7 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, was approved by the Ontario legislature earlier today. ""Extending the provincial Declaration of Emergency will allow us to safely and gradually reopen the province, while we continue to use every resource at our disposal to battle this deadly virus,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are not out of the woods yet, so it is critical that we exercise caution to keep everyone safe, including protecting our most vulnerable citizens in long-term care homes, retirement homes and group homes."" As Ontario charts a path to recovery, the Declaration will support the continued enforcement of emergency orders that give hospitals and long-term care homes the necessary flexibility to respond to COVID-19 and protect vulnerable populations and the public as the province reopens. Current emergency orders include allowing frontline care providers to redeploy staff where they are needed most, enabling public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support case management and contact tracing, limiting long-term care and retirement home staff to working at one home, and preventing unfair pricing of necessary goods. The Declaration of Emergency may be further extended with the approval of the legislature, as set out in the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Extending Infectious Disease Emergency Leave for Workers during COVID-19 News Release Ontario Extending Infectious Disease Emergency Leave for Workers during COVID-19 New Regulation will protect employees from permanent layoffs and businesses from potential closures June 1, 2020 8:52 A.M. Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development TORONTO - The Ontario government is taking steps to help ensure that as the economy gradually and safely reopens workers will have jobs to return to and businesses will be protected from incurring unsustainable termination costs. Today, the government announced that it has enacted a new regulatory amendment that will put non-unionized employees on Infectious Disease Emergency Leave during the COVID-19 outbreak any time their hours of work are temporarily reduced by their employer due to COVID-19. This will ensure businesses aren't forced to terminate employees after their ESA temporary layoff periods have expired. Terminations triggered when temporary layoffs exceed the permitted length under the Employment Standards Act can result in costly payouts which, for many businesses, could be the difference between survival and closure. Under the new regulatory change to the Employment Standards Act, non-unionized employees who have had their hours reduced or eliminated because of the pandemic will be deemed to be on Infectious Disease Emergency Leave. Workers will remain employed with legal protections and be eligible for federal emergency income support programs. ""As we take the necessary steps to safely and gradually restart the economy, we need to make sure business owners can reopen their doors and workers have jobs to go back to,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training & Skills Development. ""This regulatory change will protect businesses from being forced to permanently lay off their employees due to COVID-19 and suffer a financial loss that could shutter their operations for good."" Many businesses had to close or reduce operations to comply with emergency orders necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19. According to Statistics Canada, 379,000 Ontario workers were temporarily laid off in April 2020, an increase of 2,496 per cent compared with one year earlier. The regulatory amendment applies retroactively to March 1, 2020 and will expire six weeks after the declared emergency ends. The regulatory amendments do not include employees represented by a trade union. The government is also supporting people and businesses by providing billions of dollars in deferrals and relief. That includes deferring $1.9 billion in Workplace Safety and Insurance Board premium payments until August 31, 2020, $10 billion in interest and penalty relief, and other deferrals to improve cash flow, protect jobs and help household budgets. In addition, the province is partnering with the federal government to provide commercial rent relief for commercial tenants and landlords through the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program. Quick Facts The Financial Accountability Office of Ontario estimates that about 2.2 million Ontario employees were directly affected by pandemic-related shutdowns, through either job losses (1.1 million), temporary layoffs or sharply reduced hours (1.1 million) in 2020. Termination and severance obligations create a significant financial burden for businesses. For example, a restaurant with 30 staff could be liable for termination payments as high as $100,000.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Supports Those Struggling with Electricity Bills during COVID-19 News Release Ontario Supports Those Struggling with Electricity Bills during COVID-19 New Initiatives Help Keep Rates Stable and Affordable, while Offering Greater Choice June 1, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government announced that it will continue to support provincial electricity consumers by providing stability and greater customer choice, while helping those struggling to pay their energy bills as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Details of the new programs were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, and Bill Walker, Associate Minister of Energy. Initiatives include: $9 million for the COVID-19 Energy Assistance Program (CEAP) to support consumers struggling to pay their energy bills during the pandemic. CEAP will provide one-time payments to consumers to help pay down any electricity bill debt incurred over the COVID‑19 period. Applications will be available through local utilities in the upcoming months; $8 million for the COVID-19 Energy Assistance Program for Small Business (CEAP-SB) to provide support to businesses struggling with bill payments as a result of the outbreak; and An extension of the Ontario Energy Board's winter disconnection ban until July 31, 2020 to ensure no one is disconnected from their natural gas or electricity service during these uncertain times. In addition, the government recently announced that it will continue the suspension of time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates and, starting on June 1, 2020, customers will be billed based on a new fixed COVID-19 Recovery Rate of 12.8 cents per kilowatt hour. ""While we make progress to contain this deadly virus, we know people will need to stay home when possible and businesses will need ongoing support as we gradually and safely reopen the economy,"" said Premier Ford. ""Providing additional rate relief, flexibility and customer choice will help ensure everyone can recover from this extraordinary crisis and get back to a life that is as normal as possible."" Starting June 1, 2020, the new COVID-19 Recovery Rate comes into effect for electricity customers who pay TOU rates. This fixed rate will apply to TOU customer bills 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing stability and certainty for consumers as the government restarts the economy and supports individuals and families who continue to spend more time at home. The COVID-19 Recovery Rate will be in place until October 31, 2020, followed by a new customer choice initiative. Starting November 1, 2020, customers will be able to choose a plan that best suits their household and lifestyle with the option of either TOU electricity rates or tiered pricing, which will provide a set rate for electricity up to a certain level of consumption. ""We recognize that businesses and families are living with a great deal of uncertainty, and they need to know what they can expect when they open their electricity bills every month,"" said Minister Rickford. ""The new COVID-19 Recovery Rate will provide stability for Ontario electricity consumers, while we work to re-open our province and restart our economy."" The government will continue to subsidize electricity bills by 31.8 per cent through the Ontario Electricity Rebate. The government is providing approximately $5.6 billion in 2020-21 as part of its existing electricity cost relief programs, to help ensure more affordable electricity bills for eligible residential, farm and small business consumers. ""With the financial hardships faced by so many in our province as a result of COVID-19, those struggling to pay their electricity bills need support,"" said Minister Walker. ""This program, in partnership with the Ontario Energy Board and local distribution companies, will support electricity consumers by keeping rates stable and affordable."" Quick Facts The new COVID-19 Recovery Rate is the Ontario Energy Board (OEB)’s Average Regulated Price Plan (RPP) Rate, which is based on the forecast average electricity supply cost for RPP consumers as of November 1, 2019, as published in the OEB’s most recent RPP Price Report. Time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates vary by time of day and are comprised of three different rate periods of off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak pricing. Tiered electricity rates provide customers with a set rate for electricity up to a certain level of consumption. The rate increases for all electricity use that exceeds this threshold. The OEB sets both tiered and TOU rates as part of the RPP. There are approximately five million residential consumers, farms and some small businesses billed using TOU electricity prices under the RPP.

""We are able to make this announcement today because of the extraordinary effort of our frontline workers and every other person in the province who helped to stop the spread of this deadly virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""Entering Stage 2 means parts of the province will see more people back on the job and an opportunity to get back together with friends and family. Although this is extremely encouraging, I urge everyone to exercise caution and continue to follow public health advice as we are not out of the woods yet."" Businesses and services permitted to reopen with proper health and safety measures in place in regions entering Stage 2 include: Outdoor dine-in services at restaurants, bars and other establishments, including patios, curbside, parking lots and adjacent properties; Select personal and personal care services with the proper health and safety measures in place, including tattoo parlours, barber shops, hair salons and beauty salons; Shopping malls under existing restrictions, including food services reopening for take-out and outdoor dining only; Tour and guide services, such as bike and walking, bus and boat tours, as well as tasting and tours for wineries, breweries and distilleries; Water recreational facilities such as outdoor splash pads and wading pools, and all swimming pools; Beach access and additional camping at Ontario Parks; Camping at private campgrounds; Outdoor-only recreational facilities and training for outdoor team sports, with limits to enable physical distancing; Drive-in and drive-through venues for theatres, concerts, animal attractions and cultural appreciation, such as art installations; Film and television production activities, with limits to enable physical distancing; and Weddings and funerals, with limits on social gatherings to 10 people.

""The people and employers of Ontario have demonstrated responsible behaviour throughout the global pandemic. I'm confident that will continue in Stage 2 and beyond. Our collective health and the economic recovery of the province depend on it."" At the beginning of each week, the government will provide an update on the ongoing assessment of these regions, and whether they are ready to move into Stage 2 at the end of the week. Everyone, regardless of where they live in the province, must continue to follow public health advice, including to practise physical distancing, wear a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, wash hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened. ""As a result of efforts of all Ontarians to stop the spread of COVID-19, many regions have met the criteria to move into the next stage of our reopening plan, including a decrease in new daily cases and sufficient hospital capacity in the event of any spikes in cases or outbreaks,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Our regional approach recognizes that different regions in the province are experiencing COVID-19 differently and can safely and gradually ease restrictions and reopen local businesses. We will continue to monitor any shifts in the spread and take decisive action to contain any outbreaks."" The government, in partnership with health and safety associations, has released more than 100 health and safety guidance documents at Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to help employers in multiple sectors ― including retail, restaurant and food services and child care ― keep spaces safe for workers and customers. As they prepare to reopen, employers are strongly advised to review these guidance documents and implement appropriate measures to help protect their workers and customers. ""Ontario employers have the information and the tools they need to keep workers safe,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""That includes safety guidelines, posters and tip sheets to promote safe workplaces and help stop the spread of COVID-19. I strongly advise everyone to visit Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to read, download, print and post them, for your sake and the sake of those around you."" ""Since the beginning of this pandemic, our government has worked together with Ontario's business community to mobilize our manufacturing and innovation might to develop made-in-Ontario solutions,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""As we proceed into Phase 2 of the reopening process, we will continue to support both businesses and workers as we move forward on the path to economic recovery together.""

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Permits More Businesses and Services to Reopen in the Coming Days News Release Ontario Permits More Businesses and Services to Reopen in the Coming Days Restrictions Being Eased in Communities Where It Is Safe to Do So June 8, 2020 1:15 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced that it is getting more people back to work and more recreational activities open by moving forward with a regional approach to Stage 2 of reopening the province. In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and local health officials, the government is easing restrictions in communities where it is safe to do so, based on trends of key public health indicators such as lower rates of transmission, increased capacity in hospitals, and progress made in testing. Effective Friday, June 12, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., the province will increase the limit on social gatherings from five to 10 people across the province, regardless of whether a region has moved to Stage 2. Additionally, all places of worship in Ontario will also be permitted to open with physical distancing in place and attendance limited to no more than 30 per cent of the building capacity to ensure the safety of worshippers. Public health unit regions allowed to move into Stage 2 on Friday, June 12 at 12:01 a.m. include: Algoma Public Health Brant County Health Unit Chatham-Kent Public Health Eastern Ontario Health Unit Grey Bruce Health Unit Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit Hastings Prince Edward Public Health Huron Perth Public Health Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health Leeds Grenville & Lanark District Health Unit Middlesex-London Health Unit North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit Northwestern Health Unit Ottawa Public Health Peterborough Public Health Porcupine Health Unit Public Health Sudbury & Districts Region of Waterloo Public Health and Emergency Services Renfrew County and District Health Unit Simcoe-Muskoka District Health Unit Southwestern Public Health Thunder Bay District Health Unit Timiskaming Health Unit Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health Details of the Stage 2 reopening were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""We are able to make this announcement today because of the extraordinary effort of our frontline workers and every other person in the province who helped to stop the spread of this deadly virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""Entering Stage 2 means parts of the province will see more people back on the job and an opportunity to get back together with friends and family. Although this is extremely encouraging, I urge everyone to exercise caution and continue to follow public health advice as we are not out of the woods yet."" Businesses and services permitted to reopen with proper health and safety measures in place in regions entering Stage 2 include: Outdoor dine-in services at restaurants, bars and other establishments, including patios, curbside, parking lots and adjacent properties; Select personal and personal care services with the proper health and safety measures in place, including tattoo parlours, barber shops, hair salons and beauty salons; Shopping malls under existing restrictions, including food services reopening for take-out and outdoor dining only; Tour and guide services, such as bike and walking, bus and boat tours, as well as tasting and tours for wineries, breweries and distilleries; Water recreational facilities such as outdoor splash pads and wading pools, and all swimming pools; Beach access and additional camping at Ontario Parks; Camping at private campgrounds; Outdoor-only recreational facilities and training for outdoor team sports, with limits to enable physical distancing; Drive-in and drive-through venues for theatres, concerts, animal attractions and cultural appreciation, such as art installations; Film and television production activities, with limits to enable physical distancing; and Weddings and funerals, with limits on social gatherings to 10 people. As more people return to work, the services they rely on will need to be available regardless of the stage a region is in. The province will soon release more details on: Child care; Summer camps; Post-secondary education pilots to help people graduate; Training centres; and Public transit. ""The health and long-term economic well-being of the people of Ontario has guided every decision we have made in response to COVID-19,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Chair of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. ""The people and employers of Ontario have demonstrated responsible behaviour throughout the global pandemic. I'm confident that will continue in Stage 2 and beyond. Our collective health and the economic recovery of the province depend on it."" At the beginning of each week, the government will provide an update on the ongoing assessment of these regions, and whether they are ready to move into Stage 2 at the end of the week. Everyone, regardless of where they live in the province, must continue to follow public health advice, including to practise physical distancing, wear a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, wash hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened. ""As a result of efforts of all Ontarians to stop the spread of COVID-19, many regions have met the criteria to move into the next stage of our reopening plan, including a decrease in new daily cases and sufficient hospital capacity in the event of any spikes in cases or outbreaks,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Our regional approach recognizes that different regions in the province are experiencing COVID-19 differently and can safely and gradually ease restrictions and reopen local businesses. We will continue to monitor any shifts in the spread and take decisive action to contain any outbreaks."" The government, in partnership with health and safety associations, has released more than 100 health and safety guidance documents at Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to help employers in multiple sectors ― including retail, restaurant and food services and child care ― keep spaces safe for workers and customers. As they prepare to reopen, employers are strongly advised to review these guidance documents and implement appropriate measures to help protect their workers and customers. ""Ontario employers have the information and the tools they need to keep workers safe,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""That includes safety guidelines, posters and tip sheets to promote safe workplaces and help stop the spread of COVID-19. I strongly advise everyone to visit Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to read, download, print and post them, for your sake and the sake of those around you."" ""Since the beginning of this pandemic, our government has worked together with Ontario's business community to mobilize our manufacturing and innovation might to develop made-in-Ontario solutions,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""As we proceed into Phase 2 of the reopening process, we will continue to support both businesses and workers as we move forward on the path to economic recovery together.""

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Protecting Agri-Food Workers during COVID-19 News Release Ontario Protecting Agri-Food Workers during COVID-19 Government investing $15 million into health and safety measures for farm operations June 12, 2020 10:00 A.M. Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs WOODSTOCK — The Government of Ontario is taking additional steps to better protect workers in the agri-food sector during the COVID-19 outbreak. The province is significantly expanding the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program and committing up to $15 million to enhance health and safety measures on farms and in food processing facilities. ""Agri-food businesses and their hardworking employees play a critical role in keeping our food supply chain strong, providing us with fresh, high-quality and nutritious food all year round,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Today's investment will allow farmers to adapt to this new environment and implement additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 outbreak."" The Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program provides cost-share funding for farmers to purchase Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and implement workplace modifications and other measures. By significantly expanding the program, farmers can take additional steps to improve health and safety for their workers and ensure the continued supply of locally grown food during the COVID-19 outbreak. Today's announcement more than triples the previous investment through this program by the governments of Canada and Ontario. Both levels of government had committed a total of up to $4.5 million for farmers and provincially licensed meat processors to enhance worker safety under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership program. Some of the measures already approved through this program include purchases of PPE, temporary housing for ill workers, building physical barriers for worker separation, enhanced hand washing facilities and a tent rental to expand lunch room space. The Ontario government is also supporting producers and other operations that experience unexpected costs for short-term accommodation and transportation as a result of the impacts of COVID-19. Quick Facts The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) will deliver cost-share funding for the Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program. OMAFRA has also partnered with the Workplace Safety & Prevention Services (WSPS) to provide agri-food businesses, organizations and associations with educational resources, tools and consulting services to help them implement COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Additional details about businesses that may qualify can be found on the WSPS website. The Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development recently released safety guidelines for employers to help protect workers, customers, and the general public from COVID-19. Health and safety inspectors are now working with employers in the agri-food sector to help ensure the safety of employees, including temporary foreign workers. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency provides information on COVID-19 for industry. Today’s announcement is part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. This $17 billion immediate response to the global pandemic provides urgent and direct support to help businesses, workers, seniors, families, students, Indigenous peoples and communities, and vulnerable populations during COVID-19. The action plan includes $3.3 billion of additional resources for health care, $3.7 billion to support people and jobs, and it makes available $10 billion in support for people and businesses through tax and other deferrals to improve their cash flow, protecting jobs and household budgets.

90598,20200612,news.ontario.ca,https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2020/06/ontarians-encouraged-to-establish-social-circles.html,text/html,text/html,en,"Newsroom : Ontarians Encouraged to Establish Social Circles COVID-19: Get the latest updates or take a self-assessment. Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontarians Encouraged to Establish Social Circles News Release Ontarians Encouraged to Establish Social Circles Creating a Close Group of up to 10 People Will Help Reduce Social Isolation June 12, 2020 1:30 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — People throughout Ontario are being encouraged to establish a social ""circle"" of no more than 10 people who can interact and come into close contact with one another without physical distancing. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, updated public health advice to come into effect immediately province-wide to allow social circles of up to 10 members, including those outside the immediate household. Social circles will support the mental health and well-being of Ontarians and help reduce social isolation. Details on how to establish a social circle were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Williams. ""At the outset of the pandemic, we had to make the necessary, but difficult decision to ban large public gatherings and strongly advise physical distancing with everyone except immediate household members"" said Premier Ford. ""As the public health trends improve and our collective efforts start to pay off, we're now able to take another step forward today by allowing families and their loved ones to reunite and spend time with one another safely through social circles."" Ontarians who wish to form a safe social circle should follow these five simple steps: Start with your current circle: the people you live with or who regularly come into your household; If your current circle is under 10 people, you can add members to your circle, including those from another household, family members or friends; Get agreement from everyone that they will join the circle; Keep your social circle safe. Maintain physical distancing with anyone outside of your circle; and Be true to your circle. No one should be part of more than one circle. The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle. ""Ontarians should think of their circles as the people they can touch, hug and come into close contact as we continue our shared fight against COVID-19,"" said Minister Elliott. ""While this is an exciting step forward, every Ontarian should follow the advice provided by our public health experts to ensure they do so safely and in a way that limits the spread of this virus, including and especially by only being part of one circle. We all owe it to each other to act responsibly."" The rules for social circles are different from the proposed expansion of social gatherings from five to 10 people. Social gatherings can be any 10 people from outside your household, but where physical distancing of at least two metres should be maintained. For example, the expansion of social gatherings enables individuals and families to enjoy the company of others at backyard barbeques and picnics in neighbourhood parks, while respecting physical distancing advice. On the other hand, social circles will enable Ontarians to enjoy close contact with members of their circle. This could include hugging, carpooling, enjoying a patio and sharing a meal without staying two metres apart. Ontarians should avoid close-contact activities with anyone outside of their circle if they are unable to maintain physical distancing. Social circles will also bring back supports from people outside of their household who can now help with children, seniors or those in need. ""Not only will social circles help to improve people's mental health and reduce social isolation, they will support rapid case and contact tracing by limiting the number of close contacts, in the event of a case of COVID-19 in that circle,"" said Dr. Williams. While physical distancing does not need to be practised between members of the same social circle, other public health advice, including frequent hand washing, should be maintained. Anyone who is ill or feeling sick should immediately limit their contact with anyone in their circle, inform the other members of the circle, self-isolate, and seek testing if they have COVID-19 symptoms, by visiting one of the 145 assessment centres across Ontario. They should also seek testing if they are concerned that they might have been exposed to COVID-19 or be at risk. Quick Facts Anyone who is ill or feeling sick should immediately stop contact with anyone in their social circle, seek assistance from a health care professional or consider being tested for COVID-19. The number of COVID-19 assessment centres is changing regularly. People are encouraged to check the ministry website (https://covid-19.ontario.ca/assessment-centre-locations) or their local public health unit. Individuals at higher risk, including those over 70 and individuals with compromised immune systems and/or underlying medical conditions, may choose not to participate in a social circle depending on their unique circumstances. While physical distancing does not need to be practised inside the social circle, other public health advice, including frequent hand washing, respiratory etiquette, and not touching your eyes, nose or mouth should be maintained.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario and Canada Helping Small Businesses Go Digital News Release Ontario and Canada Helping Small Businesses Go Digital $57 Million Investment in Digital Main Street Will Help Businesses Reopen, Recover and Grow Long after COVID-19 June 11, 2020 10:00 A.M. Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade TORONTO — The Ontario government, in partnership with the federal government, is helping small businesses reach more customers through the Digital Main Street platform. It is a $57-million program which will help up to 22,900 Ontario businesses create and enhance their online presence and generate jobs for more than 1,400 students. The new program was unveiled today by Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, joined by Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. ""Ontario's small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and their recovery is critical to Ontario's recovery,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""As thousands of small businesses across the province closed their doors and halted business during the COVID-19 outbreak, many struggled to shift sales or services online. I am very pleased, that together with Minister Joly and our federal partners, we are providing small businesses with the tools they need to recover, and flourish, as Ontario reopens."" Through the $57-million contribution to the Digital Main Street platform, businesses will be able to take advantage of three new programs to support their digital transformation: shopHERE powered by Google will leverage Ontario's strengths by hiring highly skilled and trained students to build and support the launch of online stores for businesses that previously did not have the capacity to do so themselves. The core goal will be to help small businesses compete and grow, in a world that is increasingly online, and help them recover as quickly as possible following COVID-19. Digital Main Street Grant will help main street small businesses be digitally more effective. Through a $2,500 grant administered by the Ontario BIA Association, small businesses will be able to adopt new technologies and embrace digital marketing. Municipalities, Chambers of Commerce, and Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) can apply for a Digital Service Squad grant, which will allow them to establish teams to provide personalized, one-on-one support. Future-Proofing Main Street will provide specialized and in-depth digital transformation services and support that helps existing main-street firms adapt to changes in their sector and thrive in the new economy. By leveraging teams of digital marketing professionals and talented students, these firms will be able to create new online business models, develop and implement digital and e-commerce marketing strategies, and maximize digital tools, platforms and content. In addition, the Recovery Activation Program, operated through the Toronto Region Board of Trade, will help businesses grow and digitize their operations with custom consulting sessions, online resource sharing, learning webcasts and business planning. As a result of the investment announced today, the program will be offered province-wide and at no cost to businesses. ""As local economies across Ontario reopen, we're focused on ensuring that our main streets don't just survive, but thrive,"" said Mélanie Joly, Canada's Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario.""These businesses are the backbone of our economy, a source of local jobs - and local pride. Thanks to the expanded Digital Main Street platform, they'll be able to expand their offerings and take advantage of more and more people shopping online. Our message to Ontario's small businesses and those whose livelihoods rely on them is clear: we're working with you to support good jobs and help our economy come back stronger than ever."" ""The global marketplace is rapidly changing, and in order to compete and succeed Ontario must adapt,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""By using innovative tools and technologies, Digital Main Street will help our businesses in expanding their reach to meet new markets and adjust to the new realities of doing business during the pandemic and into the next phase of economic recovery."" About 60 percent of Ontario's small enterprises have a website, and only seven percent have an online payment solution. Digitally, Canadian businesses are estimated to be two years behind their U.S. counterparts. In response, the Ontario government is providing significant support to small business. Along with the Digital Main Street platform, the province is investing an additional $150 million in rural broadband which will help open the digital road for many Ontario small businesses. In addition, the province has proposed a ban on commercial evictions to help businesses that have been impacted by restrictions due to COVID-19. Quick Facts The Ontario Government reduced the small business Corporate Income Tax rate by 8.7 percent starting January 1, 2020. This will deliver up to $1,500 in annual savings to more than 275,000 businesses. Ontario’s Small Business Success Strategy, launched prior to COVID-19, identified the need for small businesses across the province to build or enhance their online presence to remain competitive and expand their markets. The 2020 pandemic has further reinforced the need for Ontario small businesses to embrace digital tools, including having online storefronts and expanding them. To further support small businesses with physical storefronts impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, Ontario is Proposing a Temporary Ban on Commercial Evictions. The planned expansion of these Digital Main Street programs, including ShopHERE powered by Google and the Future-Proofing Main Street program, are the next evolution in efforts to help businesses embrace digital tools that began with the City of Toronto. Through the leadership of Mayor John Tory and the City of Toronto, the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA) pioneered the creation of Digital Main Street and laid the foundation for it to be expanded and scaled-up to serve businesses across the province. The expansion of the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas’ (TABIA) Digital Main Street platform and program is delivered by the Ontario Business Improvement Area Association (OBIAA) with the financial support of the provincial and federal governments. shopHERE is a Digital Main Street program operated by TABIA. TABIA will also support the delivery of the Future-Proofing Main Street program, along with Communitech and Invest Ottawa. The Recovery Activation Program is operated by the Toronto Region Board of Trade.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks TORONTO — As part of the Ontario government's Stage 2 reopening plan, more facilities and services will be available at provincial parks in certain regions beginning on June 12, 2020. Gradually over the next several weeks, Ontario Parks will start opening campgrounds, providing more washrooms and drinking water, along with roofed accommodations, park store and rental operations, visitor centres, and sports fields. It's important to check what facilities and services are available before visiting a provincial park. ""Due to the tremendous progress we have made to contain the spread of COVID-19, more services and activities will soon be available at our provincial parks,"" said Jeff Yurek, Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. ""While this is encouraging, it is not business as usual. I encourage everyone to be responsible and continue to follow public health advice, including physical distancing, when enjoying our outdoor amenities."" The following is a list of recreational activities and facilities that will be opening soon at provincial parks in regions entering Stage 2: On June 12, beaches at Ontario Parks will begin opening to the public as maintenance and water testing are completed. On June 15, campers enrolled in this year's Ontario Parks' Seasonal Campsite Program will now have access to their campsites at the majority of participating provincial parks. Those who were preselected in 2019 for the program will be contacted by Ontario Parks directly regarding the status of their reservation. Beginning the week of June 22, all other campgrounds in regions entering Stage 2 will gradually open at provincial parks, along with washrooms, water taps and trailer sanitation stations. Roofed accommodations (e.g., yurts, cabins and lodges, where available), park store and rental operations, visitor centers, and sports fields will be phased in over the next several weeks. Facilities such as showers, laundry, group camping, picnic shelter rentals and swimming pools will remain closed for the rest of the 2020 season. Visitors should check OntarioParks.com to see what facilities and services are available before visiting a provincial park. To help protect visitors and staff, Ontario Parks will be implementing measures to address overcrowding and promote physical distancing in park spaces and buildings during busy visitation times, by limiting occupancy for day-use and camping in select provincial parks. This may include limiting the number of daily vehicle permits sold or the number of campsites available for reservations. Ministry officers will be present in provincial parks to provide information, assist with emergencies and enforce provincial park rules and regulations. Additionally, these areas may be patrolled by local police or other enforcement agencies. Quick Facts Any reservations for campgrounds (and select backcountry campsites that currently remain closed) up to and into the week of June 22 will be automatically cancelled and you will receive a full refund with no penalty. To ensure the safety of visitors and staff, Ontario Parks will continue to be guided by public health advice and will continually assess and adjust operational and safety protocols as required. Ontario Parks manages 340 provincial parks and 295 conservation reserves, covering over nine million hectares of land in the province. Ontario Parks operates almost 19,000 campground campsites throughout the province.

Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government has developed a plan for the gradual and safe resumption of in-person instruction at postsecondary institutions across the province for the summer term. The plan was developed in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Starting in July 2020, limited in-person education and training may restart for students who were not able to graduate due to COVID-19 closures. This first phase will allow institutions to reopen to provide in-person instruction to students in essential, frontline, and high labour market demand areas, such as nursing, personal support workers, engineering, and other critical professions. Thousands of students across the province could benefit from this summer's reopening. In September, all students will have the opportunity to attend postsecondary education through virtual learning, in-class instruction, or hybrid formats. ""Whether it's donating PPE, researching a vaccine or treatment, or helping with contact tracing, our students, researchers and postsecondary community in Ontario have stepped up in a big way to support our frontline health care workers in response to COVID-19,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""Now, we have to have their backs and make sure our students can keep learning, in class or virtually, and become the next generation of frontline heroes, innovators and community builders."" The limited summer reopening will help individual institutions prepare for the fall term by ensuring proper health and safety protocols are in place. The province is developing a framework to be released to the sector in the coming days, which will provide guidance on the summer reopening and on health and safety measures. Publicly assisted colleges and universities, Indigenous Institutes, private career colleges and other postsecondary education institutions may participate in this voluntary reopening. Institutions that choose to participate will be responsible for establishing their own plans for this limited reopening in accordance with public health advice and any ministry guidance. ""It's critical that we allow students to complete their studies and graduate so they can join the workforce in high-demand, frontline roles and help put the province back on the path to prosperity,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""I will continue to collaborate with the postsecondary sector to determine how best to move forward on reopening our campuses in the fall and beyond in a way that is responsible and safe for our students and staff."" In order to maintain Ontario's position as a global leader in higher education and research, the government will also begin working on a digital and academic modernization framework this summer. Through this exercise, it will look at unlocking the potential of virtual learning, adapting postsecondary education and training to meet the needs of a rapidly changing job market and economy, increasing the accountability of postsecondary education, developing the necessary physical and digital infrastructure, and fully realizing the value of research, innovation, and intellectual property licensing in the domestic and global marketplace. Quick Facts In 2018-19, more than 800,000 students enrolled in Ontario’s colleges, universities, Indigenous Institutes and private career colleges located in every region of the province. Led by the work of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, and in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts, the government is planning a measured and phased approach outlined in A Framework for Reopening our Province.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Helping Parents Return to Work News Release Ontario Helping Parents Return to Work Province Reopening Child Care with Strict Protocols to Keep Kids and Staff Safe June 9, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced its plan to reopen child care centres across the province to support the next stage of the province's reopening framework. Developed in consultation with Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and medical leaders at The Hospital for Sick Children, the plan will require child care operators to follow strict health protocols to ensure the safety of child care staff and children. Details of the plan were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""As we prepare to reopen more businesses and services, it is critical that we ensure supports are in place so people can return to work knowing their children will be cared for in a safe and healthy environment,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our child care plan sets out strict protocols that must be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We have made great progress to contain the virus, but we must be mindful that there is still a public health risk."" As the province continues to implement its Framework for Reopening the Province, child care centres and home care providers across Ontario will be able to reopen with strict safety and operational requirements in place, similar to the safety guidelines required for emergency child care centres. Centres will be required to adopt specific rules, including: Cohorting ― putting children and staff in groups of 10 or less day over day; COVID-19 response plan ― all child care settings will be required to have a plan in place if a child, parent or staff member/provider is exposed to COVID-19; Screening ― all staff and children must be screened prior to entry to the child care setting. Anyone feeling unwell must stay home; Daily attendance records ― child care settings must keep daily records of all attendees in order to support contact tracing; Cleaning ― child care settings must be thoroughly cleaned before opening and frequently thereafter; No visitors ― only essential visitors are permitted entry into the child care setting; Implementing drop-off and pick-up protocols in a way that facilitates physical distancing. Effectively immediately, staff can re-enter child care facilities and begin preparation for reopening. When these operators have met all the strict and stringent guidelines for reopening, they will be permitted to reopen. ""We know the integral role child care plays in the restart of Ontario's economy, especially when it comes to enabling parents to return to work,"" said Minister Lecce. ""But parents must have confidence in the child care system at this very difficult time. By imposing specific public health requirements, we are signaling our firm commitment to keeping our children, staff, and our families safe."" The Ministry of Education has been working with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development to develop these health and safety protocols. They will enable the safe reopening of child care centres across the province and enhance safety through effective contact tracing. This plan imposes strict requirements on operators, including mandatory training and reporting and support from the local medical officer of health before reopening. ""Having children safely re-engage in learning, play and social activities with other children is of great benefit to their mental, emotional and behavioural development,"" says Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids). ""Children thrive when they are able to interact with other children. The reopening of child care centres is an important step forward for allowing children to be with their peers and enjoy activities outside of their home environment."" Based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and with strict health and safety protocols in place, the government is now enabling summer day camp programs across the province to reopen this summer. Strict health and safety guidelines were developed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with public health, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and municipalities, and distributed to local public health teams earlier this month. At this time, overnight camps are not permitted to operate in the summer of 2020. Quick Facts As the province continues to move forward with its reopening plan, emergency child care will wind down effective June 26, 2020 as all licensed child care centres are permitted to open province-wide. Families served through emergency child care will be supported by service system managers to return to their previous arrangement or finding new space during the transition back to regular childcare. As child care reopens across the province, if families are not offered access to their previous child care arrangement, operators will continue to be prevented from charging fees for these spaces. Ontario is also helping parents pay for the extra costs associated with school and child care closures during the COVID-19 outbreak with the Support for Families program, by providing a one-time payment of $200 per child up to 12 years of age, and $250 for those with special needs up to 21 years of age, including children enrolled in private schools. To date, over 1.5 million families have benefited from the Support for Families program. The existing child care funding formula will be leveraged to support enhanced cleaning costs and the health and safety requirements set out to support the reopening of child care centres, as well as the continued stabilization of the sector. As required by legislation, the Ministry will be seeking input from families and the sector on the Child Care and Early Years Act (CCEYA) over the summer, which will inform child care planning for the province. There are over 5,500 child care centres and 124 licensed home child care agencies across Ontario.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Prepares for the Safe Reopening of Schools News Release Ontario Prepares for the Safe Reopening of Schools Province Releases School Safety Plan for the 2020-21 School Year June 19, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government released its safety plan for the resumption of class for the 2020-21 school year, outlining scenarios for how students, teachers and staff can safely return to classrooms in September. The plan also provides choice to parents, enhanced online learning, and additional funding. While the decision to return to the normal school day routine will continue to be based on medical advice, boards and schools are being asked to plan for alternative scenarios that may need to be implemented in September depending on the province's COVID-19 situation. ""Nothing is more important than protecting our kids in this province. Parents expect us to take every precaution to keep their children safe when they go back to school in September - and that's exactly what we're delivering today,"" said Premier Ford. ""This plan takes the best medical advice available from our public heath experts to ensure every school board and every school is ready to ensure students continue learning in the safest way possible."" Ontario's plan to safely reopen schools will provide options for parents - to send their children in-class or to enter online learning - with health, safety and well-being at its core. Boards will be asked to plan for the following three scenarios to be implemented in September, depending on the public health situation at the time: Normal school day routine with enhanced public health protocols - Students going to school every day, in classes that reflect standard class size regulations. Modified school day routine - Based on public health advice, an adapted delivery model has been designed to allow for physical distancing and cohorts of students. Under this model, school boards are asked to maintain a limit of 15 students in a typical classroom at one time and adopt timetabling that would allow for students to remain in contact only with their classmates and a single teacher for as much of the school day as possible. This model would require alternate day or alternate week delivery to a segment of the class at one time. At home learning - Should the school closure be extended, or some parents choose not to send their child back to school, school boards need to be prepared to offer remote education. Remote education should be delivered online to the greatest extent possible, including the establishment of minimum expectations for students to have direct contact with their teacher at the same time on a regular basis, also known as synchronous learning. Synchronous learning can be used as part of whole class instruction, in smaller groups of students, and/or in a one-on-one context. The government is instructing school boards to be prepared with a plan, should it be required, that includes an adapted delivery model, which could include alternate day or alternate week attendance, staggered bell times and recess, and different transportation arrangements, among a variety of other considerations to ensure the safety of students and staff. The government's safety plan for schools was created following extensive consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, health experts on the COVID-19 Command Table, medical experts at The Hospital for Sick Children, education sector partners, frontline workers, parents and students. While this plan reflects the best medical and scientific advice and recommendations available, parents who do not feel comfortable having their children physically return to school will have a choice to pursue online remote learning. ""We are taking every precaution, investing more, and listening to the best medical advice in the country to keep students, staff, and families safe,"" said Minister Lecce. ""I want to assure parents safety is our guiding principle and the right supports are being put in place to ensure our students are set up for success. I am grateful to Ontario students, education staff, and communities for stepping up during this difficult period."" ""Having careful plans in place to reopen schools in September is of the utmost importance for the mental and developmental health of children and youth, as well as their academic success,"" says Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of SickKids. ""The risk posed by COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, however, there are significant steps that can be taken to mitigate risk and protect the health and well-being of students, staff and their families."" Key elements of the safety plan include: guidance for developing health and safety protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment; expectations of an in-class school environment; professional development training for teachers on the new protocols and directions; supports for students with special education needs; enhanced mental health and well-being supports; proposals on how educators and students can move fluidly between in-class and remote learning; guidelines to help schools and boards in their communications with students and parents; guidelines for student transportation systems; expectations for the delivery of curriculum and assessment across subjects and grades; guidance for working with First Nations students, parents and communities; regional options for reopening based on the advice of local public health authorities; and a checklist to help boards in their reopening planning. Moreover, the government announced $4 million in net new funding for cleaning, cleaning protocols, and financial support to hire additional custodial staff in September to ensure schools are safe. School boards have been asked to prepare their own safety plans for the upcoming school year and submit them to the ministry by August 4, 2020. The ministry will be providing all boards with an opportunity to share their draft plans and seek feedback from a formalized table of medical experts that the ministry will be convening. School boards will also be required to communicate with parents and students prior to the start of the 2020-21 school year, outlining the safety plan, guidance on health and safety measures and protocols, and any other changes that will be implemented when schools open in September. Quick Facts Ontario is investing an additional $736 million in public education for the 2020-21 school year, for a total of $25.5 billion. This funding, provided through the Grants for Student Needs (GSN) program, represents the largest investment in public education in Ontario’s history. The Ministry of Education is working in partnership with school boards to deliver high-speed internet to all schools in Ontario, with all high schools having access to broadband by September 2020, and all elementary schools having access by September 2021. As of March 31, 2020, broadband modernization has been completed at 1,983 schools, including 403 northern schools. Installation is currently in progress at 2,954 schools, including 99 northern schools. School boards, in collaboration with their local public health units, are encouraged to refer to Transport Canada’s recently issued Federal Guidance for School Bus Operations as part of their student transportation planning. On March 20, 2020, the Ministry of Education unveiled the Learn at Home / Apprendre à la maison portal, which provides online resources for families and students while schools remain closed. Through the Ontario Together web site, the province identified over 30 proposals from businesses, organizations and everyday Ontarians to provide solutions to remote learning while schools are closed during the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Pauses Commercial Evictions News Release Ontario Pauses Commercial Evictions Government protecting small businesses as the province safely and gradually reopens June 17, 2020 9:35 P.M. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government passed the Protecting Small Business Act, temporarily halting or reversing evictions of commercial tenants and protecting them from being locked out or having their assets seized during COVID-19. The legislation applies to businesses that are eligible for federal/provincial rent assistance for evictions from May 1, 2020 until August 31, 2020. ""We know COVID-19 has had a significant impact on small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""This Legislation will allow us to protect small businesses and help them get back on their feet so they can continue to create jobs and participate in the rebuilding of the provincial economy."" Landlords and tenants are encouraged to participate in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses. The pause on evictions does not apply to those participating in CECRA for small businesses, as the program requires landlords to enter into a rent reduction agreement with their impacted small business tenants and commits them to a moratorium on evictions for three months. ""Pausing evictions of commercial tenants is another way we are supporting small businesses and providing much needed relief as we work to reopen the economy,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Chair of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. ""Working with the federal government, we are providing more than $900 million in relief to tenants and landlords in Ontario through the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses."" Quick Facts In partnership with the federal government, Ontario is committing $241 million to CECRA for small businesses, which will provide more than $900 million in support for small businesses and their landlords. CECRA for small businesses provides forgivable loans to eligible commercial landlords for the months of April, May, and June 2020. Small business landlords would be asked to forgive at least 25 per cent of the tenant's total rent, tenants would be asked to pay up to 25 per cent of rent and the provincial and federal governments would share the cost of the remaining 50 per cent. Tenants and landlords can learn who is eligible and how to apply at Ontario.ca/rentassistance. The application deadline is August 31, 2020.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Enhancing COVID-19 Case and Contact Management News Release Ontario Enhancing COVID-19 Case and Contact Management Province’s Exposure Notification App Important Pillar of Plan June 18, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — As the province safely and gradually reopens, the Ontario government is enhancing case and contact management to quickly test, trace and isolate cases of COVID-19 to stop the spread of the virus and prepare for any potential future waves. These additional measures include a comprehensive case and contact management strategy, Protecting Ontarians through Enhanced Case and Contact Management, and, in partnership with the federal government, a new made-in-Ontario national app called COVID Alert. Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health. The government's enhanced strategy focuses on strengthening and standardizing case and contact management by: Ensuring that all new cases and their close contacts are identified early, contacted quickly, investigated thoroughly and are followed up with daily for up to 14 days; Supporting public health units with up to 1,700 additional staff from Statistics Canada; Improving technology tools by modernizing the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) through the implementation of a new custom-built COVID-19 case and contact management system; and Launching a privacy-first exposure notification app to alert Ontarians when they may have been exposed to COVID-19. ""You can't manage what you can't measure. That's why our government has been relentless in building our testing and contact tracing capacity to track, trace, and contain the invisible enemy we face,"" said Premier Ford. ""As we take our contact tracing strategy to the next level today, I want to thank the federal government for providing more boots on the ground and supporting a privacy-first app that will protect both Ontarians and Canadians alike."" ""Along with the early detection of new cases through the ongoing implementation of our enhanced testing strategy, more effective and efficient case and contact management will ensure that we are able to stop the spread of COVID-19 as we gradually reopen the province,"" said Minister Elliott. ""To support these efforts, we are dramatically expanding staffing levels and getting on with the long-overdue work of replacing outdated systems that no longer meet the needs of public health units."" Ontario is providing updated case and contact management guidance for all public health units to ensure consistency across the province. To continue to ensure cases and their contacts are reached in a timely and effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, public health units will: Connect with cases, and with all individuals who have had close contact with a positive case, within 24 hours of being identified; Direct all close contacts to self-isolate for up to 14 days; Follow up with close contacts every day for the duration of their self-isolation; and Advise testing of all appropriate close contacts. To augment the current provincial capacity of approximately 2,000 case managers and contact tracers, Ontario is providing additional contact tracing staff. New and expanded capacity will be provided through Statistics Canada with access to up to 1,700 additional staff, available to all provinces, for contact tracing. Public Health Ontario will continue overseeing the training and coordination of these additional resources. Over the summer and into the fall, Ontario will continue to build a supplementary pool of contact tracers from the Ontario Public Service and the broader public sector for additional surge capacity, as required. This will allow public health units to perform their other critical functions, including inspections of food premises and water in recreational facilities, and vaccinations. To help Ontarians stay safe as the province reopens and social interactions increase, Ontario will be partnering with the federal government to launch COVID Alert, a new privacy-first exposure notification app, within the next two weeks. The made-in-Ontario app was developed by the Ontario Digital Service (ODS) and a group of volunteers from Shopify. One of the overarching principles is ensuring the privacy and security for all users, which is why the government will leverage BlackBerry volunteer expertise to audit the security and privacy of the application, in addition to the province's internal security reviews. Users will be able to voluntarily download the app and be notified anonymously if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days. In Ontario, the app will also provide users with quick access to Ontario's public health advice and resources, and recommend any necessary actions, such as monitoring for symptoms, self-isolation or appropriate next steps on getting tested. Using a national application will help ensure that Ontarians are notified, regardless of which province they are in, helping us towards the goal of ensuring we can all move more freely and safely. Ontario is also implementing a new user-friendly case and contact management system that will integrate with COVID-19 laboratory results from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS) data, making current processes significantly more efficient and reducing the administrative burden for public health unit staff. A single central system will enable the province to identify provincewide regional trends and hotspots, while protecting personal health information. Custom-built on the Salesforce platform, the new system will also allow for a remote workforce, enabling contact tracing to be quickly ramped up when required. Everyone should continue to follow public health guidelines to stay safe, including physical distancing with people not in your social circle, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing your hands thoroughly and frequently, and, if you think you have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, getting tested. Quick Facts iPHIS was implemented in phases starting on April 1, 2005, with full implementation across the province by the end of that year. Approximately 97 per cent of new COVID-19 cases are currently being reached by local public health officials within one day, with guidance and direction to contain community spread. The exposure notification app will not collect personal or location data. It uses Bluetooth technology to send out encrypted, anonymized codes to other nearby phones that have the app. The app was built using the Apple/Google framework for exposure notification to ensure that it leverages global best practices to protect privacy. No Ontarian will be declined a test at an assessment centre (either through appointment or walk-in, per the processes of each individual assessment centre), especially those who are symptomatic or who are concerned they have been exposed to COVID-19. Visit Ontario’s website to find your local assessment centre and whether you need to call ahead to make an appointment.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Extends Emergency Orders News Release Ontario Extends Emergency Orders Province Focuses on Safe, Gradual Approach as Reopening Continues June 17, 2020 7:00 A.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government has extended all emergency orders currently in force under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. This extension will be in effect until June 30, 2020 to ensure the government continues to have the necessary tools to safely and gradually reopen the province, while continuing to support frontline health care workers and protect vulnerable populations from COVID-19. ""Extending these emergency orders gives our frontline health care providers the necessary flexibility to rapidly respond to urgent needs and protect our most vulnerable,"" said Premier Ford. ""Even though we're seeing decreasing infection rates with increased testing levels, we can't let our guard down just yet. We need to keep these emergency measures in place to support our frontline heroes and we must all continue following the public health advice, so we can reopen more of the province safely and gradually."" While current emergency orders will remain in place until the end of the month, the government will continue to review each one on an ongoing, case-by-case basis to determine when and if they can safely be adjusted or lifted, as part of the province's framework to safely reopen the province. Over the past week, the government announced 31 public health unit regions across the province may proceed to Stage 2 of its Framework for Reopening the Province. This will allow additional businesses and services to reopen and more people to return to work. In addition, larger social gatherings of up to 10 people are now allowed in all parts of the province, and people are encouraged to create or join a social circle. Social circles are different from social gatherings. Social gatherings of people from outside your household are limited to 10 people. A social circle is voluntary, but if adopted should include all household members, and can include family and friends outside the household up to a maximum of 10 people in the social circle, who can interact and come into close contact with one another without physical distancing. To learn how to create a social circle, please see the step-by-step guide. To help stop the spread, people should continue to follow public health guidelines, including practising physical distancing, wearing a face covering where physical distancing is a challenge and washing their hands thoroughly and frequently. Anyone who is worried they may have COVID-19, or who may have been exposed to the virus, is encouraged to go for testing.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Marks Three Months Since Declaration of Emergency Statement Ontario Marks Three Months Since Declaration of Emergency Province Enters Stage 2 of Reopening Amidst Extraordinary Progress in Stopping the Spread of COVID-19 and Protecting Public Health and Safety June 17, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement reflecting on the province's response to an unprecedented international public health crisis: ""Three months ago, our government made the difficult, but necessary decision to enact a provincial Declaration of Emergency in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, closing down non-essential businesses and limiting organized public events and social gatherings. It marked the beginning of one of the darkest periods in our province's history. Our government, joined by thousands of frontline health care workers, volunteers, businesses, and the 14.5 million people who call this province home, rallied immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19. The collective call to action was inspiring, but as we all know, it has been a long and difficult road with losses far greater than anyone could have imagined. I am proud and grateful for how everyone from every corner of the province has gone above and beyond in the face of this global crisis. Since the first sign of the outbreak, we have been laser-focused on supporting our frontline workers and building the capacity that our health care system needed to respond to this threat. Thanks to the diligent work of our hospitals and their top-notch staff, Ontario now has a total of 21,425 acute care beds and 3,276 critical care beds, 2,583 of which are equipped with ventilators. During the peak of the outbreak, the system freed up between 5,000 and 6,000 acute care beds, and had preparedness plans in place to go up to 11,000 acute care beds if needed. Within weeks, we built a network of over 30 laboratories to ramp up our testing capacity, starting at about 3,000 per day in March to reaching over 20,000 a day in recent weeks. Ontario now leads the country in testing capacity. Public health units have also increased their capacity to conduct rapid case and contact tracing, respond to outbreaks, and support local response efforts. We have been tireless in our efforts to ensure frontline workers have the personal protective equipment (PPE) they need to carry out their heroic work in hospitals, long-term care homes and other care settings. We mobilized the manufacturing might of Ontario to make the PPE we need here at home and to showcase ""Ontario Made"" as the gold standard worldwide for quality medical supplies and equipment. Through the Ontario Together portal, thousands of leads on emergency supplies have resulted in more than $610 million in purchases of critical equipment, including 10,040 ventilators, 123 million masks, four million face shields, 173 million surgical gloves, and 21 million gowns. To fortify the iron ring of protection around our seniors, we have provided our long-term care homes with $243 million in emergency funding to hire staff, purchase supplies, and increase capacity. Thanks to our hospital partners, rapid response teams are working with 150 of our long-term care homes across the province to support infection protection and control and staffing needs. We are also incredibly grateful to our brave men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces who have been deployed to provide critical support in seven of our long-term care homes. Above all, the people of this province have shown the true Ontario spirit with countless individuals volunteering in their communities and caring for those in need. Thanks to our partnership with Spark Ontario, over 4,300 volunteers have signed up to help people affected by COVID-19. Thousands of volunteers, including retired nurses and medical students, put up their hand to manage the phone lines at Telehealth Ontario and assist with case management and contact tracing. Through Ontario's Health Workforce Matching Portal, over 24,400 volunteers have asked to be matched with organizations in need of help, including our long-term care homes. As we work to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, we must remain ready for any scenario. I will continue to press the federal government to provide the necessary long-term and sustained funding commitment that will ensure Ontario has the strong health care system and the strong economic recovery it deserves. Our province alone faces up to $23 billion in additional cost pressures related to health care, protecting our most vulnerable seniors, and supporting our municipal partners in delivering critical services. Ottawa must come to the table with serious commitments to funding support. I want to thank each and every person in Ontario for their collective efforts during this unprecedented time. As we gradually reopen our economy, we will continue to support Ontario families and businesses, so they can get back on their feet quickly and get back to work safely. These are the challenges that define a province and its people. While tough times still lie ahead of us, if we stick together and keep looking out for each other, we will come back stronger than ever before.""

Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is providing employers with a new general workplace guide, which will help them develop a safety plan to better protect workers, customers and clients. The new downloadable toolkit offers tips on how to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as more people get back on the job during Stage 2 of the reopening of the province. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""As more regions enter Stage 2 of reopening, we want to give businesses the tools and resources they need to adapt and succeed in this new environment,"" said Premier Ford.

It includes information on the use of face coverings, as well as applying controls in the workplace, from most important to least important. It also includes information on what personal protective equipment may be needed for workers. The government's first general workplace guide is accompanied by a template that employers can fill in to develop their own unique COVID-19 safety plan. The materials will help employers: Identify the risks for transmitting the virus through person-to-person contact and actions such as touching faces with hands that have been contaminated by contact with surfaces and objects; Determine what controls are needed to help mitigate risk, such as engineering controls like the installation of plexiglass to separate workers from customers, administrative controls limiting the number of workers in a space at one time, and personal protective equipment including face and eye protection; Create a workplace safety plan based on the identified risks and appropriate controls specific to the employer's workplace; Implement the plan in the workplace, and review and update it as the situation evolves; and Communicate the actions being taken to workers and other people entering the workplace. The new guide is supported by 121 workplace resources available at Ontario.ca/covidsafety to help protect workers from the virus. They include safety guidelines and helpful posters with tips for 28 distinct sectors such as construction, food, agriculture, manufacturing and long-term care. These materials were developed by the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development in consultation with provincial health and safety associations. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and safety of workers and others during these unprecedented times,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""I strongly encourage all employers in the province to visit our website at Ontario.ca/covidsafety. The tools are there. The resources are there. The most up to date information is there. As more businesses reopen, we want to ensure they are able to adapt to this new environment quickly and efficiently.""

Ministry of Infrastructure Niagara Falls, Ontario, June 25, 2020—The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the Governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy. That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit and active transportation infrastructure play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work and essential services on time then safely back home at the end of the day.

Office of the Premier TORONTO ― In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government has extended the provincial Declaration of Emergency under s.7.0.7 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to July 15, 2020. This extension, approved by the Ontario Legislature earlier today, provides Ontario with the additional time, flexibility, and the necessary tools to safely and gradually allow more places to reopen, while continuing to support frontline health care providers in the fight against COVID-19. ""As we gradually and safely reopen our economy, our frontline care providers can continue to rely on these emergency orders to better protect our seniors and most vulnerable citizens and provide the flexibility to put resources where they're needed most,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are hopeful that another extension of the Declaration of Emergency will not be needed as we see improvements in the public health trends and as people and businesses continue to act responsibly and adapt to the new environment."" The provincial Declaration of Emergency enables the government to make, and as needed amend, emergency orders that protect the health and safety of all Ontarians. Emergency orders in force under the Declaration of Emergency include those allowing frontline care providers to redeploy staff to areas most in need, limiting long-term care and retirement home employees to working at one home, and enabling public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support the province's enhanced case management and contact tracing strategy. These measures continue to be needed to protect seniors and other vulnerable populations from the threat of COVID-19. The extension of the Declaration of Emergency will allow the province to make or amend emergency orders as needed as it continues to ease restrictions in support of its phased reopening. In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the government will continue to monitor public health trends related to COVID-19 and assess on an ongoing basis whether the provincial Declaration of Emergency needs to be extended further. The government will also continue to review emergency orders currently in place to determine when and if it is safe to amend or lift them as more places in the province are allowed to reopen in a safe and measured way. As of June 24, 33 public health unit regions have entered Stage 2 of the Framework for Reopening our Province, allowing more businesses and services to open and getting more people back to work. The Windsor-Essex County public health unit region remains in Stage 1 and the situation in the region will continue to be assessed on an ongoing basis.

Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is allowing more businesses and services to open and getting more people back to work by moving the City of Toronto and Peel Region into Stage 2 on Wednesday. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the local medical officers of health. It is based on positive local trends of key public health indicators, including lower transmission of COVID-19, ongoing hospital capacity, public health capacity to do rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing. ""Today's announcement is another sign that we continue to make steady progress,"" said Premier Ford. ""We have been working hand-in-hand with our municipal partners and local public health units to safely and gradually reopen the province. We will do everything we can to get our final region, Windsor-Essex, into Stage 2 as soon as possible. That's why we are ramping up testing and inspections on Ontario's farms to protect workers and keep our food supply chains strong and healthy."" Toronto Public Health and Peel Public Health will enter Stage 2 on Wednesday, June 24, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. They will join the 31 other public health regions that entered Stage 2 on June 12 and 19, 2020. ""Because of our collective efforts, we continue to make real and significant progress in stopping the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As a result, more regions have met the public health criteria to move into Stage 2 and reopen more services for the communities to enjoy. Just as importantly, these efforts to stop the spread have ensured that we aren't seeing spikes in cases in those regions that have been open for well over a week now."" Windsor-Essex will remain in Stage 1 and the situation in the region will continue to be assessed on an ongoing basis. To ensure the region is able to move forward as soon as it is safe to do so, the province is building on the work completed by Windsor-Essex County Health Unit to date and collaborating with federal and local authorities to support the implementation of a targeted and collaborative response that includes: Continuing with proactive targeted testing for agri-food workers, including enhanced on-farm testing; Conducting more than 200 Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development on-farm inspections and investigations; Starting new joint inspections of farms with federal authorities to review current working and living conditions of temporary foreign workers with the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development and local public health officials; Providing $15 million through the Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection program, which provides cost-share funding to improve employee and workplace health and safety on farms and in processing facilities. The funding can be used to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), put up physical barriers, make housing modifications, or provide alternate housing or other measures; Translating COVID-19 health and safety guidance documents into Spanish and posting them on Ontario.ca/covidsafety. Additional resources, including webinars and helpful posters, are also available, and will help farmers and other agri-food employers provide safe and healthy workplaces; Providing specific funding to Workplace Safety and Prevention Services to deliver resources and consulting services to help farmers and other agri-food businesses provide safe workplaces; and Continuing to press the federal government to provide new funding to support priority sectors impacted by COVID-19, including the agricultural sector, as the province reopens and charts a path to economic recovery. ""Our government is committed to protecting our agri-food workers who continue to produce the safe and healthy foods Ontarians rely on,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Expanded on-farm proactive testing, more workplace inspections and additional resources like our $15-million Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program are part of our coordinated effort to safeguard our farm workers."" The Chief Medical Officer of Health has also strongly recommended that local medical officers of health use their authority under section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act to issue class orders to ensure that employers of temporary workers take actions to decrease the risk of transmission of COVID-19 on farms. These actions will ensure: All foreign workers self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their arrival, with the resources and supports they need to avoid any contacts with others and notification to public health unit if they have any COVID-19 symptoms; All workers coming from any area where there is community transmission have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours prior to beginning work; Daily active screening; Accurate and updated contact information of permanent, temporary and contract employees available to the public health unit within 24 hours and ensuring employees are assigned to the same group to support effective case management and contact tracing; Physical distancing maintained between workers as best as possible and personal protective equipment to be provided based on risk assessment; and All legislative requirements to protect worker health and safety are followed. ""COVID-19 has changed the way people work and interact with each other ― both on and off the farm,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training, and Skills Development. ""Our ministry, together with its health and safety partners, has worked hard to get important information to employers and workers in the agricultural sector. I encourage you to access these documents at Ontario.ca/covidsafety."" With this enhanced response, and continued support from the entire Windsor-Essex community, the government is confident Windsor-Essex County Health Unit region will proceed to Stage 2 soon. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in all regions of the province to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened. Although restrictions are being gradually relaxed in Stage 2, the government is strongly recommending that everyone in Ontario follow public health advice, including physical distancing, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Quick Facts Every Monday, the government is providing an update on the ongoing assessment of the different regions, and whether they are ready to move into Stage 2. To get tested, people should visit Ontario's website to find their local assessment centre and whether they need to call ahead to make an appointment. Stage 3 will focus on reopening more workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually relaxing restrictions, and sustaining and expanding workplace health and safety guidance. The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Enhancing COVID-19 Case and Contact Management News Release Ontario Enhancing COVID-19 Case and Contact Management Province’s Exposure Notification App Important Pillar of Plan June 18, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — As the province safely and gradually reopens, the Ontario government is enhancing case and contact management to quickly test, trace and isolate cases of COVID-19 to stop the spread of the virus and prepare for any potential future waves. These additional measures include a comprehensive case and contact management strategy, Protecting Ontarians through Enhanced Case and Contact Management, and, in partnership with the federal government, a new made-in-Ontario national app called COVID Alert. Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health. The government's enhanced strategy focuses on strengthening and standardizing case and contact management by: Ensuring that all new cases and their close contacts are identified early, contacted quickly, investigated thoroughly and are followed up with daily for up to 14 days; Supporting public health units with up to 1,700 additional staff from Statistics Canada; Improving technology tools by modernizing the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) through the implementation of a new custom-built COVID-19 case and contact management system; and Launching a privacy-first exposure notification app to alert Ontarians when they may have been exposed to COVID-19. ""You can't manage what you can't measure. That's why our government has been relentless in building our testing and contact tracing capacity to track, trace, and contain the invisible enemy we face,"" said Premier Ford. ""As we take our contact tracing strategy to the next level today, I want to thank the federal government for providing more boots on the ground and supporting a privacy-first app that will protect both Ontarians and Canadians alike."" ""Along with the early detection of new cases through the ongoing implementation of our enhanced testing strategy, more effective and efficient case and contact management will ensure that we are able to stop the spread of COVID-19 as we gradually reopen the province,"" said Minister Elliott. ""To support these efforts, we are dramatically expanding staffing levels and getting on with the long-overdue work of replacing outdated systems that no longer meet the needs of public health units."" Ontario is providing updated case and contact management guidance for all public health units to ensure consistency across the province. To continue to ensure cases and their contacts are reached in a timely and effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, public health units will: Connect with cases, and with all individuals who have had close contact with a positive case, within 24 hours of being identified; Direct all close contacts to self-isolate for up to 14 days; Follow up with close contacts every day for the duration of their self-isolation; and Advise testing of all appropriate close contacts. To augment the current provincial capacity of approximately 2,000 case managers and contact tracers, Ontario is providing additional contact tracing staff. New and expanded capacity will be provided through Statistics Canada with access to up to 1,700 additional staff, available to all provinces, for contact tracing. Public Health Ontario will continue overseeing the training and coordination of these additional resources. Over the summer and into the fall, Ontario will continue to build a supplementary pool of contact tracers from the Ontario Public Service and the broader public sector for additional surge capacity, as required. This will allow public health units to perform their other critical functions, including inspections of food premises and water in recreational facilities, and vaccinations. To help Ontarians stay safe as the province reopens and social interactions increase, Ontario will be partnering with the federal government to launch COVID Alert, a new privacy-first exposure notification app, within the next two weeks. The made-in-Ontario app was developed by the Ontario Digital Service (ODS) and a group of volunteers from Shopify. One of the overarching principles is ensuring the privacy and security for all users, which is why the government will leverage BlackBerry volunteer expertise to audit the security and privacy of the application, in addition to the province's internal security reviews. Users will be able to voluntarily download the app and be notified anonymously if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days. In Ontario, the app will also provide users with quick access to Ontario's public health advice and resources, and recommend any necessary actions, such as monitoring for symptoms, self-isolation or appropriate next steps on getting tested. Using a national application will help ensure that Ontarians are notified, regardless of which province they are in, helping us towards the goal of ensuring we can all move more freely and safely. Ontario is also implementing a new user-friendly case and contact management system that will integrate with COVID-19 laboratory results from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS) data, making current processes significantly more efficient and reducing the administrative burden for public health unit staff. A single central system will enable the province to identify provincewide regional trends and hotspots, while protecting personal health information. Custom-built on the Salesforce platform, the new system will also allow for a remote workforce, enabling contact tracing to be quickly ramped up when required. Everyone should continue to follow public health guidelines to stay safe, including physical distancing with people not in your social circle, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing your hands thoroughly and frequently, and, if you think you have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, getting tested. Quick Facts iPHIS was implemented in phases starting on April 1, 2005, with full implementation across the province by the end of that year. Approximately 97 per cent of new COVID-19 cases are currently being reached by local public health officials within one day, with guidance and direction to contain community spread. The exposure notification app will not collect personal or location data. It uses Bluetooth technology to send out encrypted, anonymized codes to other nearby phones that have the app. The app was built using the Apple/Google framework for exposure notification to ensure that it leverages global best practices to protect privacy. No Ontarian will be declined a test at an assessment centre (either through appointment or walk-in, per the processes of each individual assessment centre), especially those who are symptomatic or who are concerned they have been exposed to COVID-19. Visit Ontario’s website to find your local assessment centre and whether you need to call ahead to make an appointment.

Office of the Premier TORONTO ― As the province safely and gradually reopens, the Ontario government is investing $3 million to provide free online health and safety training for the first time. These virtual courses will make it easier for job seekers and workers to get essential qualifications, while practising physical distancing and preventing the spread of COVID-19. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""In this new environment, we need to look for new and innovative ways to deliver services, while keeping people safe and healthy,"" said Premier Ford. ""This virtual approach to safety training will ensure employers and employees have access to the latest information without the need to physically interact with others. In this way, we also reduce the risk of spreading this deadly virus."" Up to 100,000 job seekers can now take free online workplace health and safety training through Employment Ontario. There are 10 courses on offer, which include topics such as infection control, conducting health and safety incident investigations, ladder safety, slips, trips and falls prevention, and preventing workplace violence and harassment. Job seekers should contact an Employment Ontario service provider in their area to enroll. ""This is the first time this type of online safety training has been made available at no cost to people who have lost their jobs and I am confident it will be an effective way to prepare people to rejoin the workforce safely,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""The training is free and accessible from anywhere, so people can learn from their own homes."" In addition, worker and employer members of Joint Health and Safety Committees can now use video conferencing to take training in real-time with qualified instructors from training providers approved by Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer. The training includes sessions on how to establish a Health and Safety Committee, resolving health and safety issues, workplace inspections, and accident investigations. Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer is extending the time for completion of refresher training for more than 8,000 certified committee members whose certification would have expired between February 28 and August 31, 2020. They have until November 30, 2020 to renew their training, which will be easier thanks to new online options. Quick Facts Employment Ontario serves more than one million clients per year and has more than 700 service locations across Ontario. A Joint Health and Safety Committee’s primary role is to identify workplace health and safety issues and bring them to the attention of the employers.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Increasing Oversight of Towing Industry News Release Ontario Increasing Oversight of Towing Industry Provincial Task Force to Look at Improving Safety, Consumer Protections and Industry Standards June 29, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO ― The Ontario government is establishing a task force to improve provincial oversight of the towing industry. The task force will help develop a regulatory model that will increase safety and enforcement, clarify protections for consumers, improve industry standards and consider tougher penalties for violators. The government is taking this action in response to concerns raised about incidents of criminal activity and violence in the towing industry. Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""The party's over for the bad actors who are engaged in violence and criminal activity in the towing industry. We're going to keep working with our police partners to bring these criminals to justice,"" said Premier Ford. ""Setting up this task force will help us bring together experts to develop ways to better protect drivers, operators and inspectors."" The task force will review a number of topics related to the towing industry, which could include provincial oversight of safety, consumer protection, improved industry standards, training and background checks. As part of the review, the task force may consider opportunities for increased protections for consumers against the first-to-scene unethical business practices, insurance savings through a crackdown on insurance fraud rings or improved consumer choice for payments and repairs. The province is also reviewing ways to improve our transportation system by clearing accidents more quickly which would minimize lane reductions and reduce congestion on our highways. ""Most tow truck operators in Ontario are responsible and play a critical role in keeping our roadways safe. However, like all people of Ontario, our government is concerned about the recent reported incidents of violence in the towing industry,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""We are committed to ensuring a higher standard for the tow truck industry and are looking at ways to provide greater oversight of the industry to keep our roads and highways among the safest in North America."" ""When Ontarians are stranded on the side of the road, they need to know their calls will be answered by towing service providers who act safely, ethically and within the law,"" said Solicitor General Jones. ""The task force will help us determine tougher standards for the industry as part of our government's commitment to build safer communities."" Membership of the task force will include representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of the Solicitor General, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, the Ministry of Finance and the Ontario Provincial Police. Once the task force has developed proposals for discussion and comment, it will be consulting with industry, municipalities, and public safety experts. ""Since I first tabled a Private Members' Bill over five years ago calling for better oversight on our roads, the violence and extortion within the towing industry has rapidly escalated,"" said Gila Martow, MPP for Thornhill. ""I look forward to the seeing strengthened provincial oversight of the tow truck industry so we can keep everyone safe."" Quick Facts There are approximately 1,600 tow truck companies registered in the Ministry of Transportation’s Commercial Vehicle Operator’s Registration (CVOR) program. A valid CVOR certificate is required to operate a tow truck. The Consumer Protection Act contains specific tow and storage services rules to help protect consumers who need a tow or roadside assistance in Ontario. The Ontario government is currently reviewing the Act and consumers can provide input through a survey until July 17, 2020, on a number of issues, including towing.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Proudly Supporting Ontario's Manufacturing Sector News Release Proudly Supporting Ontario's Manufacturing Sector Province Supports Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters Launch of “Ontario Made” Program July 10, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier VAUGHAN — As the province safely and gradually reopens, Ontario is starting down the road to growth, renewal and economic recovery. That's why the Ontario government is proud to support the launch of the Ontario Made program from Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME). This new program will promote the many world-class goods that are made across the province by helping consumers easily identify, access and purchase local products. Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Dennis Darby, President and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, at Artistic Skylight in Vaughan, Ontario. ""Ontario has always been Canada's workshop, and our products are recognized as the gold standard across the country and around the world,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our government is proud to support Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters' Ontario Made program. Promoting locally made products will be essential to building a strong, self-sufficient province and key to our economic recovery."" Funding for Ontario Made is made possible through the $50 million Ontario Together Fund launched on April 1, 2020. This funding will be used to help retailers and consumers identify local products by: Creating a new Ontario Made logo that manufacturers can use to help consumers identify their made-in-Ontario products. CME will also meet with major retailers to promote Ontario Made products in-store and increase visibility for customers; Launching a new SupportOntarioMade.ca website that will connect consumers and supply chain partners to manufacturers of made-in-Ontario products through one directory; Promoting Ontario Made through a digital newsletter to raise awareness of Ontario goods and products online and through social media. ""Over the past few months, plants and factories across the province retooled their operations to provide the front lines with the essential equipment needed in the fight against COVID-19, including PPE,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, it is now more important than ever to support and promote Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector and get people back to work. By supporting Ontario manufacturing, consumers are buying quality, locally made products."" In March, the government launched the Ontario Together web portal to encourage companies to submit innovative ideas and ways to provide medical supplies, PPE and other essential equipment. To date, more than 27,000 submissions have been received since the launch of the web portal and 18,000 leads have been converted into more than $658 million in purchases of emergency supplies. In April, the government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund to support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations or deliver innovative solutions in response to COVID-19. ""Ontario manufacturers have a long and proud history of making some of the most innovative products in the world. As consumers increasingly want to buy local, it's important that we help them make informed decisions and find local manufacturers,"" said Mr. Darby. ""We want to encourage Ontario manufacturers to proudly wave the flag by labeling their products and buying local where possible. Ontario Made will help raise awareness of what is manufactured right here by our neighbours, friends, and families and support local manufacturing."" Quick Facts The Ontario government is investing $500,000 from the Ontario Together Fund into the Ontario Made program. CME is a national organization with significant membership in Ontario and across Canada, representing over 30 sector manufacturing associations. To support business owners, workers and the economic recovery of the province, the government launched the Workplace PPE Supplier Directory to provide businesses with information on personal protective equipment suppliers so they can keep their employees, customers and clients safe as they resume their operations.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Introduces Legislation to Protect Public Health as Economy Reopens News Release Ontario Introduces Legislation to Protect Public Health as Economy Reopens Proposed Bill Would Provide Flexibility to Address the Ongoing Threat of COVID-19 July 7, 2020 2:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government introduced proposed legislation that, if passed, would give the province the necessary flexibility to address the ongoing risks and effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed legislation is part of the government's plan for the continued safe and gradual reopening of the province once the declaration of emergency ends. Details about the proposed legislation were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""If passed, the proposed legislation would allow us to chart a responsible path to economic reopening and recovery without putting all the progress we've made in fighting this virus at risk,"" said Premier Ford. ""Even as we continue certain emergency orders under the proposed legislation to protect public health, we will always be a government accountable to the people of Ontario. That's why I will ensure ongoing updates are provided and that a report is tabled within four months of the anniversary of this proposed Act coming into force."" ""While the declaration of emergency may come to an end shortly, the risk posed by COVID-19 is likely to be with us for some time to come,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""This new legislation would provide the government with the necessary flexibility to ensure select tools remain in place to protect vulnerable populations, such as seniors, and respond to this deadly virus."" The Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020 would, if passed, ensure important measures remain in place to address the threat of COVID-19 once the provincial declaration of emergency has ended. Specifically, the legislation would: Continue emergency orders in effect under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) under the new legislation for an initial 30 days. Allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council to further extend these orders for up to 30 days at a time, as required to keep Ontarians safe. Allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council to amend certain emergency orders continued under the EMCPA if the amendment relates to: labour redeployment or workplace and management rules; closure of places and spaces or regulation of how businesses and establishments can be open to provide goods or services in a safe manner; compliance with public health advice; or rules related to gatherings and organized public events. Not allow new emergency orders to be created. Allow emergency orders to be rescinded when it is safe to do so. The ability to extend and amend orders under the new legislation would be limited to one year, unless extended by the Ontario legislature. Appropriate oversight and transparency would be ensured through regular, mandated reporting that provides the rationale for the extension of any emergency order. The legislation would include the same types of provisions on offences and penalties as set out under the EMCPA to address non-compliance with orders. Quick Facts The termination of the provincial emergency declaration under the EMCPA, or the passage of the proposed Act, would not preclude a head of council of a municipality from declaring under the EMCPA that an emergency exists in any part of the municipality or from continuing such a declaration. The termination of the provincial emergency declaration under the EMCPA, or the passage of the proposed Act, would not preclude the exercise of the powers under the Health Protection and Promotion Act by Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health or local medical officers of health. The Government of Ontario declared a provincial declaration of emergency under s.7.0.1 of the EMCPA on March 17, 2020. The declaration has been extended under s.7.0.7 of the EMCPA and is in place until July 15, 2020, allowing the province to continue to make new emergency orders or amend existing orders under the EMCPA until that date. On June 26, 2020, emergency orders then in effect that were made under section 7.0.2 of the EMCPA were extended to July 10. A full list of current emergency orders in effect under the EMCPA can be found on the e-Laws website under the EMCPA and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Ministry of Infrastructure The Ontario government is expanding access to reliable broadband and cellular service in underserved and unserved parts of the province. The application intake for the $150 million Improving Connectivity for Ontario program (ICON) opens today. This funding will help drive economic investment and job creation across the province, while allowing more people to work from home more efficiently, engage in online learning, and connect with family and friends. ""The outbreak of COVID-19 reinforced the need to improve access to reliable broadband and cellular service as more people work and learn from home in order to practice physical distancing,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""By making these investments we will help to ensure every region in the province can participate in the modern digital economy, and contribute to Ontario's economic recovery."" Any areas across Ontario that do not meet the national standards for broadband speeds would be eligible for provincial funding. Up to 12 per cent of households in the province - mostly in rural, remote or northern areas - don't have adequate broadband service, according to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Telecommunication service providers, municipalities, Indigenous communities and non-profits are invited to submit innovative proposals and lend their investment, expertise and experience to improve connectivity in communities across Ontario. The preliminary application deadline for the first intake of the ICON program is August 21, 2020. The province's investment of $150 million announced today is part of the $315 million Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan. This action plan has the potential to leverage up to $1 billion in partner funding for broadband infrastructure investments. Quick Facts On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced the ICON program, a multi-year plan which aims to support approved projects as early as 2021. National standards for adequate broadband service are defined by speeds known as 50/10 (50 megabits per second download, and 10 megabits for upload). Over the past several months, Ontario has partnered with the Eastern Ontario Regional Network (EORN) to leverage $213 million to improve cellular access in eastern Ontario. The Province is investing in the $190 million Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) project to bring high-speed broadband to 50,000 more homes and businesses across Southwestern Ontario. Ontario has invested in initiatives to improve connectivity in Northern Ontario, such as a project that will connect five remote Matawa First Nations communities, seven broadband projects that will support rural and Indigenous communities, and the Next Generation Network Program.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Starting Down the Path to Growth, Renewal and Economic Recovery News Release Ontario Starting Down the Path to Growth, Renewal and Economic Recovery COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act Will Help Create Jobs and Opportunities, Build Stronger Communities July 8, 2020 2:15 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is taking the first step in a made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and economic recovery. Today, the province introduced the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, proposed legislation that lays the foundation to restart jobs and development, strengthen communities, and create opportunity for people in every region of the province. Details of the legislation were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has touched all Ontarians and created significant hardship for individuals, families and businesses,"" said Premier Ford. ""People are relying on our government to help rebuild the province and get people back to work ― and that's exactly what we're doing, starting with this new legislation."" If passed, the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act will: Restart jobs and development to get Ontario's economic engine roaring again by getting key infrastructure projects built faster, attracting more jobs and investment, and cutting red tape to help businesses adapt to the new environment. Strengthen communities by ensuring municipalities are equipped with the tools they need to continue to provide the critical services people rely on every day, including allowing municipalities and their local boards to continue to choose to hold meetings electronically at any time and putting in place a new community benefits charge to help municipalities pay for the infrastructure and services needed for growing communities. Create opportunity for people as they recover their lives and livelihoods by protecting consumers, modernizing services, improving the education system and removing the social and economic barriers that stand in the way of success for young people. ""We are working hand in hand with our municipal partners so they can emerge stronger and better able to meet the needs of local residents,"" said Minister Clark. ""Ontario will continue to be a champion for communities and work closely with the federal government to help every community chart a path to a strong economic recovery."" ""Making Ontario a modern regulator — one that communicates clearly and operates effectively — will free up our people and businesses to focus on what's important: recovering and re-emerging stronger than before,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""By improving digital access to government and incorporating best practices, we're empowering businesses to rebuild, rehire, and return to a period where their success fuels our economic growth. A modern Ontario is better for people and smarter for business."" The government is committed to working in partnership with people, businesses and municipalities to respond to the challenges they face and support the long-term health and prosperity of Ontario's economy. Quick Facts Ontario’s COVID-19: Tackling the Barriers website was created to help businesses overcome the unique challenges created by this pandemic. Through almost 1,300 submissions the government is actively investigating nearly 400 as identified roadblocks. To assist municipalities, the province announced several supports in Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19 (March 2020 Economic and Fiscal Update). This lays the groundwork for nearly $450 million of direct support to assist municipalities in their efforts to support vulnerable people, deferring the June municipal remittance of education property tax to school boards by 90 days, and postponing the property tax reassessment for 2021 to ensure that municipal governments can focus their attention on critical public health initiatives. The $450 million in support includes: $350 million through the Social Services Relief Fund, most of which allows local service managers and Indigenous program administrators to expand supports for our vulnerable people across the province; an additional $100 million to support public health units and Public Health Ontario for the extraordinary costs incurred in meeting this public health threat and in protecting Ontarians. The government is investing $2.6 billion this year to rehabilitate Ontario’s highways and bridges in every corner of Ontario. To get shovels in the ground faster and get more people back to work, the government is making it easier to build this critical transportation infrastructure, which will reduce delays and save taxpayers money.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Canada and Ontario invest in roads and bridges for Southern Ontario communities News Release Canada and Ontario invest in roads and bridges for Southern Ontario communities July 6, 2020 11:45 A.M. Ministry of Infrastructure WELLAND — The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected smaller and rural communities across the province. Both governments are making strategic investments in roads and bridges to meet the specific needs of Ontario communities and help them strengthen their local economies. Today, Vance Badawey Member of Parliament for Niagara Centre, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; Sam Oosterhoff, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Education and Member of Provincial Parliament for Niagara West, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; his Worship Jim Diodati, Mayor of Niagara Falls; his Worship Frank Campion, Mayor of Welland; his Worship Dave Bylsma, Mayor of West Lincoln; and her Worship Kristal Chopp, Mayor of Norfolk County, announced funding for four road and bridge improvement projects in Southern Ontario. The City of Welland will see the construction of a bridge over the Welland Canal at the site of the former Forks Road lift bridge, which was demolished in 2019. The construction of this new bridge will reopen a key transportation link that was used by and estimated 3,500 vehicles daily to access Welland and other parts of the Niagara Region. Other projects include the reconstruction of parts of Drummond Road, Gallinger Street, and Portage Road in the City of Niagara Falls, the replacement of Big Creek Bridge to include a new two-lane structure in Norfolk County, and the reconstruction and rehabilitation of St. Ann's Road and bridge in the Township of West Lincoln. These projects will improve safety for residents and visitors alike, making it easier to get around the region. The Government of Canada is investing more than $9.9 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada plan. The Government of Ontario is also contributing over $6.6 million; and the municipalities involved are contributing over $17.8 million combined to the projects. Quick Facts Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities. $2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity. Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure. The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work. Central to Canada’s Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank. On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced it was investing $150 million to launch the Improving Connectivity in Ontario program to fund broadband infrastructure projects in rural, remote and underserved regions of Ontario. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.

These projects will make travel safer and make it easier for residents, visitors, and local businesses get to where they need to go. We are proud to invest in our communities so that they remain among the best places to live, work and raise a family. Specific to the Forks Road Bridge, this will fill an immediate need for the Dain City community and the surrounding communities of Port Colborne and Wainfleet.” Vance Badawey Member of Parliament for Niagara Centre, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development “Ontario’s investment of more than 6.6 million along with significant contributions from our federal and municipal partners means residents and visitors will get where they need to go more reliably. I can’t wait to see shovels in the ground on these vital projects that will improve local infrastructure, create jobs and strengthen our local economy.” Sam Oosterhoff Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Education and Member of Provincial Parliament for Niagara West, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario’s Minister of Infrastructure “The City of Welland appreciates the contribution from the provincial and federal governments which will be used to replace the Forks Road Canal Crossing. This connection is imperative for the citizens of Welland, especially the residents of Dain City connecting the east and west side of the canal. This will enable faster access to highway and other transportation routes. This funding brings us one step closer to replacing the bridge.” His Worship Frank Campion Mayor of Welland “These infrastructure projects will help upgrade the safety and efficiency of travel throughout our City. We could not be more thrilled about the government’s support of critical projects in our community as we continue to move forward with our maintenance and restoration of roadways, bike lanes and sidewalks.” His Worship Jim Diodati Mayor of Niagara Falls “The partnership between all levels of government shows the great level of importance these projects are to our communities. Infrastructure advancement is a key component in our municipality's strategic plan - We couldn't be more pleased.” His Worship Dave Bylsma Mayor of West Lincoln “This funding announcement is without a doubt one of the most significant contributions ever made to Norfolk County for one of our most critical pieces of infrastructure. The challenges associated with reconstructing a bridge through one of Canada’s most ecologically diverse areas, home to a UNESCO designated world biosphere, cannot be understated. Not only is the causeway bridge the only access point linking the mainland to the homes of hundreds of residents, it also welcomes more than a hundred thousand visitors annually to the Long Point Provincial Park.” Her Worship Kristal Chopp Mayor of Norfolk Count Media Contacts Marie-Pier Baril Press Secretary, Office of the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development marie-pier.baril@cfc-swc.gc.ca 613-295-8123 Christine Bujold Press Secretary, Office of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario’s Minister of Infrastructure christine.bujold@ontario.ca 416-454-1782 Sofia Sousa-Dias Press Secretary, Office of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario’s Minister of Infrastructure christine.bujold@ontario.ca 416-454-1782 Bernice Booth Corporate Communications, City of Welland bernice.booth@welland.ca Share Share this story on Facebook Tweet a link to this story Email this story Print this story Tags Business and Economy Jobs and Employment Rural and North Download Download Text Download Electronic Press Kit Choose which press-ready content you'd prefer to download.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Extends Emergency Orders News Release Ontario Extends Emergency Orders Province Maintains Flexibility to Protect Public Health as Economy Gradually Reopens July 9, 2020 7:00 A.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government, in consultation with Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has extended all emergency orders currently in force that were made under s.7.0.2(4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to July 22, 2020. The extension was made to ensure the province maintains the necessary flexibility to protect public health and safety as more businesses reopen and people go back to work. The extension of the emergency orders will help protect vulnerable people, such as seniors, by allowing the redeployment of frontline staff in long-term care facilities, retirement homes and other congregate care settings, like women's shelters and residential services. In addition, the extension would allow public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support case management and contact tracing. ""Our government is getting Ontario back on track and more people back to work, but at the same time taking steps to ensure we don't undo the tremendous progress we have made together,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""By keeping these emergency measures in place, we will continue to support our frontline care providers, protect our most vulnerable, and ensure we can rapidly respond to potential outbreaks or surges."" The government intends to extend emergency orders to align with the Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020, if passed. This proposed legislation is part of the government's plan to cautiously reopen Ontario in a way that recognizes the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 even after the provincial declaration of emergency has ended. The bill, if passed, would allow Ontario to continue its path to recovery by easing restrictions where appropriate, while maintaining important select tools to address the ongoing threat of this deadly virus and protect Ontarians. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert. Quick Facts The Government of Ontario declared a provincial emergency on March 17, 2020 under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The declaration of emergency was extended and is currently in effect until July 15, 2020. The government brought forward a motion in the Ontario legislature that, if passed, would extend the provincial declaration of emergency until July 24, 2020.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Nearly All Businesses and Public Spaces to Reopen in Stage 3 News Release Nearly All Businesses and Public Spaces to Reopen in Stage 3 Public Gatherings Will Increase in Size as the Province Continues its Path to Economic Recovery July 13, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government announced nearly all businesses and public spaces will reopen in Stage 3 of the province's reopening framework with public health and workplace safety measures and restrictions in place. As Ontario continues down the path to economic recovery, decisions on which regions will enter Stage 3 and when will be made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health experts and based on trends of key public health indicators. Details on the Stage 3 reopening framework were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""Our success in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and getting Ontario to a place where we are ready to reopen most of the province is a testament to the hard work of business owners, individuals and families right across the province,"" said Premier Ford. ""So many have stepped up and played by the rules, demonstrating that we can restart our economy safely and responsibly. Small actions can make a big difference. Now more than ever, we must continue to follow the public health advice to preserve the progress we have made together."" As part of the Stage 3 reopening, Ontario will be increasing gathering limits for those regions entering the next stage to the following: Indoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 50 people; Outdoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 100 people; Gathering limits are subject to physical distancing requirements. Public gathering limits apply to indoor and outdoor events, such as community events or gatherings, concerts, live shows, festivals, conferences, sports and recreational fitness activities, fundraisers, fairs, festivals or open houses. A two metre distance must still be maintained at such events. Regions remaining in Stage 2 will maintain the existing gathering limit of 10. Social circles in all stages at this point will also be kept to a maximum of 10 people province-wide, regardless of stage. The Chief Medical Officer of Health, public health experts and other officials have advised the following, high-risk places and activities are not yet safe to open, even if a region has entered Stage 3, due to the likelihood of large crowds congregating, difficulties with physical distancing, or challenges maintaining the proper cleaning and sanitation required to prevent the spread of COVID‑19: Amusement parks and water parks; Buffet-style food services; Dancing at restaurants and bars, other than by performers hired by the establishment following specific requirements; Overnight stays at camps for children; Private karaoke rooms; Prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports; Saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars; Table games at casinos and gaming establishments. For more information on the restrictions that will remain in place during Stage 3, as well as the public health guidance necessary to keep the people of Ontario safe, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. The province is committed to working closely and collaboratively with businesses and sectors not yet able to reopen or who are experiencing significant challenges for reopening due to Stage 3 restrictions. These businesses can visit Ontario.ca/reopen to work with the government on a reopening proposal that will enable them to safely resume or increase operations. Government and public health officials will review proposals and contact businesses for feedback or clarifications. ""With almost all businesses and services able to resume operations, Stage 3 is a major step forward in our plan to reopen the province,"" said Minister Phillips. ""We have to keep treating each other with respect and acting responsibly to keep up the progress in our fight against COVID-19. Our government will continue working with our partners across Ontario to rebuild our economy so that our province is a place of economic strength and prosperity for every person and family."" The following public health unit regions will be allowed to move into Stage 3 first, on Friday, July 17, 2020: Algoma Public Health Brant County Health Unit Chatham-Kent Public Health Eastern Ontario Health Unit Grey Bruce Health Unit Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit Hastings Prince Edward Public Health Huron Perth Public Health Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health Leeds Grenville & Lanark District Health Unit Middlesex-London Health Unit North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit Northwestern Health Unit Ottawa Public Health Peterborough Public Health Porcupine Health Unit Public Health Sudbury & Districts Region of Waterloo Public Health and Emergency Services Renfrew County and District Health Unit Simcoe-Muskoka District Health Unit Southwestern Public Health Thunder Bay District Health Unit Timiskaming Health Unit Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health Businesses and municipalities will be permitted to enter Stage 3 based on their region and, as in the previous stages, may choose to take more time before reopening. For a list of regions that will remain in Stage 2, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. At the beginning of each week, the province will continue to reassess local trends in public health indicators, including rates of transmission, hospital capacity, progress on testing and contact tracing, to determine if additional public health unit regions can progress to Stage 3. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and other public health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be further loosened or if they need to be tightened or reapplied. ""Having seen a decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province safely re-started over 90 per cent of economic activity with Stage 2, we now have the confidence to move certain regions into Stage 3, including expanding the size of gatherings indoors and outdoors,"" said Minister Elliott. ""As we do, it's never been more important for all Ontarians to continue to practise physical distancing and wear a face covering when doing so is a challenge, such as safely visiting a favourite local store. Together, we'll continue to move Ontario forward."" As the province safely and gradually enters Stage 3, child care centres and home child care providers across Ontario will be able to continue to operate with strict safety and operational requirements in place. Beginning on July 27, 2020, child care centres will be permitted to operate with cohorts of 15 children, which is an increase from the current cohort cap of 10. This change will allow parents to return to work, and bring the child care sector to approximately 90 per cent of its operating capacity before the COVID-19 outbreak. ""Providing child care for parents is critical so that, as more Ontarians return to work, they can do so with confidence in knowing that their children are being safely cared for,"" said Minister Lecce. ""Child care is an integral enabler to the continued restart of Ontario's economy, and we remain committed to working to ensure child care remains accessible, affordable and, most importantly, safe as we gradually increase capacity of Ontario's child care sector."" The government, in partnership with health and safety associations, has released over 170 guidance resources at Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to help employers in multiple sectors ― including fitness, restaurant and food services, and the performing arts ― keep spaces safe for workers and customers. Guidance will be available for all spaces permitted to open in Stage 3. As they prepare to reopen, employers are strongly advised to review and implement appropriate measures to help protect their communities. ""As we enter Stage 3 and continue on the path to economic recovery, it is more important than ever that we support business owners and workers,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""That is why we launched the Workplace PPE Supplier Directory to provide businesses with information on personal protective equipment suppliers so they can keep their employees, customers and clients safe as they resume their operations. By continuing to work together, we will ensure Ontario is prepared and well-supplied for any future challenges."" Based on community needs, some municipalities and local medical officers of health have implemented more restrictions or requirements, such as mandatory face coverings in commercial establishments and all indoor public places. Check your local public health unit's or local municipality's website.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Takes Steps to Strengthen Consumer Protection News Release Ontario Takes Steps to Strengthen Consumer Protection New Act will promote confidence for those purchasing a home and other products July 15, 2020 3:00 P.M. Ministry of Government and Consumer Services TORONTO — Earlier this week, the Ontario legislature approved Bill 159, the Rebuilding Consumer Confidence Act. Once in force, it will promote higher quality new home construction and reduce defects and warranty claims, while better protecting consumers from bad actors in the marketplace. The Act will overhaul Tarion Warranty Corporation and the way it protects new-home buyers with better warranties and more protections than they have had in the past. The Act will include an improved dispute resolution process and help Tarion better protect consumers by helping them get more useful information about home builders and their histories. ""When you get the keys to your new home, you should feel confident that it has been built safely and properly, and that any defects will be taken care of in a timely manner,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""That is why we are rebuilding the Ontario new home warranty and protection program from the ground up, focusing on consumer protections, transparency, access to information, and governance."" Bill 159 also includes improvements to administrative authorities, independent organizations like the Real Estate Council of Ontario and the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, that help protect consumers. The Act includes new powers for the government that will ensure administrative authorities can continue acting in the public interest during emergencies. In addition, Bill 159 will allow for financial penalties under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The people of Ontario count on the CPA everyday in a wide range of situations, including contract cancelations, door-to-door sales and the value of their reward points. The Act will also ensure that prices of tickets for Ontario events are listed and charged in Canadian currency. ""The passage of this bill marks our government's continued commitment to strengthening consumer protection,"" said Minister Thompson. ""We will continue to work with Tarion Warranty Corporation to better respond to the needs of consumers in Ontario and establish a new builder regulator. We will continue to consult with stakeholders to develop regulations that are necessary and needed for the future."" Quick Facts Tarion Warranty Corporation administers the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act which deals with new home warranties, protections, and new home builder and vendor regulation. The Auditor General released a Special Audit of Tarion Warranty Corporation in October 2019, that included recommendations to strengthen how Tarion is run.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Moving More Regions into Stage 3 News Release Ontario Moving More Regions into Stage 3 More Businesses and Services Across the Province Can Safely Reopen on Friday July 20, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is allowing seven more regions to enter Stage 3 on Friday, increasing the number of businesses and public spaces that will reopen across the province. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and is based on positive local trends of key public health indicators, including lower or low transmission of COVID-19, ongoing hospital capacity, public health capacity to conduct rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing. The details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""We're working with communities across the province to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and help more businesses safely and responsibly hang up their 'Open for Business' sign,"" said Premier Ford. ""While we want as many people back to work and taking home a paycheque again as possible, it's important for everyone ― no matter what stage your community is in ― to remain on guard and keep following the public health advice. By working together, we can keep new case numbers down and ensure all of Ontario can enter Stage 3 when it's safe to do so."" The following public health units will be allowed to move into Stage 3 on Friday, July 24, 2020 at 12:01 a.m.: Durham Region Health Department; Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit; Halton Region Health Department; Hamilton Public Health Services; Lambton Health Unit; Niagara Region Public Health Department; and York Region Public Health Services. These regions will join the 24 public health regions that entered into Stage 3 on Friday, July 17, 2020. For more information on the restrictions that will remain in place during Stage 3, as well as the public health and workplace safety restrictions necessary to keep people safe, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. The following regions will remain in Stage 2 until local trends of key public health indicators demonstrate readiness to move into Stage 3: Peel Public Health; Toronto Public Health; and Windsor-Essex County Health Unit. Ontario will continue to assess trends in the public health indicators to determine when these final public health unit regions can progress to Stage 3. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and public health experts also continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be further loosened or if they need to be tightened. ""Building on the success of the regional approach in the previous two stages and based on the positive public health trends we are seeing, we are ready to move more regions across the province into Stage 3,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Entering Stage 3 does not mean the fight against COVID-19 is over. We all must remain vigilant and continue following public health advice to ensure the progress we have made so far in stopping the spread will not be undone."" Businesses not able to open or resume full activities due to Stage 3 restrictions, or businesses that have ideas to safely amend Stage 3 restrictions or requirements, can visit Ontario.ca/reopen to submit a reopening proposal. Government and public health officials will review proposals and contact businesses for feedback or clarifications. Proposals may inform the potential loosening of restrictions as Stage 3 progresses. Proposals will receive initial feedback within 10 days of submission. A sector could be allowed to reopen or resume Stage 3 activities based on proposals submitted by businesses. ""I'm impressed by how seriously business owners are taking the public health advice and how easy they made it for their customers to take precautions,"" said Minister Phillips. ""By providing plenty of space to physically distance, keeping hand sanitizer by the door, and maintaining records for contact tracing, they're playing a vital role helping fight COVID-19. We're all doing our part and making it easy for others to do the same."" As the province carefully reopens, the health and well-being of Ontarians remains a top priority. The government is strongly recommending everyone to continue following public health advice, including practising physical distancing with those outside your household or social circle, wearing a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge or where it is mandatory to do so, staying home when ill, and washing your hands frequently and thoroughly. These measures are critical as more Ontarians return to work and access more businesses and services. Quick Facts For regions in Stage 3, gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 50 people indoors and a maximum of 100 people outdoors, with physical distancing in place. Gathering limits apply to all social gatherings and events, as well as some higher risk activities and venues. Gathering limits do not apply to settings such as beaches, parks, restaurants and bars, but measures to enable physical distancing may limit capacity at any given time. Some municipalities have implemented additional restrictions or requirements, such as mandatory face coverings in commercial establishments and all indoor public places. Check your local public health unit’s or local municipality’s website. For questions on restrictions that will remain in place during Stage 3, review the Stage 3 Emergency Order on the emergency information portal or call the Stop the Spread Business Information Line at 1-888-444-3659. Over 180 guidance resources are available to businesses to help them safely reopen and keep customers and workers safe. The province has set up a Workplace PPE Supplier Directory, where employers can find suppliers who sell personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies to support a safe reopening of their workplaces.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom COVID Alert Available for Download Beginning Today News Release COVID Alert Available for Download Beginning Today Privacy-First, Made-in-Ontario App Notifies Users of Potential Exposure to COVID-19 July 31, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — As Ontarians continue to do their part to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the Ontario government is encouraging everyone to download the new COVID Alert app on their smart phone from the Apple and Google Play app stores. This app, which is available beginning today, lets users know if they may have been exposed to the virus. It is free, easy and safe to use. The more people who download the app, the more effective it will be in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Work on COVID Alert was initiated in Ontario by the Ontario Digital Service and volunteers at Shopify, and was the foundation of the work by the Government of Canada. The app was developed in consultation with the Privacy Commissioners of Canada and Ontario to ensure the highest level of privacy for everyone using it. ""This important, made-in-Ontario COVID Alert app will be a critical part of our case and contact management strategy as more regions in Ontario enter Stage 3 today,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""This innovative tool was developed by some of the best and brightest minds in our province, working in partnership with Ottawa. As businesses open their doors and schools prepare for September, we need to help stop the spread and keep others safe by downloading this COVID Alert app."" The COVID Alert app uses Bluetooth technology to detect when users are near each other. If a user tests positive for COVID-19, they can choose to let other users know without sharing any personal information. Ontarians who receive an exposure alert can then get tested and take action to help keep themselves, their families, and their friends from spreading COVID-19 throughout the community. The app does not collect personal information or health data, and does not know or track the location, name, address, or contacts of any user. ""Built with a privacy-first approach, COVID Alert is a safe and easy-to-use tool that Ontarians can download to protect themselves, their loved ones and their community from COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""This Ontario-made app keeps people informed about being potentially exposed to the virus and allows them to act quickly to stop the spread of the virus. It is a key tool in our case and contact management strategy. I encourage all Ontarians to download the app, as early detection of cases will be important as we continue to carefully reopen more of the province."" COVID Alert is a key tool to strengthen Ontario's comprehensive case and contact management strategy, Protecting Ontarians through Enhanced Case and Contact Management. The app supports the efforts of public health units, allowing the province to quickly test, trace and isolate cases of COVID-19 to stop the spread of the virus and prepare for any potential outbreaks ― without sharing any personal information. ""As Ontario safely and gradually re-opens, we continue to take a digital-first approach to delivering simpler, faster, better services to support Ontarians, including the COVID Alert app, which will leverage technology to protect the health and safety of the people of Ontario,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""By making it easier for Ontarians to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities, we continue to deliver on our commitment to build a smarter government that works for you."" If an app user receives a message from COVID Alert that they may have been exposed to the virus, they should follow the public health advice given on the app and get tested. To notify other people if an app user has tested positive for COVID-19, they can enter their one-time key from Ontario's test results website (Ontario.ca/covidresults) into the app. A message will then be sent to other app users who have been within two metres of them for at least 15 minutes within the past 14 days, without sending any information that identifies the user, or the time and place of exposure. To stay safe as more of the province reopens, Ontarians should continue to follow public health guidelines including physical distancing with people not in their social circle, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing hands thoroughly and frequently, and if anyone thinks they have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, get tested. Quick Facts COVID Alert is available for free use and download from the Apple and Google Play app stores. All aspects of COVID Alert are completely voluntary. Ontarians can choose whether to download the app, whether to use the app after downloading it, and whether to notify others if they test positive for COVID-19. COVID Alert does not collect any personal information, health information, or location data. It uses Bluetooth technology to send out encrypted codes to other nearby app users and was built using the Apple/Google framework for exposure notification to ensure that it leverages global best practices to protect privacy.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Continues to Gradually and Safely Reopen Child Care for Working Parents News Release Ontario Continues to Gradually and Safely Reopen Child Care for Working Parents Strict Protocols and Additional Supports to Keep Kids Safe and Align Child Care with Reopening of Schools July 30, 2020 1:31 P.M. Ministry of Education TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced its plan to allow licensed child care centres across Ontario to open at full capacity starting September 1, 2020. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the COVID-19 Command Table. As a result, parents will be able to return to work knowing their children are in a safe and supportive care setting. EarlyON Child and Family Centres will also be permitted to reopen with in-person programming along with before- and after-school programs for school aged children which will be permitted to operate with standard ratios and maximum group size requirements. All of these programs will be subject to health and safety protocols in order to keep kids safe. ""Our government is gradually and safely supporting child care expansion to ensure moms and dads across the province can return to work with confidence,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""We will continue to ensure strict health and safety protocols remain in place, to keep our youngest learners safe."" The Ministry of Education will continue to work closely with municipal service managers, First Nations, and childcare operators to maximize capacity and access for families over the coming weeks. This includes revised health and safety operational guidance, additional funding parameters, and direction on providing notice to parents for placements. Licensees will continue to be required to maintain ratios and group sizes as set out under the Child Care and Early Years Act, 2014 (CCEYA). The government will continue to follow the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the COVID-19 Command Table to ensure the health and safety of the children and staff is never compromised as childcare capacity expands to 100%. The enhanced health and safety procedures that were put in place as part of our re-opening plan, will remain in place, and in some instances strengthened, to protect children, staff and families, including: Requiring all child care staff to wear masks at all times, effective September 1; Ensuring frequent cleaning of child care centres; Screening of children and staff before entering a childcare facility; Maintaining attendance records for rigorous contact tracing and coordination with local public health authorities; Ensuring frequent hand washing and proper hand hygiene for children and staff; and Establishing clear and rigid case management protocols in the event a staff member or child becomes ill, or tests positive for COVID-19. ""Our commitment to the health and safety of the children and staff, will never waver,"" continued Minister Lecce. ""Child care and early years programs will operate with additional health and safety procedures in place upon fully reopening. And rest assured, if at any time the health and safety of the children is jeopardized, we will take action immediately."" Ontario will also provide additional funding, with support from the federal government through the Safe Restart Agreement, to help child care operators and EarlyON Child and Family Centres purchase cleaning supplies, PPE and support staffing needs related to new procedures. Quick Facts Licensed child care centres will be permitted to operate at full capacity beginning September 1, 2020. More information about reopening protocols and guidelines will be shared in the coming days. Families whose children attended a licensed child care centre immediately before the emergency was declared must be given at least 14 days notice to accept a placement available on or after September 1, 2020. From March 22 – June 26, 2020, the government provided Emergency Child Care to health and front line workers free of charge. On April 10th, 2020, the government committed to protecting parents from financial hardship during COVID-19 by preventing operators from charging fees while child care centres were closed. On May 9th, 2020 the government announced supports to licensed child care providers to ensure they remain sustainable and ready to open when parents return to work. On June 9, 2020, the government announced its plan to reopen child care centres across the province. On June 12, 2020, child care centres were permitted to reopen once strict health and safety measures had been met. Funding is being provided to support enhanced cleaning costs and health and safety requirements set out to support the reopening of child care centres, as well as the continued stabilization of the sector. The government of Ontario will supply face coverings to licensed child care settings and EarlyON locations. There are over 5,500 child care centres and 124 licensed home child care agencies across Ontario. Parents and guardians have until August 31, 2020 to apply for Support for Families. Under this program, parents or guardians of children between 0-12 years old, or up to 21 years old for children and youth with special needs, are eligible for a one-time payment, per child, to purchase educational materials to support learning at home. To date, over 1.6 million families have benefited from the Support for Families program.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Releases Plan for Safe Reopening of Schools in September News Release Ontario Releases Plan for Safe Reopening of Schools in September Province Providing Critical Investments and Resources to Keep Students and Staff Safe July 30, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government is announcing the safe reopening of schools for in-class instruction beginning this September. The government has unveiled a plan that prioritizes the health and safety of students and staff, and provides school boards with unprecedented resources and flexibility, while accommodating regional differences in trends of key public health indicators. This plan was developed in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the COVID-19 Command Table and paediatric experts. Details on the safe restart of the 2020-2021 school year were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health. Elementary schools (Kindergarten to Grade 8) will reopen provincewide, with in-class instruction five days a week. Secondary schools with lower risk will reopen with a normal daily schedule, five days a week, while most secondary schools will start the school year in an adapted model of part-time attendance with class cohorts of up to 15 students alternating between attending in-person and online. Students from Grade 4-12 and school staff will be required to wear masks. ""It's been hard on families to balance work and child care, while kids have been separated from friends and other kids their own age. We want to get our kids back to school, but it has to be done safely,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why we've worked with our public health experts, Ontario Health and the medical experts at SickKids to develop a plan that ensures students can return to the classroom five days a week in a way that protects the health and safety of our children, teachers, and school staff."" Parents will continue to have the option to enroll their children in remote delivery, which respects their fundamental role in making the final determination of whether they feel safe with their children returning to school. Based on the best medical advice available, the province is implementing additional public health protocols to keep students and staff safe when they return to school in September. To support the implementation of these protocols, the government is providing over $300 million in targeted, immediate, and evidence-informed investments, including: $60 million in procurement of medical and cloth masks for students and staff, with direction to boards to ensure that students who cannot afford a mask are provided one; $30 million for teacher staffing to support supervision, keeping classes small and other safety related measures; $50 million to hire up to 500 additional school-focused nurses in public health units to provide rapid-response support to schools and boards in facilitating public health and preventative measures, including screening, testing, tracing and mitigation strategies; Over $23 million to provide testing capacity to help keep schools safe; $75 million in funding to hire over 900 additional custodians and purchase cleaning supplies for schools; $40 million to clean school buses, to ensure that students are in a thoroughly cleaned transportation environment; $10 million for health and safety training for occasional teachers, who have historically not been covered by professional development that is offered to permanent teachers; $10 million to support special needs students in the classroom; and $10 million to support student mental health. This funding is in addition to a $25 million investment in mental health and technology, which will see an additional $10 million dedicated to mental health staff, resources, and programs, as well as $15 million in technology funding to support the procurement of over 35,000 devices for Ontario's students to support their synchronous learning in-school and beyond. ""This plan reflects the best medical and scientific advice with a single aim: to keep your child safe,"" added Minister Lecce. ""While this plan will continue to evolve to respond to the changing threat of COVID-19, we will remain constant and consistent in investing in the resources, staffing, and cleaning supports, and strict health and safety protocols to keep our communities and our classrooms safe."" The Ministry of Education has received clear and compelling public health guidance to inform the delivery of instruction for boards for the 2020-2021 school year. These decisions are adaptable to changing public health situations and were based on the rigorous and data-informed guidance of leading medical, epidemiological, and paediatric leaders in the province. ""Based on the current data, we are seeing that overall instances of COVID-19 are declining in Ontario. When considering the health of the whole child, and as long as this trend continues, we believe that with the appropriate measures and strategies in place to handle potential outbreaks and prevent spread, schools are expected to be a safe place for Ontario's students and staff who attend in person,"" said Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health. ""We will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the safety of students and staff and will be prepared to transition to alternative options should circumstances change."" ""As a society, we've made an important shift in the dialogue about our children and the adverse health impacts of school closures,"" says Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of SickKids. ""While we recognize that COVID-19 will be with us for some time, continuing to stay home from school has become untenable for many children, youth and families. Effective, evidence-based strategies can help promote the safety of students, teachers, school staff and families as they return to school."" The Ministry of Education will continue working closely with public health and school boards to monitor and report on the health status of school communities, which is part of the government's outbreak management plan. This plan, which was developed with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of the Solicitor General and the Ministry of Health, outlines clear protocols and authorities of the multiple agencies and organizations involved in the public health landscape. In the event of positive cases of COVID-19 among students, parents, teachers, or other staff, these protocols will enable immediate action by health and education sector officials to identify, track, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the education system. Every school board will have communication protocols in place to keep families informed. Quick Facts Since June, school boards have been planning for three models of instruction for the 2020-2021 school year: conventional delivery, adapted instruction, and remote instruction, bolstered by live, dynamic synchronous learning. As the public health situation unfolds through the course of the school year, boards will continue to rely on these three models to respond nimbly and pragmatically to local public health dynamics. Over the summer, students and families took advantage of expanded summer learning across the province. Over 150,000 students enrolled in high school programs, including more than 21,000 students who took Reach Ahead credits. Elementary students participated in literacy and numeracy programs and students with special education needs and mental health concerns are participating in new targeted and transition programs in preparation for the coming school year. The government will be releasing a Policy/Program Memorandum (PPM) to school boards to outline the requirements for educators and board staff in utilizing synchronous learning as part of remote and online forms of instruction during the school year. As part of Bill 197, the government enabled a double-cohort of students in the province’s demonstration schools for the 2020-2021 school year, which will provide critical support and learning for students with severe learning needs. This was in direct response to the potential learning and development loss resulting from the school closure as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. On June 19, 2020, the government released a provincial reopening guidance plan to school boards and asked boards to prepare their own restart plans for the upcoming school year, which they will present to the Ministry of Education in early August. The Ministry of Government and Consumer Services will supply key personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to schools. Supplies needed for September are ready to be delivered to schools by mid-August. Prior to school starting, School Mental Health Ontario will provide school boards with a professional learning framework and toolkit to support the mental health of all students that can be tailored at the board and school levels for different audiences. The professional learning will have a strong focus on building students’ social-emotional learning skills so that they can build resilience, manage their stress and build positive relationships. On March 20, 2020, the Ministry of Education unveiled the Learn at Home / Apprendre à la maison portal, which provides online resources for families and students while schools remain closed. Parents and guardians still have until August 31, 2020 to apply for Support for Families. Under this program, parents or guardians of children between 0-12 years old, or up to 21 years old for children and youth with special needs, are eligible for a one-time payment, per child, to purchase educational materials to support learning at home.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Moving Toronto and Peel Region into Stage 3 News Release Ontario Moving Toronto and Peel Region into Stage 3 Following Public Health Protocols Essential as Province Continues Down the Road to Economic Recovery July 29, 2020 8:30 A.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — Additional businesses and public spaces will be reopening as the Ontario government allows the City of Toronto and Peel Region to move into Stage 3 of reopening the province on Friday, July 31 at 12:01 a.m. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and local medical officers of health. It is based on positive local trends of key public health indicators, including lower transmission of COVID-19, ongoing hospital capacity, public health capacity to conduct rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing. Toronto Public Health and Peel Public Health regions will join the 31 public health regions that entered into Stage 3 on July 17 and 24, 2020. ""While more restaurants, theatres and businesses can hang up their Open for Business sign, we're asking everyone to follow public health advice and act responsibly,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We have made tremendous progress that allows us to return to something a little closer to our normal lives this summer, but we are not out of the woods yet. This virus is still among us and we have to be extra cautious to avoid sparking a surge or an outbreak. I strongly urge everyone to continue following public health protocols."" Windsor-Essex County Health Unit region will remain in Stage 2. Ontario will continue to monitor local trends of key public health indicators in the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit region and move it into Stage 3 when it is safe to do so. In the interim, the government continues to address the needs of the region, in partnership with other levels of government, through measures such as on-farm testing, the deployment of mobile testing units and the adoption of new public health guidance for positive asymptomatic workers for all workplaces. ""More businesses and services are able to reopen thanks to the collective efforts of all Ontarians to limit the spread of the virus,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While public health trends across the province are positive, we continue to closely monitor Windsor-Essex so that we can move the community into Stage 3 when the time is right. No matter which stage a region is in, everyone needs to continue to follow public health advice to protect themselves, their families and community."" Ontario is also supportive of proposals made by the City of Toronto and Toronto Public Health relating to restaurants, bars and other food and drink establishments that are permitted to be open. For more information on the restrictions that will remain in place during Stage 3, as well as the public health and workplace safety restrictions necessary to keep people safe, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. Businesses that are unable to open or resume full activities due to Stage 3 restrictions, or businesses that have ideas to safely amend Stage 3 restrictions or requirements, can visit Ontario.ca/reopen to submit a reopening proposal for consideration. Government and public health officials will review proposals and contact businesses for feedback or clarification and provide an initial response within 10 days. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and public health experts also continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be further loosened or if they need to be tightened. It remains critically important for everyone to continue following public health advice as more businesses and services reopen in Stage 3. This includes practising physical distancing with those outside your household or social circle, wearing a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge or where it is mandatory to do so, staying home when ill, and washing your hands frequently and thoroughly. Quick Facts Proposals from the City of Toronto and Toronto Public Health, if adopted, would further limit close contact and interaction in restaurants, bars, and other food or drink establishments. This includes further restrictions on movement/seating and maintaining client logs to support case and contact tracing and limit the spread of the virus. For regions in Stage 3, gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 50 people indoors and a maximum of 100 people outdoors, with physical distancing in place. Gathering limits apply to all social gatherings and events, as well as some higher risk activities and venues. Gathering limits do not apply to settings such as restaurants and bars, however these settings must be configured so that patrons seated at different tables are separated by a distance of at least two metres, plexiglass or some other impermeable barrier. Some local municipalities may have enacted by-laws or local medical officers of health may have issued Section 22 orders under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, mandating the use of face coverings in some settings. Other medical officers of health may have mandated the use of face coverings through reference to emergency orders. Refer to local municipal or public health unit webpages for more information. For questions on restrictions that will remain in place during Stage 3, review the Stage 3 Emergency Order on the emergency information portal or call the Stop the Spread Business Information Line at 1 888 444-3659. Over 180 guidance resources are available to businesses to help them safely reopen and keep customers and workers safe. The province has set up a Workplace PPE Supplier Directory, where employers can find suppliers who sell personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies to support a safe reopening of their workplaces. Testing is available at any of the province’s 144 assessment centres currently open. To find your closest assessment centre, please visit Ontario.ca/coronavirus.

Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries NIAGARA FALLS — The Ontario government is resuming weekend GO train service to the Niagara region beginning on August 1. New schedules with four trips to and from Niagara Falls and St. Catharines each Saturday, Sunday and holiday will provide more service than ever before and enable convenient day or overnight trips, either in Niagara or Toronto.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Historic Agreement Delivers up to $4 Billion to Support Municipalities and Transit News Release Historic Agreement Delivers up to $4 Billion to Support Municipalities and Transit Safe Restart Agreement Represents New Funding for Many Priority Programs in Ontario July 27, 2020 1:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO — The Ontario government, in partnership with the federal government, is providing up to $4 billion in urgently needed one-time assistance to Ontario's 444 municipalities. This funding will help local governments maintain the critical services people rely on every day, including public transit, over the next six to eight months. Details on specific allocations will be provided in the coming weeks. This funding is part of the province's made-in-Ontario plan for renewal, growth and economic recovery. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""By working together, we have united the country in the face of the immense challenges brought on by COVID-19 and secured a historic deal with the federal government to ensure a strong recovery for Ontario and for Canada,"" said Premier Ford. ""I want to thank Ontario's 444 local leaders who supported us through our negotiations with the federal government and through each stage of reopening. We will continue to be a champion for our municipal partners as they safely reopen their communities and ensure people can get back to work."" Premier Ford worked collaboratively with municipal partners, fellow Premiers, Prime Minister Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Freeland to reach this historic agreement, which includes $777 million from the federal government and $1.22 billion from the province in support for municipalities. Ontario will continue to work closely with its municipal partners to ensure this funding provides the support they need to address budget shortfalls related to COVID-19. ""Ontario's municipalities are the backbone of our great province,"" said Minister Clark. ""Our government is committed to working hand in hand with our municipal partners to help them emerge stronger and enable them to lead economic recovery in every community. And the funding we are announcing today will play a critical role in that."" ""Ontario municipalities told us they are dealing with a $4 billion shortfall as a result of COVID-19,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Failing to act could result in cuts to services and higher taxes. That's why, under Premier Ford's leadership, Ontario was a strong advocate at the negotiating table to ensure municipalities and transit systems were supported as part of the Safe Restart Agreement. This is a historic level of support that's being provided during unprecedented times."" Through Ontario's leadership, a deal for public transit funding was also secured as part of the federal-provincial agreement. Up to $2 billion will be shared equally between Ontario and the federal government. Transit operators that have seen steep declines in revenues will receive the support they need to help address the financial impacts of COVID-19 and continue their operations in a safe manner. ""Transit operators across Ontario have done an incredible job ensuring that people who need to get around, including our frontline workers, have safe and reliable transit service during the outbreak,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""This funding will help ensure transit services continue to be there so people can get where they need to go as our province reopens and people return to work."" The Safe Restart Agreement will help ensure a strong and safe recovery for Ontario through investments in testing, contact tracing and data management; health care capacity and mental health; protecting vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness and seniors in long-term care facilities; securing personal protective equipment (PPE); child care for returning workers; and support for municipalities and public transit systems. Quick Facts Ontario has invested about $350 million to support municipalities and social service providers such as shelters and food banks, as well as individuals receiving social assistance and those who are ineligible to receive federal support. Ontario invested $100 million to support extraordinary public health costs incurred in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak and in protecting Ontarians. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ontario government has worked with municipalities to provide them with the tools and supports they need, including enabling them to hold virtual council and local board meetings during emergencies and temporarily extending expiring development charge bylaws to ensure they could continue to collect this vital source of revenue.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Opposes New U.S. Tariffs on Aluminum Imports Statement Ontario Opposes New U.S. Tariffs on Aluminum Imports August 6, 2020 8:00 P.M. Office of the Premier TORONTO ― Today, Premier Doug Ford and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, issued the following statement on the U.S.-imposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum imports: ""We are disappointed that the U.S. has re-imposed tariffs on imports of aluminum products from Canada, particularly at a time when our trade partnership will be essential to our economic recovery. These tariffs undermine the benefits of the highly integrated U.S.-Ontario trading relationship that are set to continue under the new Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA). Ontario does $390 billion CAD in two-way trade with the U.S. every year. We are the top customer of 19 U.S. states and the second top customer to 11 others. Last year, Ontario purchased $2.3 billion CAD in aluminum products from the U.S. alone, supporting hundreds of American jobs and businesses. As one of the U.S.' top customers, these tariffs hurt the mutual prosperity and security that has benefitted our two nations for centuries. While these re-imposed tariffs will have a damaging impact on Ontario businesses, workers and consumers, they will also hurt American businesses and consumers. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 'bringing back these tariffs would be like a bad horror movie. Most of the U.S. aluminum sector opposes them, and they'll hurt American manufacturers who use aluminum as an input.' This sentiment was echoed by The Aluminum Association, which represents more than 120 U.S. companies across the entire industry value chain, saying 'this dynamic is hurting aluminum workers today' and 'efforts to 'Blame Canada' miss the mark.' We welcome the federal government's commitment to defend the interests of Ontario's aluminum sector and businesses in Canada and the U.S. We urge them to press the U.S. administration for immediate and permanent removal of its tariffs on Canadian aluminum, and to ensure that no other trade impediments such as quotas are introduced. Ontario will continue its engagement with our federal and state partners from the U.S. to draw attention to the negative impacts of the tariffs, as well as emphasize the mutual benefits of free and open trade. The economic downturn resulting from COVID-19 is an even greater incentive to maintain our longstanding and positive trade relationships and ensure Ontario businesses have access to the world's markets. The U.S. imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada will negatively impact economic recovery efforts and hurt workers in the U.S. and Canada. Strengthening our unique trading partnership will only ensure that everyday consumers, workers and businesses can emerge from this period of economic uncertainty in a position of strength."" Quick Facts Ontario exports of aluminum and aluminum products totalled approximately $2.6 billion CAD in 2019, of which 94 per cent was exported to the U.S. Ontario global aluminum imports totalled $3.3 billion CAD in 2019, of which 72 per cent came from the U.S. The global uses of aluminum in 2018 included: automotive and transportation (24 per cent), construction (23 per cent), consumer goods (14 per cent), foil and packaging (13 per cent), electrical engineering and electronics (11 per cent), machinery and equipment (9 per cent), and other applications (6 per cent). Nearly one in five Ontario jobs depend on trade, and approximately $400 billion CAD in merchandise trade travels across the U.S. and Canadian border in Ontario every year.

Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, issued the following statement: ""Our government has promised to be there to support people and jobs since the pandemic first hit our province,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""By extending support for commercial rent at the same time most of the province is in stage three, the province of Ontario is helping more businesses get through this challenging period so they have an opportunity to recover and welcome back their customers."" To learn more and apply for the CECRA for small businesses, visit the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's (CMHC) application portal. Quick Facts The province committed $241 million to the program, which would provide more than $900 million in support for small businesses across Ontario during this difficult time.

Office of the Premier TORONTO ― The Ontario government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, is supporting the safe reopening of many sport, fitness and recreation facilities by applying a capacity limit on a per room basis to help more businesses reopen their doors, get more people back to work and promote the return to a healthy and active lifestyle for all Ontarians. Beginning August 15, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., these facilities can have up to 50 patrons for each indoor sport or fitness room, while ensuring physical distancing of at least two metres. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries. ""Many of our gyms and fitness centres are owned and operated by small business owners and they are struggling,"" said Premier Ford. ""To help them get back on their feet and hire back staff, we are making these changes so they can serve more people. I continue to urge everyone to follow the strict public health protocols to ensure everyone can have a safe workout."" The revised capacity limits are on a per room basis. They will apply to the gymnasiums, health clubs, community centres, multi-purpose facilities, arenas, exercise studios, yoga and dance studios and other fitness facilities that are able to follow the new guidance. The change was enabled by amendments to the Stage 3 regulation and a new plan and guidance document to apply a per room limit for sport and recreational fitness activities at facilities with the necessary space or layout. Businesses, not-for-profits, and municipalities may need or choose to take more time before implementing this change in capacity limits. Facilities may also adopt their own protocols that are more restrictive than the guidance. The government will continue to work with sport and recreation organizations across the province on their safe return to sport. Amateur sports in Ontario have been severely impacted, as measures to stop the spread of COVID‑19 cancelled competitions and closed training centres. As access to sports and recreational facilities increases, the government is investing $8 million through the Ontario Amateur Sport Fund to help the province's sports organizations, from Alpine Ontario to WushuOntario and every sport in between, to continue to serve athletes of all levels. The funding will help them continue delivering high-quality programming and competitions to develop athletes, coaches and officials, and to promote health and wellness in communities across the province. ""The government knows it has been a difficult road for the sport and recreation sector these past several months,"" said Minister MacLeod. ""This funding is providing much-needed stability and support to a sector that provides services to many businesses and non-profit organizations. With these changes and investments, we will once again show the world that Ontario is the best place to play sports."" Based on community needs, some municipalities and local medical officers of health have implemented additional restrictions or requirements, such as mandatory face coverings in commercial establishments and indoor public places.

""Here in Ontario, this funding will allow municipalities to offer critical public services, like public transportation and shelters, while they help protect against potential future waves of the virus. Building a stronger and more resilient economy that works for everyone starts with keeping Canadians safe and healthy. Together, we will build on the progress we've made, and put Canadians first as we gradually and safely restart our economy."" In Fall 2020, Ontario's 444 municipalities will receive $695 million in Phase 1 funding to help address municipal operating pressures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding will be allocated on a per household basis and would be shared 50/50 between upper- and lower-tier municipalities. Up to $695 million in additional funding will be available through Phase 2 to eligible municipalities after municipalities have provided the province with information on their estimated COVID-19 related financial pressures. ""The success of Ontario's municipalities is vital to our province's economic recovery,"" said Parliamentary Assistant Jim McDonell. ""We've been working in partnership with municipalities from day one to understand the financial impacts of COVID-19, and this historic agreement will ensure they have the funding needed to address their most urgent local priorities."" In addition to the support for municipalities, the government is providing over $660 million in the first phase of transit funding to the 110 municipalities with transit systems. The funding can be used to provide immediate relief from transit pressures, such as lower ridership, as well as for new costs due to COVID-19, such as enhanced cleaning and masks for staff. In the second phase, additional allocations will be provided based on expenses incurred to ensure the funding meets the needs of municipalities. As part of the Safe Restart Agreement with the federal government, up to $2 billion is being provided to support public transit in Ontario. ""Ontario's public transit systems are critical to supporting the economy and getting people where they need to go as the province gradually reopens,"" said Associate Minister Surma. ""This historic agreement will help ensure that municipalities can continue to provide safe and reliable transit for the people of Ontario."" Ontario is also providing municipal service managers and Indigenous housing partners with an additional $212 million under the Social Services Relief Fund to help protect vulnerable people from COVID-19. This investment can help them protect homeless shelter staff and residents, expand rent support programming and create longer-term housing solutions. This brings the government's total Social Services Relief Fund investment provided to service managers and Indigenous program administrators to $510 million, and builds on the government's COVID-19 Action Plan to Protect Vulnerable Ontarians. Quick Facts The federal Safe Restart Agreement provides more than $19 billion to Canadian provinces and territories to help ensure a strong recovery and support frontline health care, families, and communities. Across all streams of federal investment, the Safe Restart Agreement provides over $7 billion in funding and in-kind supports to Ontario. The agreement provides a total of up to $4 billion in funding to the province’s 444 municipalities and 110 public transit providers. This includes up to $2 billion to relieve municipal financial pressures created by COVID-19: $777 million from the federal government and $1.22 billion from the province. It also includes up to $2 billion for public transit, which will be cost-shared equally between Ontario and the federal government. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ontario government has worked with municipalities to provide them with the tools and supports they need, including enabling them to hold virtual council and local board meetings, and temporarily extending expiring development charge bylaws to ensure they could continue to collect this vital source of revenue. In March, Ontario launched the Social Services Relief Fund with an initial $148 million investment to provide immediate financial relief. Those funds were crucial in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In July, an additional $150 million was committed to help improve shelters and create opportunities for longer-term housing. Today’s $212 million in funding brings the government’s assistance to service managers and Indigenous program administrators to $510 million. Ontario invested $100 million to support extraordinary public health costs incurred in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak and in protecting Ontarians.

To further support disadvantaged youth and job seekers from underrepresented groups, the province is investing $2.2 million to help them develop the skills they need for successful careers. Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities, at Youth Employment Services in Toronto. ""Our government is committed to breaking down barriers and ensuring everyone from all walks of life gets the opportunity to achieve their full potential,"" said Premier Ford. ""To help turn lives around, I am looking forward to receiving the advice of the impressive members of our new Council and seeing the results of our investment in critically important training and skills development programs."" This morning, Premier Ford and Minister Smith attended the inaugural meeting of the Premier's Council on Equality of Opportunity to congratulate Chair Jamil Jivani and all of the new Council members.

The programs will help increase awareness and encourage youth to acquire the skills that will start them down the path to lifelong success while supporting Ontario's economic recovery and future prosperity. Today, Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, announced the investments and the appointment of three industry leaders to advise on attracting youth to the trades, in London at the Children's Museum. ""Ontario's demand for workers in the trades is on the rise, and we want to attract more young and talented people into the exciting and challenging world of trades,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Becoming an ironworker or a sprinkler fitter should be as obvious as becoming a firefighter or a lawyer. Our government is committed to ensuring that all young people across the province have the resources they need to acquire the skills and knowledge they need to get good jobs.""

They will advise on increasing awareness of the skilled trades among elementary school students, starting in grade one, with a focus on grades seven and eight, and on making it easier for high school students to learn about the options in the trades and to begin an apprenticeship pathway while continuing to earn secondary school credits. ""There's a growing demand in the job market for skilled workers"" said Minister Lecce. ""We want to help fill this labour shortage and mismatch with young women and men who can take on these meaningful and well-paid jobs. That is why we are continuing to position Ontario as a STEM leader for the next generation of workers."" ""Today's announcement reflects our government's priority to encourage youth to explore the tremendous opportunities in skilled trades,"" said Jane McKenna, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""A career in the skilled trades is both rewarding and life changing."" Quick Facts There are 144 skilled trades in Ontario. Pre-apprenticeship training programs are publicly-funded, last up to one year, and often combine classroom training with an 8-12-week work placement. Pre-apprenticeship training programs promote careers in the trades for all Ontario residents, including youth at risk, new Canadians, women and Indigenous people. To find out about programs in your area, contact Employment Ontario by phone, e-mail or live chat. Retirements in the skilled trades are contributing to the shortage of skilled workers.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Governments Help Ontario Food Processors become more Innovative and Competitive News Release Governments Help Ontario Food Processors become more Innovative and Competitive Funding will improve food safety and productivity August 27, 2020 10:00 A.M. Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs SIMCOE — The Governments of Canada and Ontario are providing more than $5.4 million through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership to help food processing businesses improve food safety, increase labour productivity and enable better access to markets. These strategic investments will support more than 75 projects across Ontario and strengthen the province's crucial agri-food supply chain. ""Targeted investments into the innovation of our food processors such as these ensure our food supply chain remains strong and competitive for years to come,"" said Neil Ellis, Member of Parliament for Bay of Quinte and Parliamentary Secretary to the federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""This is about serving our communities from both levels of government, helping to give a boost to our local food businesses and address some of the challenges around labour we are seeing right now."" Some specific types of projects supported through this programing include: Implementing technology or other systems to improve food safety. Transitioning to automated, advanced manufacturing and/or robotic processing technology to enhance labour productivity. Developing new products or processes to increase sales. A list of approved projects is posted online at: www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/cap/processor-projects.htm ""Our food processors are an integral part of our province's economic recovery from this outbreak,"" said the Honourable Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""By investing in this sector, we are helping our homegrown processors become more competitive, more innovative and better positioned to keep supplying safe, quality foods for domestic and international markets."" The Partnership is also investing in programs this year at provincially inspected dairy processors and provincially licensed meat processors to support food safety enhancement projects. These are in addition to new programming launched this year, like the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program, to assist the sector in protecting its workers from the COVID-19 outbreak. Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed cost-share support to more than 2,500 projects through the Partnership to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow. Quick Facts The Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments that supports Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors. This cost-share funding is supporting projects in the following key priority areas: Economic development in the agri-food and agri-products sectors. Environmental stewardship to enhance water quality and soil health. Protection and assurance to reinforce the foundation for public trust in the sector through improved assurance systems in food safety and plant and animal health. More than 75 projects were approved following a competitive, merit-based application intake that took place from November 4, 2019 to November 26, 2019.

Skip to main Content Français Newsroomhome page Ontario Newsroom Ontario Expands Indoor Capacity for Meeting and Event Facilities News Release Ontario Expands Indoor Capacity for Meeting and Event Facilities Province also eases contact information requirements for bars and restaurants August 21, 2020 5:00 P.M. Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries The Ontario government is safely reopening more of the economy by easing restrictions for facilities that rent out professional meeting and event spaces. Beginning August 21, 2020, facilities can have up to 50 guests for each indoor meeting room or event space within the facility. The facility would have to adhere to a plan approved by the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. ""As the province gradually and safely reopens, our government is continuing to promote a safe approach to reopening businesses to boost Ontario's economic and social recovery,"" said Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries. ""Allowing for multiple meetings or events will allow convention centres, hotels and other professional meeting facilities to welcome back more visitors and employees."" The current indoor gathering limit will now apply on a per meeting room or event space basis at professional meeting and event facilities, including convention centres, hotels, motels, resorts, banquet halls and conference centres. Outdoor meeting and event facilities remain subject to the 100-person gathering limit for the entire outdoor area. Capacity limits exclude employees or event personnel. Safely allowing these facilities to host more meetings and events is an important step in Ontario's economic recovery. To operate and expand indoor capacity safely during Stage 3 of Ontario's Framework for Reopening Our Province, convention centres, hoteliers and other associations have helped inform the development of a guidance document, which is the plan approved by the OCMOH. These measures ensure public safety based on public health requirements, operational best practices and industry guidelines prepared by the sector. In addition, new regulatory amendments have come into force requiring contact information for only one person in a party entering indoor or outdoor dining areas starting today, with exceptions. This will reduce the administrative burden on businesses such as restaurants, bars and other food and drink establishments, and tour and guide services, while continuing to support case and contact tracing. Businesses not able to open or resume full activities due to Stage 3 restrictions, or businesses that have ideas to safely amend Stage 3 restrictions or requirements, can visit Ontario.ca/reopen to submit a reopening proposal. Government and public health officials will review proposals and contact businesses for feedback or clarifications. Proposals may inform the potential loosening of restrictions as Stage 3 progresses.

Visit Ontario’s website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19. Quotes “As an essential service during this global pandemic, the hotel industry has safely provided accommodation for health care workers, first responders and others on the frontline who required a safe, controlled environment to stay while serving their community. Providing more meeting and event spaces for individuals and businesses will support Ontario’s hotel sector and help drive economic recovery.” Terry Mundell, President & CEO of the Greater Toronto Hotel Association, and Colin A. Morrison, Chair of the Ottawa Gatineau Hotel Association “We applaud the provincial government in permitting the hospitality industry to allow meetings and events on a per room or dedicated space basis. This will support many operations through this challenging pandemic period.” Tony Elenis President and CEO of the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association “The health and safety of our customers, visitors and staff remains our highest priority, and we are ready to welcome them back slowly, surely and safely. As the largest convention centre in Canada, our facility generates well over half a billion dollars in economic impact annually to the city and province. We are excited to move onward; to welcome guests into our safe facility this fall and continue with our strong calendar of events in 2021.” Lorenz Hassenstein President and CEO of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre “We are happy that the province is demonstrating its understanding of the importance of the meetings and events sector to the economy by allowing us to re-open in a manner that will allow us to host more meetings and events while ensuring everyone remains safe.” Nina Kressler President and CEO of the Shaw Centre “We are happy that the Province is evolving the meeting criteria in a responsible way; the industry is ready to host meetings in a safe manner.” A.
