Speaking to the challenges faced by businesses and commercial property owners due to COVID-19, Trudeau said the new Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program will help small businesses cover their rents for April, May, and June. The assistance is being rolled out in collaboration with the provinces and territories as rent policy is largely provinces and municipalities’ responsibility. The program will provide loans, including some forgivable loans, to commercial property owners who are then to either lower or forgo the rent for small businesses during these months, with a promise of more details to come. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said that the government is aware many small businesses are worried about paying rent, their suppliers, and their employees. He commended the landlords that are already offering their renters some grace during this difficult time. Though, some landlords have already issued eviction notices for businesses that didn't pay rent at the start of the month. The federal government is also opening up the eligibility criteria the Canada Emergency Business Account. The program, targeted at small- and medium-sized businesses, offers government-guaranteed loans of up to $40,000 to cover the costs of keeping their enterprise afloat during the COVID-19 crisis. Coronavirus newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox If the company can repay the balance of the loan by the end of 2022, up to $10,000 will be forgiven. The current eligibility requires applicants to prove that they paid between $50,000 and $1 million in payroll in 2019, leaving out some businesses on either side of these figures. Now, companies who paid between $20,000 and $1.5 million in total payroll in 2019 will be eligible to receive a loan. “This is money entrepreneurs and employers can use to cover operational costs and help with other immediate needs,” Trudeau said. To date, more than 195,000 loans have been approved through this program, the prime minister said, pegging the credit doled out so far at more than $7.5 billion. Small Business Minister Mary Ng said they will continue to address needs as they arise, until the country is on the other side of this pandemic. “It means that your favorite restaurant can keep the lights on while they switch over to delivery service. It means that small furniture store that usually relies on foot traffic to stay afloat, can continue to pay the costs about keeping their warehouse space… It means that the local bed and breakfast can maintain their property while we've had to temporarily close their doors,” Ng said. Reacting to the latest financial aid expansions, outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the constant evolution is further proof why in-person parliamentary sessions are required to get the policies right the first time. The NDP had been calling for more help for small businesses’ rent and had offered some ideas about how to do so, citing examples in other countries including France, Denmark and Australia, that have all offered some sort of relief or subsidy. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS STILL FEAR EVICTION Despite these welcome changes, small business owners are feeling the pinch and worry they could soon be evicted. Feron Bateman owns a pair of clothing stores in Victoria, B.C. She’s already been forced to close one of them, even though her lease doesn’t expire until the end of October. At about $7,500 per month, Bateman now worries she could be on the hook for the balance. ""It’s frightening to think,” she said. “Are they going to make you sell your house? Or are you going to lose your other store? What is going to happen if you couldn't fulfill lease due to COVID closure?"" Bateman is not alone. A grassroots group called “Save Small Business” says more than two thirds of its members say they can’t afford to pay the upcoming month’s rent. ""Sadly we've been hearing stories -- three, five a day -- of small businesses that are publicly announcing that they are going to close forever as a result of this,"" said Michael Smith, the group’s co-founder. The organization is calling for the federal government to waive three months of commercial rent, up to $10,000 a month. It also wants added leniency with deferred debt payments. Other small businesses are asking their landlords cut them some slack during these trying times. Maureen Khallad owns The Think Sun Preschool in Calgary and is hoping her landlord will cut her $6,000-monthly rent payment at least in half while she’s been forced to close the preschool. “We’ve got to work together,” she said. “If a landlord digs his heels in and locks the door, well then I guess that's the answer, but who's going to replace that empty space?"" 'MUST STAY THE COURSE' On Thursday, Trudeau said that while many are getting used to the new normal, as time goes on, staying at home and not seeing friends is going to get harder. “We’re going to miss our colleagues, our friends, our neighbours, and our parents even more than we do now. But we have to be disciplined. We must stay the course. We cannot let the progress we’ve made go to waste,” he said. Asked what kind of metrics will eventually inform the decision to start releasing restrictions or easing up on public health measures, Trudeau said criteria will include consideration of where Canada is on the pandemic’s curve and the number of cases across the country. Softening measures too soon would be “absolutely disastrous” if Canadians find themselves having to quarantine again, after already spending more than a month in self-isolation. At the earliest, he said, it’ll be “many weeks” from now. As of Thursday evening, there were 30,106 confirmedcases of COVID-19 in Canada. A week ago federal modelling projected that by this time there would be between 500 and 700 deaths from COVID-19, but the number has already risen to nearly double that, with 1,196 deaths to date. Trudeau said these projections were just that and they continue to evolve, but there have already been too many deaths in Canada. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said during the daily ministerial update that Canadians only have to look to the devastating scenes in hospitals in other countries to see why it is essential people continue to heed physical distancing advice and self-isolate. INTERNATIONAL AID, BORDER TALKS Ahead of his national address, the prime minister joined a call with his fellow G7 leaders. Speaking about what was discussed, Trudeau focused on emphasizing the collective need for a global response and said these nations also have a responsibility to assist more vulnerable countries. This call came fresh off of U.S. President Donald Trump’s declaration late Wednesday that he was looking to ease travel restrictions along the Canada-U.S. border, and his decision to pull funding to the World Health Organization, Trudeau focused on emphasizing the collective need for a global response and said these nations also have a responsibility to assist more vulnerable countries. Asked to speak to how other world leaders responded to the U.S. defunding of the WHO, Trudeau said only that the international health agency is “an important part” of the global fight against the novel coronavirus. Canada has defended the WHO, which the federal government has relied on for guidance and information amid the pandemic, and just earlier this week signalled that now isn’t the time to reopen the border beyond allowing essential goods and workers to cross between. The prime minister doubled down on this position on Thursday, citing the closeness and “special thought” that will be given to the Canada-U.S. travel restrictions, but there is “a significant amount of time still” to pass before they are lifted.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau used his daily address to make the commitment, after NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hitched his caucus’ support for the Liberal’s proposal for how the rest of the spring session will be structured to Ottawa vowing to pursue a more robust sick leave policy. Trudeau’s pledge to pursue more sick leave protections for workers is likely to see the government garner the NDP’s backing when it comes time to vote on the new agreement that will see regular sittings continue to be suspended until September. In their place the Liberals are proposing four special all-party committee meetings a week until mid-June and then four times over the summer. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox In an interview on CTV’s Power Play, Singh indicated that when the vote comes—expected by end-of-day Tuesday—his caucus will likely support it, noting that the proposal as it stands was also the result of NDP negotiation efforts. “It was our proposal to have days over the summer with the hybrid in-person and virtual sitting,” Singh said. “These were absent in the Conservative party’s proposal.” In order to see the motion pass, the government needs the backing of at least one other recognized party. If the motion secures enough votes, it’s possible the new model of meeting—which includes MPs joining in virtually via two large video screens inside the Chamber—could be up and running by Wednesday at the earliest. SICK LEAVE KEY TO 'RECOVERY PHASE' In making the sick leave commitment on Monday, Trudeau said that with more people returning to work over the coming weeks and months it will become even more important that employees feel they have the ability to stay home if they are sick or displaying symptoms of the novel coronavirus. “To come out of this crisis, our country needs workers… more than ever,” Trudeau said, citing a Sunday call with Singh about the issue. “Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness, or being able to pay their bills.” Singh was quick to celebrate the win, but said caucus will “keep pushing the government to make sure they deliver on this commitment and that they work with provinces to make sick leave for workers permanent going forward.” Trudeau said that “without delay” he will be discussing with premiers a way to ensure that those who need to stay home can without penalty. The prime minister also said the federal government will consider other long-term sick leave support. He said that British Columbia Premier John Horgan first brought up the issue on a call with all premiers a few weeks ago. Trudeau said the concern raised “quite rightly” by Horgan was whether come fall flu season, people would be able to stay home without economic impact should they develop COVID-19-like symptoms. The prime minister said he agreed it will be important that anyone who feels ill have the ability to not go into work and rather go get a test to limit the risk of a second wave. Even though the mechanisms to implement a sick leave program rest with the provinces, Trudeau pointed to other joint federal-provincial COVID-19 relief measures that have been agreed to as examples of how it can be done, such as the commercial rent relief program which launched Monday morning. “Today’s announcement means that frontline workers will no longer be forced to choose between their job and their health,” said Canadian Labour Congress President Hassan Yussuff in a statement, noting the cross-party co-operation that made this commitment a reality. “Right now, it is incredibly important that any worker who has been exposed to COVID-19 can self-quarantine without anxiety of lost wages.” “It is good to see Parliament focus on working Canadians during this crisis,” said Yussuff. PROPOSING 4-DAY HYBRID SITTINGS MPs spent the majority of their day Monday debating the pros and cons of the Liberal proposal, and that’s set to continue on Tuesday. Should the government’s motion on the future House meetings pass as proposed, MPs will continue to convene amid the ongoing pandemic—while keeping in mind public health precautions— under a slightly reworked model. It includes having the current special all-party committee focused on the government’s COVID-19 response meet Monday through Thursday, until June 17. Rather than an actual resumption of the full House of Commons, the committee would hold its meetings under a new hybrid model that will allow some MPs to participate in-person, while others can take part from their homes, via screens set up inside the Chamber. The future special committee meetings would allow MPs to question the government on non-COVID-19 matters, though concerns remain about representation inside the House from MPs from across the country given the propensity of technical and connectivity issues experienced to date. The plan would also see MPs attend four additional sittings over the summer— on July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before remaining adjourned until Sept. 21. As part of the motion committee work could continue virtually, taking on new studies such as the House affairs is being asked to do. There, the focus would be on diving deeper into an evaluation of how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, with the implementation of new tools like remote voting. FOCUS STILL NEEDS TO BE ON CRISIS: PM Defending the government’s approach to parliament amid the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak, Trudeau said that the focus still “needs to be on this crisis that has taken over almost every aspect of Canadians’ lives and of our economy.” Speaking to the motion on Monday, Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez made the case that the work of Parliament has continued through the pandemic, pointing to the hundreds of witnesses heard from, the dozens of committee meetings held, as well as the handful of emergency bills that have passed. He also noted that under the current special committee meeting structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters. In an interview on CTV’s Power Play, Rodriguez said the inability for MPs to vote remotely is a key sticking point in not opting to have actual House sittings. While the Bloc Quebecois have indicated they are less concerned about the fine print of the motion and more about the real impacts COVID-19 are having on Canadians, the government’s arguments haven’t appeared to satisfy the Official Opposition Conservatives. Opposed to the current meeting structure, the Conservatives have been calling for a more robust resumption of sittings that would allow for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out over the last two months while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill. During Monday’s debate, Conservative MPs accused the Liberals of using the COVID-19 crisis to “shut down” parliamentary accountability, and the point was made that many of the usual functions of the House—including advancing private members’ bills and filing order paper questions—have been on pause for more than two months now with no plan in sight to resume those aspects of House business. “The House of Commons needs to be functioning and needs to be seen to be functioning during this crisis. Contrary to what the Liberals, NDP, and the Bloc may think, this house is an essential service to the country, and we its members are essential workers,” outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said on Monday, in what may have been one of his final speeches in the House of Commons as party leader pending future emergency recalls, as his party is set to name his replacement this summer.

In April, a Statistics Canada survey indicated that 4.7 million Canadians began to work remotely as part of measures meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, while another 2.1 million Canadians were already working from home before the outbreak began. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Some tech companies, including Shopify, Google, Facebook and Twitter, have all began offering extended work-from-home options for their employees. Huda Idrees, the founder and CEO of Dot Health, an app that collects and stores the user’s health information, said her company will also adopt permanent work-from-home measures once the contract for their downtown Toronto office expires at the end of the year. “What we found is that we were quite productive working remotely,” she told CTV News. Zabeen Hirji, executive adviser for Future of Work, believes that while there are plenty of obvious benefits to working from home -- including a lack of commuting and more time with family -- traditional offices may not be going anywhere just yet. “I think there will be a need to bring people together physically and it could be that people work three days from home and two days from the office,” she said. Hirji also served as the chief human resources officer at the Royal Bank of Canada for 10 years and said some employees were still hesitant to work from home as the company began offering more options to do so. “RBC had flexible work arrangements and the option to work form home some of the time, but I was not comfortable taking advantage of it,” she said. “There was stigma attached to it.” Hirji said the employees she’s talked to also have concerns with working from home, including less productivity, lengthy virtual meetings and missing a social interaction with colleagues. “There are people that can’t work from home,” she said. “They can’t work from home because they don’t have the space (or) because they feel isolated.” That said, a reduced reliance on office spaces could be a big problem for cities. “When the rent starts to decline the leases stop renewing at the same rate then that valuation of properties may go down,” said Murtaza Haider, professor of real estate management at Ryerson University. In Toronto, the municipal government collects more than $4.5 billion annually in property taxes, nearly half of which is from companies.

Trudeau’s pledge to pursue more sick leave protections for workers is likely to see the government garner the NDP’s backing when it comes time to vote on the new agreement that will see regular sittings continue to be suspended until September. In their place the Liberals are proposing four special all-party committee meetings a week until mid-June and then four times over the summer. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox In an interview on CTV’s Power Play, Singh indicated that when the vote comes—expected by end-of-day Tuesday—his caucus will likely support it, noting that the proposal as it stands was also the result of NDP negotiation efforts. “It was our proposal to have days over the summer with the hybrid in-person and virtual sitting,” Singh said. “These were absent in the Conservative party’s proposal.” In order to see the motion pass, the government needs the backing of at least one other recognized party. If the motion secures enough votes, it’s possible the new model of meeting—which includes MPs joining in virtually via two large video screens inside the Chamber—could be up and running by Wednesday at the earliest. SICK LEAVE KEY TO 'RECOVERY PHASE' In making the sick leave commitment on Monday, Trudeau said that with more people returning to work over the coming weeks and months it will become even more important that employees feel they have the ability to stay home if they are sick or displaying symptoms of the novel coronavirus. “To come out of this crisis, our country needs workers… more than ever,” Trudeau said, citing a Sunday call with Singh about the issue. “Nobody should have to choose between taking a day off work due to illness, or being able to pay their bills.” Singh was quick to celebrate the win, but said caucus will “keep pushing the government to make sure they deliver on this commitment and that they work with provinces to make sick leave for workers permanent going forward.” Trudeau said that “without delay” he will be discussing with premiers a way to ensure that those who need to stay home can without penalty. The prime minister also said the federal government will consider other long-term sick leave support. He said that British Columbia Premier John Horgan first brought up the issue on a call with all premiers a few weeks ago. Trudeau said the concern raised “quite rightly” by Horgan was whether come fall flu season, people would be able to stay home without economic impact should they develop COVID-19-like symptoms. The prime minister said he agreed it will be important that anyone who feels ill have the ability to not go into work and rather go get a test to limit the risk of a second wave. Even though the mechanisms to implement a sick leave program rest with the provinces, Trudeau pointed to other joint federal-provincial COVID-19 relief measures that have been agreed to as examples of how it can be done, such as the commercial rent relief program which launched Monday morning. “Today’s announcement means that frontline workers will no longer be forced to choose between their job and their health,” said Canadian Labour Congress President Hassan Yussuff in a statement, noting the cross-party co-operation that made this commitment a reality. “Right now, it is incredibly important that any worker who has been exposed to COVID-19 can self-quarantine without anxiety of lost wages.” “It is good to see Parliament focus on working Canadians during this crisis,” said Yussuff. PROPOSING 4-DAY HYBRID SITTINGS MPs spent the majority of their day Monday debating the pros and cons of the Liberal proposal, and that’s set to continue on Tuesday. Should the government’s motion on the future House meetings pass as proposed, MPs will continue to convene amid the ongoing pandemic—while keeping in mind public health precautions— under a slightly reworked model. It includes having the current special all-party committee focused on the government’s COVID-19 response meet Monday through Thursday, until June 17. Rather than an actual resumption of the full House of Commons, the committee would hold its meetings under a new hybrid model that will allow some MPs to participate in-person, while others can take part from their homes, via screens set up inside the Chamber. The future special committee meetings would allow MPs to question the government on non-COVID-19 matters, though concerns remain about representation inside the House from MPs from across the country given the propensity of technical and connectivity issues experienced to date. The plan would also see MPs attend four additional sittings over the summer— on July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before remaining adjourned until Sept. 21. As part of the motion committee work could continue virtually, taking on new studies such as the House affairs is being asked to do. There, the focus would be on diving deeper into an evaluation of how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, with the implementation of new tools like remote voting. FOCUS STILL NEEDS TO BE ON CRISIS: PM Defending the government’s approach to parliament amid the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak, Trudeau said that the focus still “needs to be on this crisis that has taken over almost every aspect of Canadians’ lives and of our economy.” Speaking to the motion on Monday, Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez made the case that the work of Parliament has continued through the pandemic, pointing to the hundreds of witnesses heard from, the dozens of committee meetings held, as well as the handful of emergency bills that have passed. He also noted that under the current special committee meeting structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters. In an interview on CTV’s Power Play, Rodriguez said the inability for MPs to vote remotely is a key sticking point in not opting to have actual House sittings. While the Bloc Quebecois have indicated they are less concerned about the fine print of the motion and more about the real impacts COVID-19 are having on Canadians, the government’s arguments haven’t appeared to satisfy the Official Opposition Conservatives. Opposed to the current meeting structure, the Conservatives have been calling for a more robust resumption of sittings that would allow for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out over the last two months while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill. During Monday’s debate, Conservative MPs accused the Liberals of using the COVID-19 crisis to “shut down” parliamentary accountability, and the point was made that many of the usual functions of the House—including advancing private members’ bills and filing order paper questions—have been on pause for more than two months now with no plan in sight to resume those aspects of House business. “The House of Commons needs to be functioning and needs to be seen to be functioning during this crisis. Contrary to what the Liberals, NDP, and the Bloc may think, this house is an essential service to the country, and we its members are essential workers,” outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said on Monday, in what may have been one of his final speeches in the House of Commons as party leader pending future emergency recalls, as his party is set to name his replacement this summer.

In April, a Statistics Canada survey indicated that 4.7 million Canadians began to work remotely as part of measures meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, while another 2.1 million Canadians were already working from home before the outbreak began. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Some tech companies, including Shopify, Google, Facebook and Twitter, have all began offering extended work-from-home options for their employees. Huda Idrees, the founder and CEO of Dot Health, an app that collects and stores the user’s health information, said her company will also adopt permanent work-from-home measures once the contract for their downtown Toronto office expires at the end of the year. “What we found is that we were quite productive working remotely,” she told CTV News. Zabeen Hirji, executive adviser for Future of Work, believes that while there are plenty of obvious benefits to working from home -- including a lack of commuting and more time with family -- traditional offices may not be going anywhere just yet. “I think there will be a need to bring people together physically and it could be that people work three days from home and two days from the office,” she said. Hirji also served as the chief human resources officer at the Royal Bank of Canada for 10 years and said some employees were still hesitant to work from home as the company began offering more options to do so. “RBC had flexible work arrangements and the option to work form home some of the time, but I was not comfortable taking advantage of it,” she said. “There was stigma attached to it.” Hirji said the employees she’s talked to also have concerns with working from home, including less productivity, lengthy virtual meetings and missing a social interaction with colleagues. “There are people that can’t work from home,” she said. “They can’t work from home because they don’t have the space (or) because they feel isolated.” That said, a reduced reliance on office spaces could be a big problem for cities. “When the rent starts to decline the leases stop renewing at the same rate then that valuation of properties may go down,” said Murtaza Haider, professor of real estate management at Ryerson University. In Toronto, the municipal government collects more than $4.5 billion annually in property taxes, nearly half of which is from companies.

According to new short-term federal modelling released by Health Canada, as of June 15 —more than three months since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic— the country could see between 97,990 and 107,454 cases, and between 7,700 and 9,400 deaths. As of 11:15 a.m. ET, based on CTV News’ figures, there were 93,700 confirmed cases, of which 34,620 were still considered active. Across Canada 7,635 people have died to date. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Broadly speaking, the rise in infections has slowed across all age groups and in most regions of the country, however as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cautioned in his address ahead of the new data’s release: “the pandemic is still threatening the health and safety of Canadians.” Setting up the new figures, Trudeau said the situation remains “serious” in some regions where large numbers of new cases are still being reported, as well as in places like long-term care homes across Canada. As well, over the past 14 days, Quebec and Ontario have accounted for more than 90 per cent of the national case count. The updated national projections on the severity and scope of COVID-19 in Canada show that 82 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths are linked to seniors’ homes, and that outbreaks in other congregate living and work settings are also driving case counts, such as those in meat packing plants, shelters, and correctional facilities. Health Canada data shows that more than 8,700 people have been hospitalized, and of those more than 1,700 have been admitted to an intensive care unit over the course of the disease’s spread across Canada. Approximately 94 per cent of deaths have occurred in people over the age of 60. COULD SEE 'EXPLOSIVE' SECOND SPIKE Tam said that even though progress is being made in fighting the novel coronavirus, until an effective vaccine or treatment is available, an ongoing effort is going to be required or Canada could see an “explosive” second spike. Federal modelling showed that if population-based measures are loosened – allowing larger gathering sizes, permitting students to go back to school, and allowing businesses to reopen without accompanying public health measures, for example -- it “will likely cause the epidemic to rebound.” The figures showed that if the spread prevention measures are insufficient, Canada could have another peak come October. “While we start loosening some restrictions, we also have to strengthen other measures… And as people head back to work, it’s even more important that we keep a 2-metre distance from others, wash our hands, and wear a mask when physical distancing is not always possible,” Trudeau said on Thursday. The other key measures to continue will be case detection and isolation, contact-tracing and quarantining those who have come into contact with a confirmed case, and managing the risk of importing the disease from abroad. Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters that in addition to provincial reopening plans, every local public health unit will have to balance their capacity to manage a local outbreak and their regions’ level of public health precautions. She also said every community needs to have a solid understanding of what could drive transmission in their area, such as a mining camp, as is the case in her riding and which led to clusters of infections in a nearby Indigenous community. “It doesn't take very long for an outbreak to really gain some steam,” Hajdu said. “Because for some of those smaller hospitals… a surge could be very difficult to manage."" THIRD UPDATE ON MODELLING Thursday’s figures are the third federal modelling update, and they come more than a month after the last round of modelling released by Health Canada showed that the curve was flattening in Canada and that the rate of case spread had levelled off in most provinces. The first round of projections showed the peak of cases in Canada might come in late spring, with the end of the first wave in the summer. On April 9, it was estimated that between 4,000 and 300,000 people in Canada could die from COVID-19 during the pandemic depending on the level of containment efforts. Under the public health measures in place, however, officials said it was more likely that the number of deaths would be somewhere between 11,000 and 22,000. Then on April 28 the government offered more short-term projections that estimated that by May 5 Canada was on track to hit between 53,196 and 66,835 cases of COVID-19, and between 3,277 and 3,883 deaths. In reality, as of May 5 there were 62,046 confirmed cases and 4,043 people had died.

PROPOSING 4-DAY HYBRID SITTINGS MPs spent the majority of their day Monday debating the pros and cons of the Liberal proposal, and that’s set to continue on Tuesday. Should the government’s motion on the future House meetings pass as proposed, MPs will continue to convene amid the ongoing pandemic—while keeping in mind public health precautions— under a slightly reworked model. It includes having the current special all-party committee focused on the government’s COVID-19 response meet Monday through Thursday, until June 17. Rather than an actual resumption of the full House of Commons, the committee would hold its meetings under a new hybrid model that will allow some MPs to participate in-person, while others can take part from their homes, via screens set up inside the Chamber. The future special committee meetings would allow MPs to question the government on non-COVID-19 matters, though concerns remain about representation inside the House from MPs from across the country given the propensity of technical and connectivity issues experienced to date. The plan would also see MPs attend four additional sittings over the summer— on July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before remaining adjourned until Sept. 21. As part of the motion committee work could continue virtually, taking on new studies such as the House affairs is being asked to do. There, the focus would be on diving deeper into an evaluation of how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, with the implementation of new tools like remote voting. FOCUS STILL NEEDS TO BE ON CRISIS: PM Defending the government’s approach to parliament amid the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak, Trudeau said that the focus still “needs to be on this crisis that has taken over almost every aspect of Canadians’ lives and of our economy.” Speaking to the motion on Monday, Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez made the case that the work of Parliament has continued through the pandemic, pointing to the hundreds of witnesses heard from, the dozens of committee meetings held, as well as the handful of emergency bills that have passed. He also noted that under the current special committee meeting structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters. In an interview on CTV’s Power Play, Rodriguez said the inability for MPs to vote remotely is a key sticking point in not opting to have actual House sittings. While the Bloc Quebecois have indicated they are less concerned about the fine print of the motion and more about the real impacts COVID-19 are having on Canadians, the government’s arguments haven’t appeared to satisfy the Official Opposition Conservatives. Opposed to the current meeting structure, the Conservatives have been calling for a more robust resumption of sittings that would allow for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out over the last two months while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill. During Monday’s debate, Conservative MPs accused the Liberals of using the COVID-19 crisis to “shut down” parliamentary accountability, and the point was made that many of the usual functions of the House—including advancing private members’ bills and filing order paper questions—have been on pause for more than two months now with no plan in sight to resume those aspects of House business. “The House of Commons needs to be functioning and needs to be seen to be functioning during this crisis. Contrary to what the Liberals, NDP, and the Bloc may think, this house is an essential service to the country, and we its members are essential workers,” outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said on Monday, in what may have been one of his final speeches in the House of Commons as party leader pending future emergency recalls, as his party is set to name his replacement this summer.

However, provincial labour authorities say the majority of those claims have been denied because inspectors found no danger to the health, safety or physical well-being of the workers. Ontario have seen the largest spike in work refusal claims with 278 COVID-19 related refusals from March to June, according to provincial numbers. The provincial Ministry of Labour denied 277 of those claims. ""For workers to initiate a formal work refusal, the danger must be based on current conditions they’re exposed to. When the requirements for a work refusal are not met, the issue will be treated as a complaint,"" Ontario Ministry of Labour spokesperson Janet Deline said in an email. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox While employment lawyer Stephen Wolpert said many of these work refusals may be legitimate, he told CTVNews.ca that the employee's concerns may be out of fear for the virus, even if that fear isn’t necessarily a reality in their workplace. ""One of the challenges is that employees are operating on their own subjective fears that aren't always supported by science. In other words, they perceive a risk, but the risk isn't necessarily there… Sometimes employees have real concerns but those concerns aren't necessarily borne out by the science,"" Wolpert said in a phone interview from Toronto on Monday. Wolpert, who is a partner at Canadian law firm Whitten & Lublin, said Canada’s current labour laws were not designed to deal with a global health crisis. ""If you are a ministry inspector and you walk into a workplace and you see a machine that doesn't have a guard on it, that's easy to identify and [understand that] if somebody gets too close, they're going to cut themselves. But when you walk into a workplace and it's just a few people milling around, there's nothing obvious or specific that you can necessarily point to that's going to say, 'there is the problem that needs to be fixed',"" Wolpert explained. WHY A WORK REFUSAL CLAIM MAY BE FILED Wolpert said some employees may file work refusal claims amid the pandemic if they are concerned about possible exposure to COVID-19 at the workplace, a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), a lack of physical distancing, or inadequate sanitization at the business. After Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador saw the next highest number of work refusal claims at 27, followed by Quebec with 24 refusals. Newfoundland and Labrador’s claims were all in the health care industry and investigations found that there was no real danger to the workers as detailed in the claims. ""The investigations are complete and decisions have been communicated to all parties. The decisions supported the measures taken by the employer, which were considered reasonable in all cases,"" according to a statement from the province's Occupational Health and Safety Division of Service. Of Quebec's 24 work refusal claims, only one case was the subject of a decision confirming that the danger was justified. The inspector's analysis found that there was no risk to employees' safety with the other claims. Stuart Rudner, employment lawyer and founder of Rudner Law in Toronto, told CTVNews.ca that employers are required to provide a safe work environment, which means that an employee has grounds to complain if no attempts at implementing physical distancing and cleaning procedures have been made. ""If somebody feels that their workplace is unsafe, they would first go to the employer and then explain what their concerns are. The employer has a duty to look into it and make any changes that are necessary but if the employee is still unsatisfied that is when they go to the [province's] Ministry of Labour,"" Rudner said in a phone interview from Toronto on Monday. ""Then Ministry of Labour would assign an inspector to look at the specific workplace and see if it's unsafe."" However, Rudner said Canadians are required to return to work even if they don’t think it is safe yet to do so. ""There seems to be this general perception out there that work all of a sudden become optional. And I know that we're in very strange circumstances and a lot of people have been home for a while, but the reality is if you're recalled to work its not a choice you have, you're expected to return,"" Rudner said. Rudner explained that workers are only allowed to not return to work if they qualify for a statutory leave of absence for reasons such as child-care obligations or medical conditions, if they have a right to accommodation under human rights, or if the workplace is deemed unsafe by provincial authorities. The employee does not get to decide whether the workplace is safe, Rudner added. ""It is no different with COVID-19 times than it is any other time -- there's always been a right to refuse unsafe work,"" Rudner said. ""But unless you fall within one of those exceptions, there is no right to refuse to work just because you prefer not to or you generally feel unsafe going out into public."" The remainder of Canada's work refusal data is as follows: Alberta has seen 18 work refusal claims since the pandemic began, all of which were denied. In Saskatchewan, all 10 of its refusals were resolved without the involvement of the Ministry of Labour Relations. Manitoba has had nine work refusal claims with one resulting in an improvement order being issued. New Brunswick has reported 12 work refusal claims since March with one claim requiring an improvement order. Nova Scotia has had 10 work refusal claims, three of which required involvement from the Department of Labour with one still being investigated. Prince Edward Island has seen no work refusal claims since the pandemic began. British Columbia did not provide CTVNews.ca with provincial data on work refusal claims at the time of publishing. WHAT TO DO IF A WORK REFUSAL CLAIM IS DENIED For those employees who have had their work refusal claim denied but still don’t feel safe returning to work, Rudner said they have little recourse. ""There really isn't much they can do. There are some appeal rights or you can request a reconsideration although frankly it's pretty rare,"" Rudner said, adding that he has been encouraging his clients to talk to their employers to see if there are alternative solutions both parties can agree on. ""Go to the employer and say 'Look, I'm not comfortable going to work right now, will you allow me to stay on leave of absence?' and many employers are willing to because they don't need 100 per cent of the workforce right now,"" Rudner said. ""But that's purely voluntary on the part of the employer."" Wolpert said if no solution can be reached and the employer insists that the individual returns to work, the employee has little choice in the matter. ""If you're still not satisfied that it's safe, you're left with a really lousy choice: either you go into a workplace that you feel is unsafe or you stop working and risk having somebody tell you you've abandoned your job,"" Wolpert said. Despite the pressure to return to work, Rudner said employees should still file a work complaint if there is a real risk of danger. But if it is ""more of a general concern about going into public,"" Rudner suggests employees ask their employer if they can continue working from home or request a short-term leave of absence. Rudner said if those options don't work, the employees must do their best to ensure their own safety. ""You're going to have to go to work but just make sure that you take as many precautions as you possibly can, and if you do see if there is an unsafe condition at work that's when you should be reporting it,"" he said.

The new poll conducted by Nanos Research for CTV News surveyed 1,049 Canadians within the past week, and found that two-thirds of respondents support, or somewhat support, another round of business closures in the event of a significant rise in cases and hospitalizations. Forty-two per cent of respondents said they support the closures, while another 28 per cent said they somewhat support them. About one in four Canadians oppose (16 per cent) or somewhat oppose (11 per cent) the idea. Support for shutting down businesses during a second wave was strongest in Ontario (53 per cent) and weakest in Quebec (24 per cent). Those older than 55 -- who are more susceptible to the virus -- were more supportive of the closures, at 77 per cent, than younger Canadians aged 18 to 34, at 64 per cent support. Businesses were hit hard in March when the pandemic forced many to shutter, leaving millions of Canadians without jobs. To offset lost wages, the federal government has doled out monthly payments of $2,000 to more than 8 million Canadians without work through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) since April. As of July 3, more than $53.5 billion had been paid out. In mid-June the federal government extended CERB by eight weeks, offering more time for workers looking for a job. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government is looking for ways to incentivize returning to work rather than staying home and remaining on the program. In recent months, business has slowly returned to normal as provinces expand their lists of which businesses are allowed to reopen. 4-IN-5 SUPPORT MANDATORY MASKS The poll also found that most Canadians support the mandatory wearing of masks in all public spaces, with 54 per cent in support and 25 per cent somewhat supportive. Nearly one in five respondents said they opposed (11 per cent) or somewhat opposed (nine per cent) mandatory face masks. Support for mandatory face masks was highest in Ontario, at 65 per cent. While Ontario Premier Doug Ford has repeatedly rejected this idea, Toronto -- which accounts for 12 per cent of Canada’s total caseload -- recently made it mandatory to wear a face mask in all enclosed public spaces, such as grocery stores and public transit. Ottawa’s mayor said he’d be open to a similar rule, if it’s supported by the city’s top doctor. Support for mandatory masks in public was lowest in the Prairies, which still saw a majority of support at 68 per cent. A group of Canadian doctors and scientists have been pushing for masks to be mandatory in all public spaces, saying the step is a simple and effective way to quash the outbreak. Many public transit authorities already recommend or require that passengers wear masks, including in Vancouver, Ottawa, Hamilton and Guelph. CANADIANS EXPECT A SECOND WAVE The number of daily cases of COVID-19 has been steadily trending downward for months. For example, the country reported 286 new cases of COVID-19 on June 30, a sizeable drop from 772 new cases May 30. But epidemiologists have been warning for months that, based on what is known about how coronaviruses spread, a second wave of cases is likely in the winter or fall. This message appears to resone among Canadians. According to the Nanos poll, nearly nine in 10 Canadians say a second wave of COVID-19 infections in the next six months is likely (57 per cent) or somewhat likely (32 per cent). Just five per cent say it’s not likely, with three per cent saying it’s somewhat not likely. METHODOLOGY Nanos conducted an RDD dual frame (land- and cell-lines) hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,049 Canadians, 18 years of age or older, between June 28th and July 2nd, 2020 as part of an omnibus survey. Participants were randomly recruited by telephone using live agents and administered a survey online. The sample included both land- and cell-lines across Canada. The results were statistically checked and weighted by age and gender using the latest Census information and the sample is geographically stratified to be representative of Canada. Individuals randomly called using random digit dialling with a maximum of five call backs. The margin of error for this survey is ±3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. This study was commissioned by CTV News and the research was conducted by Nanos Research.

The central bank's business outlook survey suggested about half of firms foresee a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions. The survey report published Monday suggests many service-sector and energy companies don't expect a return to pre-pandemic employment levels. The worry among workers about losing their jobs rose to the highest level seen in the bank's regular survey of consumer expectations, released alongside the business outlook report. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Workers' expectations of how easily they could find new work dropped to the lowest level in the survey since the 2015 oil-price shock as the country faces a different and far deeper economic crisis. Lockdowns and stay-at-home requests from governments put the economy in a deep freeze in mid-March, with the thaw beginning in recent weeks as restrictions began to be rolled back. Nearly half of all businesses reported an outright decline of their sales in the past 12 months because of COVID-19, low energy prices and the uncertainty both wrought. More than half of businesses expect their total sales over the next 12 months to be lower than they were in the last year, with future sales indicators at record lows. About half of firms expect their sales will ""mostly recover"" within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions. Some companies said they could get back to normal operations within a month of public health restrictions being lifted. ""Overall, while the economy is on the mend, it's still early days and both businesses and consumers will continue to grapple with uncertainty over the foreseeable future,"" TD economist Ksenia Bushmeneva said in a note. ""This will manifest in lower spending by households and weak investment plans by businesses, both of which will weigh on the pace of economic recovery."" Consumers' expectations for wage growth were below what they anticipated for inflation, while the outlook for growth in household income dropped to its lowest level in the survey's history. The consumer survey said spending expectations have tumbled, which the bank says suggests consumers have become more cautious due to the economic impact and health risks related to the pandemic. The bank said consumers expect to spend mostly on essentials and less on durable goods like cars and furniture, as well services that involve face-to-face interactions like eating out, travel or going to the movies. A Royal Bank report Monday estimated the drop in economic output and sharp rise in spending could put the federal deficit at $265 billion this fiscal year. The report said deficits could be close to double those the Liberals predicted just over six months ago as revenues drop -- not including an expected need to spend more to help the economy recover. ""If they needed to extend some of the (aid) programs to ensure that the economy wasn't going to be ... more meaningfully impacted, they're in the fiscal position to do so,"" said RBC economist Colin Guldimann, who co-wrote the report. ""Of course, there is a position when some spending becomes too much spending and it's really hard to know where that is."" Federal spending on fighting the pandemic and its effects, by the government's most recent figures, amounts to about $174 billion. About one-third of service and energy companies told the Bank of Canada they have tapped a federal wage subsidy to reduce or avoid layoffs. Other firms looking to rehire or hire new staff cited an emergency federal benefit for workers as a hurdle to their plans. The latest figures from the federal government show the $45-billion wage subsidy program has paid nearly $17.1 billion to 245,160 companies as of June 29. Meanwhile, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, has paid $53.53 billion in benefits to 8.16 million people as of June 28, since it was introduced in late March. David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, argued in a research note Monday that the Liberals shouldn't make deep cuts to their aid measures. He calculated that households will have a surplus in their budgets by $202.9 billion due to Ottawa's deficit spending, while corporations would see a surplus to the tune of $37.1 billion. ""As federal deficits can create surpluses in other areas, the opposite is also true,"" Macdonald wrote. ""Federal surpluses, through cutbacks and austerity, must force another sector into deficit by the same amount."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 6, 2020.

And that was enough to essentially shut down the world's longest international border for visitors. When the U.S. and Canada mutually agreed in March to shut down the border to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, no one predicted it would be closed this long. There is still no specified date for its reopening, although trade has continued between the countries. ""There's a closeness that we're definitely missing, but I can tell you not anyone that I have spoken to here wants that border opened anytime soon. We miss you citizens of the U.S., but we're not comfortable opening the border,"" Bernadette Clement, the mayor of Cornwall, Ontario, said in an interview with CNN. East to west for thousands of kilometres, in communities on both sides of the national divide, the border closure is redefining not just economic relationships, but personal lives, in ways no one expected. ""This really is going to have a long-term impact on our communities, economically, socially and on all the things that are really important to us,"" said Tim Currier, the mayor of Massena, New York, a ""sister"" community to Cornwall, just several kilometres across the border on the other side of the St. Lawrence River. No longer. The border is shut tight for any trips that are deemed ""non-essential"" or discretionary and that includes all recreation and tourism. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox BIGGER PAIN ON CANADIAN SIDE OF BORDER Statistics Canada recently reported that cross border car trips are down about 95% across both sides of the border. For decades in these border communities, people have crossed the border in both directions every day to attend a school or training program, go on a shopping trip to grab a bargain, indulge a craving for a meal at a favourite restaurant or a last-minute trip to the casino to play the slot machines. In a way, the border closure has been a victim of its own success. Essential goods and services have continued to flow across the border efficiently and easily with supply chains largely unaffected. Canada and the U.S. maintain one of largest trading relationships in the world, doing about $1.9 billion in trade every day. While the rules apply equally in both countries, the economic pain has not been distributed evenly on the Cornwall-Massena divide. ""There is no question about the economic impact. We have small businesses that have not reopened, we have some that will never reopen because they rely heavily on Canadian traffic,"" Mayor Currier said in a phone interview with CNN. Mayor Clement says Cornwall is feeling the economic loss of American clientele but with a larger, more dynamic economy, the damage hasn't been as acute. And as infection rates climbed in the U.S., diverging from Canada's flattened pandemic curve, just seeing cars with U.S. plates alarmed many Canadians. ""It has been challenging to keep everybody calm because residents took note of those plates, yes,"" Clement said. Whether in Cornwall's Walmart parking lot or in its downtown business district, many locals told CNN they preferred the border stay closed for months to come given the higher infection rate in the U.S. A July poll by Ipsos showed more than eight in 10 Canadians want the border to remain closed until at least the end of the year. MOHAWK COUNCIL OF AKWESASNE: STRADDLING THE BORDER ""The challenge for us being right on the border is we see the surge in cases in the United States as a whole. Some states have more cases than the entire country of Canada. We have to be cautious about that,"" Grand Chief Abram Benedict of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne said in a phone interview with CNN. The Mohawk of Akwesasne straddles the U.S. and Canadian borders and its 13,000 residents hold a unique position. They've maintained their right to travel between the two countries even during this pandemic. When presenting their identification cards to prove Indian status, they can cross the border for essential travel in either the U.S. or Canada to shop, bank, go to a doctor or check on family members. It also means they are exempt from a two-week quarantine when entering Canada. Benedict says that means those with New York state licence plates are often seen in and around Cornwall. Most Canadians residents now understand they have a right to be there, but Benedict says his community has a greater responsibility to keep everyone safe. An overnight curfew in Akwesasne is still in place with a ban on travel outside an 80-kilometre (50-mile) radius. Benedict adds that many in his community have been wearing masks long before it was mandatory in Cornwall. In fact, new infections are low on both sides of the border, but the longer the border stays closed, the more profound the economic impact. ""I've got to make up for a 40% hole in my business,"" said Todd Papineau, general manager of the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort, in a phone interview with CNN, saying he doesn't expect Canadians to be back from months. Papineau says most of his 750 staff have been off work for about five months now, although he is trying to bring back about half of them for a proposed reopening later this month relying on local U.S. customers only. ""The worst-case scenario is this will still be with us this time next year, that's what I believe; I hope I'm wrong,"" Papineau said. 'IT'S HARDER FOR BUSINESSES' At Philos Restaurant in Cornwall, U.S. customers were a staple for the family-owned Greek restaurant and pizzeria. After five months, the restaurant just reopened to dine-in customers. On a recent Friday afternoon, only one table was being served in a dining hall that can serve more than 100 customers. The extended border closure has meant that businesses that rely on U.S. customers are coming to grips with a decline in business for months to come. ""It is harder for businesses. We have fewer customers, and it's a big change for people working in those businesses because they don't know what to expect in the future,"" said Nancy Page, a manager who's been working at the restaurant for most of its two decades. Some border communities, especially in the U.S., are lobbying for a path forward to try to get the border open using what they call a careful, slow, thoughtful process, taking advice from public health experts. ""I certainly respect Canada's view, but what's happening in Florida is not happening in New York and New Yorkers are taking significant steps to reduce the likelihood and the chances of infection cases increasing,"" Currier said. Many in Canada's business community agree with him, arguing Canada should double down on rapid testing and that a two-week quarantine for months to come is unsustainable and will disproportionately impact leisure and hospitality. ""Some sectors have been pummeled and their very existence is at stake,"" says Goldy Hyder, president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada adding, ""I do think there needs to be a plan to work towards a reopening in a responsible way.""

The deals hinge on Health Canada approval but if trials proceed as planned, deliveries in Canada would begin at the start of 2021. The government has also inked deals with pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna for access to millions of doses of their unique candidates. ""Taken together, our vaccine agreements with Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson, will give Canada at least 88 million doses, with options to obtain tens of millions more,"" said Trudeau during a press conference on Monday. ""Once a vaccine is proven to work, we’ll also need to be able to produce and distribute it here at home."" To date, Novavax will supply 76 million doses of NVX-CoV2373, Moderna will supply 56 million of mRNA-1273, Johnson & Johnson will supply 38 million of Ad26.COV2.S, and Pfizer will supply 20 million BNT162. Trudeau also announced the government would be spending $126 million to expand the bio-manufacturing facility at the National Research Council in Montreal, with a projected deadline of mid-2021. ""This funding will increase this facility’s ability to manufacture vaccines and will strengthen the NRC’s partnerships with vaccine developers."" Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch says the candidate still has a variety of regulatory hurdles to overcome before it gets the green light but this step indicates Canada is well positioned in the global race to find a COVID-19 vaccine. ""It’s wonderful to see that the federal government is looking at vaccine candidates, looking at which ones could be successful. We appreciate that some of these might not be successful and we’re sort of hedging our bets and we’ll have access to vaccines when they become available,"" he told CTV News Channel on Monday. This follows news last week that Chinese customs halted the shipment of CanSino Biologics’ vaccine candidate to Canada, denying the opportunity to commence human trials here. ""Due to the delay in the shipment of the vaccine doses to Canada it is evident this specific opportunity is over and the NRC is focusing its team and facilities on other partners and COVID-19 priorities,"" the National Research Council said in a statement on Thursday. Trudeau responded to the move on Monday, saying he had hoped the long-standing partnership between the Canadian government and CanSino would have proved fruitful amid COVID-19 after successfully partnering with the company to combat the Ebola virus. ""Unfortunately China didn’t grant export permits for the vaccine to Canada so we’re continuing to focus on the many other paths that are very promising,"" he said. While multiple trials testing various vaccine candidates are progressing around the world, there is currently no accepted cure or vaccine for the novel coronavirus. In a follow-up press conference on Monday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said COVID-19 immunization will not be mandatory but Canadians can be assured that Health Canada’s regulatory process will yield a safe vaccine. ""We want to be very clear, Health Canada will not authorize a vaccine unless scientific evidence demonstrates that it is safe and effective,"" she said. ""Even in this accelerated environment, health-care officials are working around the clock to ensure Canada is well prepared when a safe vaccine becomes available."" She praised Canadians for having a high degree of vaccine literacy when compared internationally, but warned of misinformation online. ""It’s so important that Canadians use credible sources when they’re looking for information about this vaccine and any other,"" she said. ""Including your family doctor, local public health units, or by visiting Health Canada’s website."" VACCINE STRATEGY Asked about which countries will get access to what and when, Minister of Procurement Anita Anand said the government’s strategy to diversify suppliers will place Canada at the ""front of the line."" ""At this stage, no one knows which vaccine is going to be successful. Therefore, we need to have many options on the table for Canadians and I will assure you that we aren’t on a frolic of our own in this decision-making."" While Canada won’t have hands on the production of these vaccine candidates, Anand said investments like that in the NRC will help bolster the country’s abilities in the longer term. ""We need to make sure just as we did with PPE that there is a Canadian answer here.""

Canada has emerged from lockdown and returned to at least a semblance of normalcy that will soon include a large-scale return to school of elementary and secondary students. The curve of the country’s total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has flattened, now reaching more than 126,000 as of Aug. 27, but questions remain about how and how quickly the virus spreads, who’s at risk, how people can protect themselves and how transmission can be managed going forward. Complete coverage at CTVNews.ca/Coronavirus Coronavirus newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox To sort through some of the noise, CTVNews.ca asked several doctors to address some of the most frequently asked questions about the ongoing pandemic. Can you contract COVID-19 more than once? Scientists at the University of Hong Kong said on Aug. 24 that they have the first evidence of someone being reinfected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Genetic tests revealed that a 33-year-old man returning to Hong Kong from a trip to Spain in mid-August had a different strain of the coronavirus than the one he'd previously been infected with in March, said Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, the microbiologist who led the work. The man had mild symptoms the first time and none the second time. His more recent infection was detected through screening and testing at the Hong Kong airport. Kai-Wang To said the man’s case shows that some people don’t have “lifelong immunity” to the virus after having it once. The paper has been accepted by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases but not yet published, and some independent experts urged caution until full results are available. Whether people who have had COVID-19 are immune to new infections and for how long are key questions that have implications for vaccine development and decisions about returning to work, school and social activities. Even if someone can be infected a second time, it's not known if they have some protection against serious illness, because the immune system generally remembers how to make antibodies against a virus it's seen before. Early on in the pandemic, there were media reports in China, Japan, and South Korea about individuals who had the virus and eventually tested negative for it and were released, only to test positive for it again a short time later. Scientists in those countries have speculated that testing errors could be to blame. Dr. Iris Gorfinkel, a Toronto family physician and medical researcher, told CTV’s Your Morning on March 16 that’s it’s difficult to pin down immunity because viruses tend to morph. “So just like any other virus, there’s the possibility that it could shift or drift. Just minor changes could change it from a once mild infection to a more severe infection,” she explained. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said it’s “quite possible” for individuals who had COVID-19 to become infected again. “One of the concerns we have is there may be a second wave of infection if our strategies for containment and for infection control are not good enough, and that's why it's really important for everybody to adopt a very consistent attitude and philosophy that we're in this for the long haul,” he told CTV’s Chief News Anchor and Senior Editor Lisa LaFlamme. On April 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) told multiple media outlets they were investigating reports of recovered COVID-19 patients testing positive for the illness again after they initially tested negative. However, the WHO said they still need more epidemiological data to draw any conclusions about the virus’ “shedding profile.” Is a second wave of infections coming? Britain, Germany, France, South Korea and Rwanda are among the countries tightening up pandemic restrictions in the face of rising numbers. In Europe, the increase in cases is being blamed on summer travel and gatherings of friends and family. COVID-19 has killed more than 826,000 people worldwide since surfacing in China late last year and more than 24 million infections have been recorded. But health authorities around the world have repeatedly warned that this pandemic could come in waves, just as the Spanish flu in 1918-1920 did. The outbreak began in March of 1918 and a second wave, far deadlier than the first, hit in the fall of 1918. The pandemic then subsided for almost a year and resurged again in the fall and winter of 1919. Many public health experts warn that with a return to indoor living as the cool weather of the fall descends, a spike in cases is very likely. There is also the threat of trying to manage COVID-19 cases during the traditional flu season, a twin-epidemic spectre that health experts warn could overwhelm health-care systems. But the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere is cause for some optimism. Countries there, including South Africa, Australia and Argentina, saw lower-than-normal flu numbers. In some areas, there was virtually no flu at all. It’s believed that masking, physical distancing, better hand hygiene, and crowd avoidance helped to minimize the spread of both the flu and COVID-19. ""This could be one of the worst seasons we've had from a public health perspective with COVID and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we've had,"" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press on Aug. 26. Getting the flu shot will provide no protection against COVID-19, says Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist in Toronto, but regular vaccinations are still important for optimizing health. “We should be up to date on all our routine vaccinations, our pneumonia vaccines, our flu vaccines, our regular vaccines, so that we can ensure that our health is optimized in case we come down with an infection,” he said. That’s important in warding off the scenario of having both COVID-19 and a strain of the flu or another virus simultaneously. “It’s totally possible to have what’s called a co-infection and we know people who have multiple infections at the same time can have a worse outcome,” Bogoch said. How far away is a vaccine? Some pharmaceutical giants have said a vaccine could be on the 2020 horizon, but other experts say it may be unrealistic to even expect one in 2021. What is clear is that there are hundreds of potential vaccines in development – some already in human clinical trials – and governments around the world have invested billions in vaccine research. Check out CTVNews.ca’s vaccine tracker to learn more. And while the world awaits a vaccine, there are continuing advances in treatments, surveillance, and testing that experts say will help mitigate the spread and effects of the virus. How do you know if you have a cold, the flu, or COVID-19? Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have few to no symptoms, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). If symptoms are present, they can easily be mistaken for a common cold or the flu because of their similarities. According to the health agency, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever (38 C and above), new or worsening cough, difficulty breathing, chills, fatigue or weakness, muscle or body aches, headache and gastrointestinal issues, including vomiting, diarrhea and pain. Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes, says the PHAC. The World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Less common symptoms, it says, include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis (pink eye), sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. Gorfinkel said clinicians can’t distinguish between the illnesses based on symptoms alone. She said they can all present the same way, which is why the patient’s travel history or history of exposure to the virus is so important in determining whether someone might have COVID-19. “We do not have the facilities or the tests to test absolutely everybody, so that history of travel if you’re basically otherwise well, that’s a critical part of it,” she explained. Is losing your sense of smell or taste a sign of a minor case of COVID-19? Both the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization have added the loss of sense of smell and/or taste to their lists of symptoms. There have been reports of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell and/or sense of taste, but they didn’t show any other symptoms of the disease. Because research on the topic is still in its early stages, Bogoch said those symptoms alone are not enough to indicate someone has COVID-19. “We don’t have all the answers yet,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on April 16. “But we're hearing more and more people who have disturbances in taste and smell and there's even some data that's emerging that says maybe about 25 to 30 per cent of people might have that, along with some other symptoms.” Bogoch said it’s also important to remember that the loss of sense of smell and taste are common symptoms of many other upper respiratory viral infections. “It’s not specific to COVID-19, but it certainly may be a component of this infection,” he said. Who is getting tested? According to the latest data from the PHAC, as of Aug. 26, more than 5,246,341 people have been tested for COVID-19 in Canada. This corresponds to a test rate of 139,570 per one million people. Of all people tested, 2.3 per cent have been found to be positive. Canada does not have formal criteria for determining who should be tested, meaning guidelines vary from province to province. In Alberta, for instance, anyone can be tested, regardless of whether they have symptoms. Ontario and B.C., on the other hand, are only testing those with symptoms. Anyone who is showing symptoms of COVID-19 or is concerned they may have acquired the virus should contact their doctor or other primary health-care provider. Can young people fall seriously ill? While much of the attention about who is most vulnerable to COVID-19 has centred on the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, cases among young people are growing. According to the latest PHAC data, as of Aug. 26, the 20 to 29 cohort made up the largest group by percentage of total confirmed cases at 15.7 per cent. Those 80 and above were the second largest cohort at 15.2 per cent. Those 19 and under made up 8.5 per cent of total cases. The data shows 68.4 per cent of Canada’s cases were among those under the age of 60, while those under the age of 50 made up 53.7 per cent of the total. Those percentages among younger demographics have creeped up as the pandemic has gone on. As of April 15, COVID-19 patients under the age of 60 made up 65 per cent of Canada’s total cases, while those under the age of 50 made up 47 per cent of the total. Bogoch said that everyone can be infected by the novel coronavirus and there’s always a risk that some people will have a more severe infection. However, he said older people and those with underlying medical conditions still have a greater risk of a severe outcome than younger individuals. “If we take a step back and look at the 30,000-foot view and look at who is more likely to get a severe infection, it is overwhelmingly those over the age of 60 and really, over the age of 80 years old,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on March 20. As of Aug. 26, 83.5 per cent of those hospitalized for COVID-19 were over 50. Among those who have died, 89.6 per cent were over 70 years old and less than 1 per cent were under 50. Bogoch said the most important metric to look at when studying data about severe infections from this virus is death. “If you get infected, you either live or you die, it sounds morbid, but I think that’s an extremely important distinction to make and if we look at death, it is overwhelmingly in those over 60 and disproportionately high in those over the age of 80,” he said. Is it safe to gather with family and friends in small groups? Physical distancing recommendations have evolved as Canada has reopened its economy and public life. Early on, health and political leaders urged Canadians to stay home and to only venture out for essentials. They strongly advised against making physical contact with friends or family. But as the country managed to flatten the curve on new cases, many provinces implemented so-called “bubbles” to govern safe social circles in which households limit their close contact to a defined group of people. That number varies across Canada – from 10 in Ontario to 15 in Alberta, while some provinces, such as New Brunswick, advised no more than two-household bubbles. ""Physical distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak,"" PHAC says on its website. It lists social activities from least risky to most risky in this way: • Home alone or with household contacts • Outdoors with housemates or social bubble • Outdoors with physical distancing • Outdoor/indoor short amount of time • Indoors large groups long time • Indoors/outdoors crowded longer time Can the virus linger on surfaces or be transmitted through the air? While the research is still in its early stages, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that preliminary evidence suggests the new coronavirus can persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, but this might vary depending on conditions, such as the type of surface, humidity, and the environment. As for whether the virus can be transmitted through the air, the WHO states that “the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks"" instead of through the air. How long can the novel coronavirus survive on different surfaces? However, a study from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and published in the “New England Journal of Medicine” found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours. The researchers discovered this by using a device to dispense an aerosol with duplicated microscopic droplets of the virus, which would be released by a cough or sneeze. The tests showed the virus in aerosols could still infect people for at least three hours. The study also found the virus was viable, or contagious, for varying amounts of time on different surfaces. For copper it was viable for up to four hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Bogoch said the study provided doctors with helpful guidance on the matter. “This really just reinforces what we’ve been saying all along, ‘wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands,’” he told CTV’s Your Morning on March 18. If you have been in isolation because one person in your household is sick, do you have to continue to stay home for another two weeks if another person falls ill? For people living in households with multiple residents, it may be difficult to avoid infecting each other. Bogoch says that if someone becomes sick with COVID-19, the best course of action is to call the local public health authority. “It’s extremely important to call the local public health hotline to discuss the exact situation so they can give you very specific recommendations based on your unique setting,” he told CTV’s Your Morning. In general, though, it appears the answer to that question may be a 'yes.' PHAC says that anyone who has been in contact with a suspected, probably or confirmed case of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days, starting at the time of contact. This approach was taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who entered self-isolation with his family after Sophie Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for the virus. Once his wife was given the all clear, the prime minister remained in isolation until it had been two weeks since their last contact before he went out in public again. Can you contract the virus from passing people on the sidewalk? While health officials have warned people to keep two metres apart from each other at all times to avoid spreading the virus, that’s not always possible in certain circumstances, such as in a narrow hallway or on the sidewalk. Mandatory masks policies in indoor settings and advice to wear face coverings in any situation where two metres’ distance can’t be maintained are now commonplace across Canada. Bogoch said that obviously people should try to avoid being among crowds in confined places, but there is a very low risk of transmission if it happens. “The risk of transmission for that second where people are passing within a two-metre radius of each other is almost zero per cent,” he told CTV’s Your Morning on April 16. “It's extraordinarily small.” Even if one person is infected with COVID-19, Bogoch said it’s “extraordinarily unlikely” they will transmit it to someone passing them on the sidewalk. The exception, of course, is if they touch each other, he said. Should seniors and children be separated if they live in the same home? While children appear to be less affected by the virus, elderly people and those with other medical issues are more at risk of suffering a severe outcome from a COVID-19 infection. For families that have both seniors and young children living under the same roof, Bogoch said they should take care to separate them if anyone shows symptoms. However, he said that should be the case for anyone who is living with others and exhibits any symptoms, such as fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing. “You just have to be very mindful if anyone has any symptoms whatsoever they should be separated,” he said. How can caregivers protect themselves while helping someone with COVID-19 at home? For people who are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, the Public Health Agency of Canada has a number of tips on how they can protect themselves while they provide care. According to PHAC, only one healthy person should provide care to the individual with COVID-19, and that person should limit their contact with them as much as possible. They should also not share personal items with them, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. The ill person should have their own bathroom, if possible. If not, they should put the toilet lid down every time before flushing. Caregivers should wear a mask, disposable gloves, and eye protection when they’re in close proximity to the patient and never reuse the mask or gloves. They should also frequently wash their hands with soap and water, especially after contact with the sick individual. What’s more, caregivers should remain vigilant about monitoring themselves for symptoms for 14 days. Should you wipe down all of your groceries when you return from the store? While the SARS-CoV-2 virus can linger on surfaces from anywhere to a couple of hours to a few days, Bogoch said it’s not necessary to wipe down groceries after buying them at the store. “I think if people go to the grocery store, they get groceries, I think it’s just fair to put them away,” he told CTV’s Your Morning. As for fruits and vegetables, Bogoch said there is no need to take any extra precautions with those and people can simply wash them with tap water before eating them, as they normally should.

And that was enough to essentially shut down the world's longest international border for visitors. When the U.S. and Canada mutually agreed in March to shut down the border to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, no one predicted it would be closed this long. There is still no specified date for its reopening, although trade has continued between the countries. ""There's a closeness that we're definitely missing, but I can tell you not anyone that I have spoken to here wants that border opened anytime soon. We miss you citizens of the U.S., but we're not comfortable opening the border,"" Bernadette Clement, the mayor of Cornwall, Ontario, said in an interview with CNN. East to west for thousands of kilometres, in communities on both sides of the national divide, the border closure is redefining not just economic relationships, but personal lives, in ways no one expected. ""This really is going to have a long-term impact on our communities, economically, socially and on all the things that are really important to us,"" said Tim Currier, the mayor of Massena, New York, a ""sister"" community to Cornwall, just several kilometres across the border on the other side of the St. Lawrence River. No longer. The border is shut tight for any trips that are deemed ""non-essential"" or discretionary and that includes all recreation and tourism. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox BIGGER PAIN ON CANADIAN SIDE OF BORDER Statistics Canada recently reported that cross border car trips are down about 95% across both sides of the border. For decades in these border communities, people have crossed the border in both directions every day to attend a school or training program, go on a shopping trip to grab a bargain, indulge a craving for a meal at a favourite restaurant or a last-minute trip to the casino to play the slot machines. In a way, the border closure has been a victim of its own success. Essential goods and services have continued to flow across the border efficiently and easily with supply chains largely unaffected. Canada and the U.S. maintain one of largest trading relationships in the world, doing about $1.9 billion in trade every day. While the rules apply equally in both countries, the economic pain has not been distributed evenly on the Cornwall-Massena divide. ""There is no question about the economic impact. We have small businesses that have not reopened, we have some that will never reopen because they rely heavily on Canadian traffic,"" Mayor Currier said in a phone interview with CNN. Mayor Clement says Cornwall is feeling the economic loss of American clientele but with a larger, more dynamic economy, the damage hasn't been as acute. And as infection rates climbed in the U.S., diverging from Canada's flattened pandemic curve, just seeing cars with U.S. plates alarmed many Canadians. ""It has been challenging to keep everybody calm because residents took note of those plates, yes,"" Clement said. Whether in Cornwall's Walmart parking lot or in its downtown business district, many locals told CNN they preferred the border stay closed for months to come given the higher infection rate in the U.S. A July poll by Ipsos showed more than eight in 10 Canadians want the border to remain closed until at least the end of the year. MOHAWK COUNCIL OF AKWESASNE: STRADDLING THE BORDER ""The challenge for us being right on the border is we see the surge in cases in the United States as a whole. Some states have more cases than the entire country of Canada. We have to be cautious about that,"" Grand Chief Abram Benedict of the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne said in a phone interview with CNN. The Mohawk of Akwesasne straddles the U.S. and Canadian borders and its 13,000 residents hold a unique position. They've maintained their right to travel between the two countries even during this pandemic. When presenting their identification cards to prove Indian status, they can cross the border for essential travel in either the U.S. or Canada to shop, bank, go to a doctor or check on family members. It also means they are exempt from a two-week quarantine when entering Canada. Benedict says that means those with New York state licence plates are often seen in and around Cornwall. Most Canadians residents now understand they have a right to be there, but Benedict says his community has a greater responsibility to keep everyone safe. An overnight curfew in Akwesasne is still in place with a ban on travel outside an 80-kilometre (50-mile) radius. Benedict adds that many in his community have been wearing masks long before it was mandatory in Cornwall. In fact, new infections are low on both sides of the border, but the longer the border stays closed, the more profound the economic impact. ""I've got to make up for a 40% hole in my business,"" said Todd Papineau, general manager of the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort, in a phone interview with CNN, saying he doesn't expect Canadians to be back from months. Papineau says most of his 750 staff have been off work for about five months now, although he is trying to bring back about half of them for a proposed reopening later this month relying on local U.S. customers only. ""The worst-case scenario is this will still be with us this time next year, that's what I believe; I hope I'm wrong,"" Papineau said. 'IT'S HARDER FOR BUSINESSES' At Philos Restaurant in Cornwall, U.S. customers were a staple for the family-owned Greek restaurant and pizzeria. After five months, the restaurant just reopened to dine-in customers. On a recent Friday afternoon, only one table was being served in a dining hall that can serve more than 100 customers. The extended border closure has meant that businesses that rely on U.S. customers are coming to grips with a decline in business for months to come. ""It is harder for businesses. We have fewer customers, and it's a big change for people working in those businesses because they don't know what to expect in the future,"" said Nancy Page, a manager who's been working at the restaurant for most of its two decades. Some border communities, especially in the U.S., are lobbying for a path forward to try to get the border open using what they call a careful, slow, thoughtful process, taking advice from public health experts. ""I certainly respect Canada's view, but what's happening in Florida is not happening in New York and New Yorkers are taking significant steps to reduce the likelihood and the chances of infection cases increasing,"" Currier said. Many in Canada's business community agree with him, arguing Canada should double down on rapid testing and that a two-week quarantine for months to come is unsustainable and will disproportionately impact leisure and hospitality. ""Some sectors have been pummeled and their very existence is at stake,"" says Goldy Hyder, president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada adding, ""I do think there needs to be a plan to work towards a reopening in a responsible way.""

No vaccine has been approved for use in Canada. Each shot would come with its own logistical barriers. Plus, Canada must wait for shipments from vaccine-producing countries who will inoculate their own citizens first. While Health Canada could be just weeks away from approving Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccine candidates for use in Canada, whether or not one of them spells the beginning of the end and a return to normal remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the latest federal modelling data suggests the second wave of the pandemic could get worse long before a vaccine rolls out across the country. CTVNews.ca readers submitted their burning questions about COVID-19 immunization and we posed them to infectious disease experts Drs. Isaac Bogoch, Zain Chagla and Sumon Chakrabarti, and other specialists. Here’s what they said. Note: Questions have been edited and condensed for clarity. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Ask the Doctor: Need answers that aren’t found here? Email us your COVID-19 vaccine questions at dotcom@bellmedia.ca How long will it take for Health Canada to approve a vaccine and for it to start circulating? As with other aspects of the COVID-19 vaccine process, the approval process has been sped up, said Chagla. Normally, pharmaceutical companies would send completed data sets to Health Canada for approval. Now, analysis of data that would typically be under embargo at this stage is happening in “real time,” he said. U.S. health officials are expected to meet on Dec. 10 to determine emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine candidate, in which case distribution could begin on Dec. 11. Chagla doesn’t expect Canada to take much longer for the approval process, and thinks a vaccine could “start drizzling in at the end of the year.” “I don’t think Canada is going to let themselves fall that far behind, noting that hopefully most of that data or some of that data is already being fed back to Health Canada right now and it’s really just crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s,” he said. “This is a global emergency that’s shutting down society and relatively so, this is probably the biggest intervention to date that might actually reduce some of the burden in our communities.” Who decides who gets prioritized for vaccination? The Canadian government assembled a team of experts and officials months ago to prepare for vaccine rollout, including logistics and prioritization. From an operations standpoint, a Canadian military general is heading the rollout. From a prioritization standpoint, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), a long-established body that includes public health, infectious disease, and immunization policy experts, created a vaccine prioritization framework, released in early November. The framework determined that people and staff at long-term care facilities should be immunized first, then other health care workers and vulnerable populations, and finally the general population. Will vaccination be required in certain circumstances? Is there precedent for that? It’s possible that vaccination could be required in certain education, health care and travel circumstances, said Chagla, and there is precedent for it. In parts of South America and Africa, travellers are required to present a “yellow fever vaccination certificate” to prove they are immune from the virus and won’t set off an outbreak. In Canadian schools, some provinces require children and adolescents to be immunized from a variety of illnesses before they can attend school, unless they have a medical exemption. “I think you’re going to see some fairly forward-facing industries like travel industries, health care, schools, where this is probably going to be part of the mandate,” said Chagla, noting that mandatory vaccinations get “dicey” when it comes to employment law. While no one can be forced to get an eventual COVID-19 vaccine, ethicists have urged for more clarity around what the rollout of vaccines will mean, including for millions of people who may choose not to get one. “That is an ethical concern because what will likely happen to people within that group is more and more opportunities may slowly be shut off to them,” Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, told CTV National News. What are the side-effects of a COVID-19 vaccine? Common side-effects will have already been identified since most adverse events associated with vaccines occur within a day of receiving the shot, said Bogoch, the most common of which is a sore arm. “There are certain rare vaccine side effects that can occur two to four weeks after vaccination. They’re not very common at all,” he said, adding that early data suggests the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine candidates, which use a relatively new mRNA technology, have not resulted in any notable side effects other than people feeling “fatigued or a little unwell” in the day following vaccination. How exactly do the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines differ from the AstraZeneca vaccine? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both “messenger RNA” or mRNA vaccines, which is a new kind of vaccine technology that is like “giving an instruction booklet for your cells to make antigens,” said Chakrabarti in a phone interview with CTVNews.ca last month. In the absence of the coronavirus, a person’s cells would still be programmed to develop the antibodies that fight the virus off. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed by Oxford University scientists in England, uses a more well-established approach that introduces a cold virus common in chimpanzees. The vaccine alters the chimp virus, called a modified adenovirus vector, to mimic COVID-19 and thereby produce an immune response in the human body. Will the vaccines still be 95 per cent effective after they roll out? Probably not. While study participants represented a wide spectrum of ages and ethnicities, they were also all generally healthy people, said Chagla in a phone interview with CTVNews.ca in November. In the past, when vaccines for other illnesses rolled out, they may have had strong data from clinical trials too. “But they’re not necessarily as good as patients get more complex, as their medications get more complex and their immune system diseases are more complex,” he said, so defining the efficacy of a vaccine after rollout becomes a difficult task. “More surveillance, more data, once it comes to the market, will probably tell us what the real life efficacy of these vaccines are,” he said. “I would suggest it will probably be a little less than this 95 per cent.” Will the vaccine require “booster” shots? It’s too early to know. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, separated by two weeks, but the second is not considered a “booster” shot, which are given to prevent immunity from waning. “We don’t have a clue how long immunity will last,” said Bogoch over the phone with CTVNews.ca in November. “We’ll have clues about this longer-term after people are vaccinated to see how long immunity will last.” Booster shots are typically given several years after the first, though children will often receive them earlier to provide a more “robust immune response,” said Chagla. “For most adult vaccinations you have a series [of doses], and things like the pneumonia shot or tetanus shot you do at five, 10-year intervals after getting it just knowing that immunity wanes in some of the older populations,” he said. Are the vaccines administered at extremely low temperatures? The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccine candidates all have different requirements for transportation and storage. Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be kept at -70 C during those stages to remain effective, but it is not administered into someone’s veins at that temperature, assured Bogoch. “God, that would suck. You’d get frostbite. That would cause tremendous damage,” he said. “The Pfizer vaccine is stable for about five days in a conventional refrigerator. The Moderna vaccine needs to be stored at -20 C but it’s stable in a refrigerator for about 30 days.” The AstraZeneca vaccine candidate can be stored between 2 C and 8 C, which experts consider a major logistical advantage for areas of the country that don’t have access to ultra-cold freezers. Will we need to arrange a doctors’ appointment or can we visit a pharmacy like we can for the flu shot? The specifics of the rollout are still being developed or have not yet been announced to Canadians, but experts expect there to be a variety of methods by which people will be vaccinated. Where someone lives may determine which vaccine they receive by which method. “It’s going to depend on what vaccine is locally available, what resources are in that region to actually administer them,” said Chagla, noting the different storage temperatures required of the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca candidates. “I think you’re going to see a lot of different models. You’re going to see family doctor models, drive-thru models, hospital models, models where people are going into long-term care facilities and plastering it among patients and staff,” he said. “You might get other ways of administering it, like mass vaccination clinics.” Will we have to wait hours in line or will there be registration? Recent lessons from the administration of influenza vaccines may be informing how a COVID-19 vaccine is rolled out, said Chagla, who expects there to be less reliance on lining up at local pharmacies. “We can’t have people standing in long lineups, particularly in the era of COVID-19,” he said. “People getting COVID waiting for a COVID vaccine seems like fairly poor optics in that sense.” Can a vaccinated person still pass on the virus? If someone is vaccinated and they come into contact with the virus, one of two things is going to happen, said Bogoch: “You’re either going to get the infection, or you’re not.” Early data from COVID-19 vaccine trials suggests that the probability of getting the infection is significantly lower in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people. Similarly, the early data suggests severe illness is also less common in people who are vaccinated. “It’s extremely important to note that we don’t have the data available, and we're only going by the snippets of data that we do have available,” he added. A very small number of people die from COVID-19. Do we need a vaccine at all? Yes. While a minority of people get sick and die from COVID-19, that small group of people can still overwhelm the hospital system, said Chakrabarti. “Once that happens, there’s a ripple affect that has effects on everybody’s health,” he said, noting cancer screening appointments are cancelled and elective operations are postponed. As of Dec. 1, some of the largest hospitals in Canada were nearing capacity, threatening widespread cancellations of non-emergency surgeries that would further extend a health care backlog. While some have suggested protecting the elderly and letting the virus “rip” through society to allow for natural herd immunity, Chakrabarti says it’s very difficult to protect all vulnerable people and the consequences of such a strategy can’t be understated. “The cost of doing that is that you would overrun hospitals and there would be all sorts of collateral damage,” he said. Is there a benefit to getting more than one vaccine? Maybe, but it’s unlikely that individual people will get each of the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, or some other combination of vaccines, during the first rollout, said Chakrabarti. “This stuff will be honed in the coming years as we start to get to know more and more. There is a precedent for using vaccines of slightly different mechanisms to give you a synergistic type of effect,” he said, noting that high-risk populations are inoculated with both pneumonia vaccines on the market for a more powerful affect. There’s also added benefit to having multiple vaccines on the market, whether or not an individual person receives multiple shots. The differences in the storage requirements alone provide important benefits, particularly to the developing world, noted Chagla. “Right now it’s just a race to get a vaccine on the market rather than necessarily saying ‘What’s the optimal strategy?’” he said. “As things go on, we’re probably going to get more and more data to say which one is better in kids, which one is better in the elderly, which one is better in certain settings, or with certain medications. That’s the benefit fo having multiple on the market.” Will we go back to normal right away? While some experts expect a feeling of “normal” to return at some point next year, a complete return to normal might not come until 2022. “The rollout of the vaccine is a gargantuan task,” said Chakrabarti. “I do completely expect that things will be back to normal sometime in 2022. I think 2021 will be a gradual and stepwise improvement in our daily lives and the case count.” Chagla expects people will begin to “step off the brake” once the most vulnerable populations are vaccinated in the early months of 2021. Summer could be close to normal, he added. “We’re going to see ‘normal’ starting to show up more and more and more as some of those higher-risk settings get more and more vaccinated,” he said.

CTVNews.ca has analyzed the document and identified the key items that, if passed in Parliament, will impact Canadian businesses, workers, families, students, and seniors. Here’s how the Liberals’ pandemic exit strategy impacts you: IS THE COST OF CHILD CARE A FINANCIAL STRAIN? Canadian families across the country, aside from Quebecers, continue to grapple with the increasingly high costs of child care. While child care remains a provincial issue, the federal government is promising measures to help its provincial counterparts establish a more consistent and affordable framework. The government is proposing to cut down on the costs of regulated child care in the country to $10 per day on average within the next five years. By the end of 2022, the government is aiming to see a 50 per cent decrease in average fees. Support from Ottawa to the provinces would focus on enhancing training and boosting wages for early childhood educators, creating more affordable child-care spaces, and funding not-for-profit sector child-care providers. Part of this work would also include supporting the needs of Indigenous families, including improving before- and after-school learning for First Nations children on reserve. The government is proposing to put money aside to see the capacity of the Federal Secretariat on Early Learning and Child Care role strengthened, one of the main objectives being the development of a new National Advisory Council to dig into any new challenges facing the early learning and child-care sector. SEARCHING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING? Low interest rates and a lack of housing supply have meant a surge in the cost to purchase a home. The pandemic has also reinforced wealth gaps and left many having to turn to public housing options. The Liberals are proposing to make affordable housing more available. A sizable chunk of money is set aside for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation over seven years to: ramp up the Rapid Housing Initiative, of which 25 per cent of funding will go specifically to service women-focused housing needs; invest in the Affordable Housing Innovation Fund; prop up the Canada Housing Benefit; and bolster the Federal Community Housing Initiative. The government is also proposing to reallocate previously announced funding through the National Housing Co-Investment Fund and the Rental Construction Financing Initiative. Capital Dispatch: Stay up to date on the latest news from Parliament Hill The budget earmarks money specifically for the construction of 30 new public housing units across the Northwest Territories and approximately 100 new housing units in Nunavut. The Liberals are also committing to ending “chronic” homelessness in Canada, with millions going to Reaching Home – the government’s strategy combat homelessness – and another chunk going to the creation of a pilot program to reduce veteran-specific homelessness. Following on their announcement in the fall economic statement, the government is promising to put the steps in motion to implement a national, annual one per cent tax on “the value of non-resident, non-Canadian owned residential real estate that is considered to be vacant or underused, effective January 1, 2022.” ARE YOU A SENIOR IN LONG-TERM CARE OR STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET? The disastrous living conditions within long-term care facilities, and the way COVID-19 tore through those facilities, is widely seen as one of the more eye-opening social injustices of the pandemic. The government acknowledged this reality in the budget and has proposed some solutions to ensure better treatment of our elders. The budget sees billions going to Health Canada to support the provinces and territories to develop national standards of long-term care. Millions will also go to Statistics Canada to improve data collection and infrastructure on “supportive care, primary care, and pharmaceuticals.” The government is also proposing a new initiative dubbed the Age Well at Home initiative to make it easier for seniors to age where they are through community supports. To help with immediate pandemic needs, the Liberals are pitching to deliver a one-time payment of $500 in August to those who will be 75 and over as of June 2022. In the long-term, they will introduce legislation to raise Old Age Security payments by 10 per cent “on an ongoing basis” as of July 2022. ARE YOU A STUDENT RACKING UP DEBT? As the budget reads, young people were among the “hardest and fastest hit” by pandemic unemployment, “experiencing more job losses than any other age demographic.” Couple that with pre-pandemic student debt and the situation becomes worse. It’s for this reason the government is prioritizing support to this group. The government is proposing to transition students and recent grads from the Canada Student Loans Program to a new Canada Student Financial Assistance Program that will “make student debt easier to pay down and provide direct support to students with the greatest need.” The budget also details a legislative plan to absorb interest accrued from the student loans and Canada Apprentice Loans programs until March 31, 2023. Through the pandemic, the Liberals doubled the amount of money accessible through the Canada Student Grants initiative for the 2020-21 school year. Their intention is to extend the amount until the end of July 2023. The government plans to extend disability supports under the Canada Student Loans Program to cover individuals whose disabilities are prolonged but not permanent. The budget sees millions going toward connecting students to jobs, with money going to the Student Work Placement Program, which the government expects would provide approximately 50,000 young people work opportunities over the next several years. It also proposes to dish over money to build up the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, namely to support vulnerable youth and it plans to invest in the Canada Summer Jobs program to produce approximately 75,000 new job placements in the summer of 2022. IS THE PANDEMIC KEEPING YOU JOBLESS? If you are still out of a job due to the pandemic, which applies to approximately 300,000 Canadians, and the likelihood of returning to permanent work looks grim, the government is promising to prolong some of its key income supports through to the fall. The government is proposing to tack on 12 additional weeks to the Canada Recovery Benefit application period, to a maximum of 50 weeks. To eventually wean recipients off of the emergency support, the first four weeks would be paid out at the regular $500 per week amount but would decrease to $300 per week for the remaining eight weeks. A similar extension would be applied to the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, which would be stretched out for an additional four weeks, to a maximum of 42 weeks at $500 per week. The government is also proposing to make immediate legislative changes to Canada’s Employment Insurance (EI) program to ensure it remains easy to access over the coming years. They also set aside money for future, long-term EI reform consultations, such as “the need for income support for self-employed and gig workers.” The budget proposes to pour billions into extending sickness benefits, available under EI, from 15 to 26 weeks, which would come into effect in the summer of 2022. It also promises to make amendments to the Employment Insurance Act and the Canadian Labour Code to ensure job protection while accessing those sickness benefits. IS YOUR BUSINESS STILL STRUGGLING? If you are one of the many business owners still reliant on the government’s suite of job protection benefits, the budget pledges that support will continue to at least July, and for some until early fall. The exact timing of the phasing-out will be based on the efficiency of the vaccine rollout, the government says. The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy will be extended to Sept. 25, but the subsidy rate would gradually decrease beginning on July 4. It will be replaced eventually with the new Canada Recovery Hiring Program, which is proposed to span from June to November. To encourage corporations, charities, non-profits and others to hire new or previously laid-off workers as the economy rebounds, this initiative would “offset a portion of the extra costs employers take on as they reopen.” “It’s an effort on our part to begin the process of moving from the protecting of jobs – a very important objective during the pandemic, the protecting of jobs and the protecting of the link between workers and their employers – to helping businesses now create jobs,” said a senior government official about the new hiring initiative during the budget briefing. The Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy and Lockdown Support, set to expire in June, will also continue to run until the same September end date. Similar to the CEWS, that support will gradually decrease as vaccinations ramp up and the economy reopens. The government recently extended the application deadline for the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) to June 30, given the continued financial strain of the pandemic. The budget proposes to do the same for the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund and the Indigenous Business Initiative.

In a report released Thursday, CSIS says it has observed persistent and advanced state-sponsored threat activity targeting elections for many years and ""continues to see a rise in its frequency and sophistication."" CSIS points to social media being leveraged to spread disinformation or run foreign-influenced campaigns designed to confuse or divide public opinion, or interfere in healthy public debate. The service advises that although Canada's electoral system is strong, foreign interference can erode trust and threaten the integrity of the country's democratic institutions, political system, fundamental rights and freedoms, and ultimately, its sovereignty. The spy service's warning comes amid speculation Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will pull the plug on the minority Parliament in coming weeks, sending Canadians to the polls. ""The Canadian public and voters are targeted by foreign interference as they are generally viewed by state actors as vulnerable targets,"" the CSIS report says. ""In particular, elections provide valuable opportunities for state actors to conduct disinformation and interference campaigns."" Elected and public officials, interest groups, community organizations and media are also potential targets, the spy service says. Tactics include manipulating people into divulging valuable information, cultivation of relationships for ulterior motives, coercion, illicit financing, cyberattacks, disinformation and espionage. CSIS is a member of the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections task force, which co-ordinates efforts to protect federal ballots. The report does not single out countries with malicious intent or reveal specific plots waged against Canada. However, federal officials have previously cautioned that Canada is targeted by foreign states such as China and Russia as they seek to advance their political, economic and security interests. For example, Russia and its intelligence services have been actively engaged in disinformation campaigns since March 2020 to sow doubt about the origins of the novel coronavirus as well as the means required to counter it, says a recent briefing note prepared for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair. China and other foreign states routinely attempt to threaten and intimidate individuals around the world through various state entities and non-state proxies, the April note warns. These states may use a combination of their intelligence and security services as well as trusted agents to assist them in foreign interference activity on Canadian soil, it says. ""While states may attempt to threaten and intimidate individuals in order to pursue fighting corruption or to bring criminals to justice, these tactics can also be used as cover for silencing dissent, pressuring political opponents and instilling a general fear of state power no matter where a person is located.""

(Charles Rex Arbogast / AP) Share: Reddit Share Text: Walt Disney Co. is expected to close most of its Canadian stores this summer as part of the company's broader plan to focus on its e-commerce business and reduce its brick-and-mortar footprint. The mass media and entertainment conglomerate says it's closing at least 60 stores across North America, including most of its locations in Canada. The Disney Store, a chain of specialty stores selling Disney-themed toys, costumes and other items, currently has 16 locations in Canada listed on its website. According to the store locator, three locations in British Columbia are already permanently closed, while four stores in Alberta, one in Manitoba, and four in Ontario are slated to close on or before Aug. 18. Two Ontario stores continued to be listed as open, while the remaining two locations in that province are outlets that continue to be open. Stephanie Young, Disney's president of consumer products, games and publishing, says the pandemic has changed what consumers expect from a retailer while shifting more shopping online. The company plans to create a more ""flexible, interconnected e-commerce experience,"" she said in a statement earlier this year. Retail analyst Bruce Winder says Disney has likely found more efficient ways to drive its brand and merchandise. He says he expects the company will eventually connect its e-commerce platform shopDisney to its subscription streaming service Disney+. The closure of Disney stores in Canada is part of sweeping changes hitting the retail industry and malls, Winder says. ""Malls are going to change considerably in terms of what they do and how they operate and what kind of stores are in there,"" he says.

Speaking alongside Quebec Premier Francois Legault, who announced his province would be instituting a vaccine passport amid concerns over rising case counts, the prime minister said he's also looking at whether new requirements to either require or encourage vaccination would be necessary in federal workplaces or in federally-regulated industries such as banking, rail and air travel, and Parliament. ""I've asked the Clerk of the Privy Council, who is responsible for the federal public service, to look at mandatory vaccinations for federal employees. And we're also looking at federally-regulated industries, to encourage or perhaps even to mandate vaccinations for those industries,"" Trudeau said. Coronavirus vaccination tracker: How many people in Canada have received shots? ""It is time that the 80 per cent of Canadians who are doing their duty towards their neighbours, towards their loved ones by getting vaccinated, be able to get back more and more to normal, get back more and more to regular life. For that, those who are hesitant: It's time to get your vaccine. They're safe, they're effective,"" he continued. Until now, Trudeau has largely left questions about requiring proof of vaccination to participate in certain aspects of society up to each province, though the federal government has moved forward with eased travel restrictions for those who are fully vaccinated. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced that he would be requiring all federal workers report their vaccination status and any worker who does not, will have to follow safety rules like mask-wearing and weekly testing. ""This is under discussion. I think the federal government being significant workforce is looking at how we best protect our workforce, as well as those around us,"" Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said on Thursday. She said that the Treasury Board and departmental occupational health and safety staff are also involved in these discussions. ""I can't sort of preempt what the outcome of those discussions might be, but again, to emphasize that it's really important for workplaces to — if we're going to have people come back to work — that everyone should get the vaccine,"" Tam said, adding that part of the consideration is who these workers are interacting with in their jobs. UNIONS WANT DETAILS The proposal has the tentative backing of at least one major federal public service union so far, but the key will be in the details. Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada vice-president Stephane Aubry told CTV News that his union thinks there should be accommodations offered for those who don’t roll up their sleeve. “It has been a question in the air for a while,” he said. “What we're more concerned [about] is what will be the effect of, if some of our members that we represent cannot, or will not be vaccinated, we want to make sure that in the plan, there would be ways for those members to still have a job.” Though, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) says it wants to see a full proposal before weighing in on whether the policy would be supportable. ""Given that many of our members are already being asked to return to federal workplaces, we would urge the government to both provide a clear position as soon as possible, and to ensure that any measures they propose take into consideration our members’ health and safety, their human rights as well as privacy, and the protection of the public. We also expect the government to meaningfully consult with unions before making any decisions that could significantly impact our members,” said PSAC National president Chris Aylward in a statement. In an interview, Ottawa-based employment lawyer Paul Champ said that there are a few ways the federal government could make vaccines mandatory, but the most likely avenue would be that cabinet agrees to change the regulations under the Canada Labour Code, which governs occupational health and safety and federal workplaces. “The government would have to be looking closely at the current public health risks that are associated with COVID, you know, given the high voluntary level of vaccination. I think the government would have to go a little bit further in terms of the evidence to justify that kind of a measure, or they should be prepared to do so,” Champ said. In statements responding to the news, both Via Rail and WestJet said they are already strongly recommending that their employees get vaccinated, though the National Airlines Council of Canada said it has not yet heard directly from the government about it’s possible vaccination requirements. “Our members and industry will continue to collaborate with all governments in Canada to support on-going vaccination efforts,” said council president Mike McNaney in a statement. Asked about Trudeau considering mandatory vaccination for federal workplaces, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh didn’t have a firm position. “When it comes to the vaccination, we need to work with everyone involved. So that means working with workers’ unions, making sure we work with everybody,” he said. New survey data released by Nanos Research suggests that three in four Canadians support or somewhat support mandatory vaccinations for people who are eligible, in order to help control the spread of new COVID-19 variants. “Mandatory vaccines in certain areas make a lot of sense… from a federal standpoint it could be leading by example,” said Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician at Trillium Health Partners. “I think that could be something quite helpful. That said, I think there are a lot of reasons why people are vaccine hesitant and it’s important we realize it’s not one group. We have to approach that in different ways.” COMES AMID ELECTION CONCERNS The prime minister’s mandatory vaccination comments come amid ongoing concerns about an uptick in new COVID-19 infections that federal public health officials have cautioned could be the start of a ""Delta-driven"" fourth wave. In light of this, Trudeau faced repeated questions about whether he is planning to launch the country into an election campaign in the coming days or weeks, which he continued to deflect, insisting his focus is on vaccinations and ""delivering for Canadians… even as we move forward."" While he was out for a campaign-style event with a candidate on Thursday at a local market, Singh continues to advocate against a summer election call. “All the sacrifices that Canadians have made could be put in jeopardy by calling an election that, by the very nature an election will require some gatherings, whether people are going into line to vote, whether people are coming together to make decisions,” Singh said. Tam said Thursday that if an election is called there will be measures in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at in-person polling places, in addition to Elections Canada preparing for an uptick in mail-in ballots. “There are definitely ways to vote safely… I think it's great to have an option, but in-person voting can be done safely,” she said. VACCINATING IN SCHOOLS On Wednesday, Ontario announced that it would not force eligible students to be immunized against COVID-19 in order to be able to go back to school in-person. On Thursday, Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath clarified her position on mandatory vaccines for education workers, saying that she supports it. Speaking about the return to classrooms generally, Trudeau said Thursday that two of his three children — Ella-Grace and Xavier — were eligible to be immunized and just received their second doses a few days ago, while his youngest Hadrien will be entering Grade 2 in September and won't be able to be immunized. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox ""Yes, as a father, I worry,"" Trudeau said in French, going on to encourage everyone who is eligible to do their part now and get vaccinated to help fight a possible new surge in infections. ""It is time, if you've been hesitant to get your first dose, to book your second dose, to move forward. The Delta variant is posing real challenges,"" Trudeau said, noting that there are currently enough doses in the country to administer to anyone eligible who wants to be vaccinated.

PHAC says back-to-school guidelines coming Sharon Lindores CTVNews.ca Writer @CTVNews.ca Writer Contact Published Wednesday, August 4, 2021 2:59PM EDT Last Updated Wednesday, August 4, 2021 2:59PM EDT Share: Reddit Share Text: TORONTO -- As schools get ready to welcome students back to the classroom in September they’re outlining measures to keep everyone safe from COVID-19, but there’s growing concern about what that means for the youngest cohort. Canada hasn’t approved a vaccine yet for children under the age of 12. And only about 37 per cent of children between the ages of 12 and 17 have been fully vaccinated. That means precautions are needed. And the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) plans to release guidance for schools, including those with children under the age of 12, in the next few weeks, agency spokesperson Anne Génier said on Wednesday. “It takes into consideration important factors such as transmission dynamics in school settings and child/youth populations, community vaccine coverage, as well as indicators like COVID-19 epidemiology, healthcare and public health capacity, and risk reduction measures in place,” Génier said. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox In the meantime, various pandemic rules remain and schools are laying out plans. “We’re now starting to hear about back-to-school protocols across the country,” Toronto-based infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said Wednesday on CTV's Your Morning. “Many of them have a focus on masking, distancing, ventilation etc. These are all measures that can create safer indoor environments.” The key will be how well they’re implemented, he said. “That will determine whether or not schools are a major focus and a major driver of COVID-19 as we enter the fall.” Bogoch said he expects Health Canada may approve a vaccine for children under the age of 12 in the late fall, early winter. In July, PHAC said in an emailed statement that “all manufacturers of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in Canada are conducting or planning studies in adolescents and younger children,” and that the organization, expected data “in the coming months.” “At this time, no submission has been received for the approval of any COVID-19 vaccine in children under 12 years of age,” the statement said. Meanwhile, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, released modelling on Friday that indicates COVID-19 cases are beginning to rise as a result of the more contagious Delta variant. To date, there have been about 1.4 million cases of COVID-19 in Canada and about 7,795 are active. About 59.89 per cent of the country’s 38.1 million people are fully vaccinated. It’s important for people to be vigilant and to take precautions due to the rapid spread of the variant and the expected flu season in the fall. “We certainly know kids can get infected [with COVID-19] and we know they can transmit this infection,” Bogoch said. And while children don’t tend to get as sick as older people, some are hit hard by COVID-19. “You still can’t ignore that there are a small percentage of kids that do get acutely ill,” Bogoch said. And according to recent studies, it’s estimated that 1.8 per cent of kids may have long-term symptoms, he said.

After months of speculation over the prospect of a pandemic election, sources, speaking on a not-for-attribution basis, said that Trudeau is planning to visit Rideau Hall this weekend and ask Gov. Gen. Mary Simon to dissolve the 43rd Parliament and draw up the 338 writs of election. However, sources indicated that it is still possible that the prime minister could adjust his plans. If the campaign kicks off this Sunday, with an election day on Sept. 20, the 2021 federal election would be 36 days in length, the shortest possible permitted under elections law. Triggering the election means that Canadians would be in for at least five weeks of campaigning, seeing the federal party leaders crisscrossing the country and pitching themselves, their candidates, and their platforms, under ongoing COVID-19 public health restrictions. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign While the next fixed election date isn’t until October 2023, minority governments rarely last the full four years between elections. In the 2019 federal election, voters reduced the Liberal majority to a minority and since then there’s been a series of shakeups on the political scene, from the election of new opposition leaders and recent invigoration over social justice issues, to the ongoing global pandemic that has upended much of life as Canadians knew it. In his anticipated post-election call remarks from outside Rideau Hall on Sunday, Trudeau will have to explain to the electorate why he felt it was necessary to put the country into an election now, while reopening and vaccination efforts are still underway. The news was first reported by Reuters, and came just as Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam held a press conference announcing that the country has now entered a fourth wave of the pandemic, driven by the Delta variant and mostly impacting the unvaccinated. “We have been closely monitoring increases in COVID-19 activity across the country. The latest national surveillance data indicate that a fourth wave is underway in Canada and that cases are plotting along a strong resurgence trajectory,” she said. There are currently more than 13,000 active cases in Canada, more than double the number from late July. Ready or not? Canadians apprehensive as parties brace for an election call With cases on the rise again, it will be up to the electorate to decide whether Trudeau deserves another chance to steer the country through, and out of it, or if in their minds it’s time for a change. Both Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh have spoken out against a snap election, though all sides have already been engaging in pseudo-electioneering all summer long. Parties have also been pushing ahead with nominating candidates, putting in place key campaign staff and sorting logistics like renting campaign planes and buses, while pledging to follow all local pandemic precautions. “While Justin Trudeau wants to just act like it's over, it's not over, and people are still worried,” Singh said on Thursday, unveiling his party’s campaign platform on Thursday morning. “And if Justin Trudeau was listening to people, and their concerns, and their worries he would not be holding a selfish summer election.” Jetting off across the country over the last few weeks and resuming in-person announcements, Trudeau deflected suggestions that he was conducting a pre-campaign test run, or eyeing a visit to Rideau Hall. Though, he has spoken repeatedly about how in his mind Parliament has become “toxic” and unworkable due to opposition obstruction, claims the other parties have rebuked given the Liberals were still able to pass key bills and maintain the confidence of the House of Commons. Despite his election deflections, recent polls from various public opinion outlets have signalled that the Liberals could be within reach of a majority government if a vote was held soon, which could also be feeding into the arguments from opposition parties to hold off. “The latest Nanos tracking suggests that the Liberals have a double digit advantage… But the day the election is called… it'll be a complete reset on where things are at,” said Nanos Research's Nik Nanos in an interview with CTV News. “I think for the Liberals what they're hoping for is a smash and grab victory where a short election occurs, they don't make a lot of mistakes, and they hope to cruise on what I'll say their track record fighting the pandemic. The longer the election, the greater the scrutiny on the government of the day, and the more time for the opposition parties to try to tear down the government,” Nanos said. Recent polling data from Nanos Research, commissioned by CTV News, indicated that the majority of Canadians aren’t that enthusiastic about an election right now, with most Canadians just trying to try to put the pandemic behind them and to start to reconnect with loved ones. Canada's Chief Electoral Officer Stephane Perrault has spoken favourably of having a longer writ period to allow Elections Canada to have a longer runway to get all elements of a national election in place, but the agency says it is nevertheless ready to safely conduct a vote. Should the Governor General agree to dissolve Parliament, all outstanding business in both the House of Commons and Senate that was not passed when both chambers adjourned in June will die, and all parliamentary committees essentially cease to exist, leaving it up to the next government to restart a legislative agenda. The government, and the bureaucracy in each federal department and agency, will enter a ""caretaker"" mode in which major decisions are limited. During the process of dissolving a Parliament there are typically three steps: dismissing the senators and members; calling the next Parliament and ordering the writs to be issued; and setting the date for when Parliament will next meet after the writs are returned with the results. Writs are written orders instructing the returning officer in each of the 338 federal ridings to hold an election to select a member of Parliament. Heading into the campaign, here's the current seat breakdown in the House of Commons: Liberal: 155 Conservative: 119 Bloc Québécois: 32 NDP: 24 Independent: 5 Green Party: 2 A party needs to win 170 seats for a majority government. As of Thursday, the Liberals have nominated 250 candidates, the Conservatives have nominated 291 candidates, the NDP have nominated 169 candidates, and the Greens have 112 candidates nominated. The Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in Quebec’s 78 ridings, has nominated 41. With files from CTV News’ Sarah Turnbull, Michel Boyer and Joyce Napier.

And there are some rural or remote areas where vaccination rates are lagging compared to other parts of the country, stifling efforts to control the virus. While Canada's vaccination rates are among some of the highest in the world, some of the country's lowest can be found in the Prairies. In the northern part of Alberta, the region of High Level, which has a population includes the 3,000 residents of the town of High Level and more than 20,000 residents in nearby communities and rural areas, reports having only 16 per cent of its eligible population immunized with at least one dose. According to provincial data, the region of Forty Mile is also struggling to get needles in arms with roughly 30.7 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated, followed by Two Hills County at 32.6 per cent. However, Alberta health officials have said that these numbers may be low because First Nations reserves in the province ran their own vaccination drives and those numbers are not included in regional tallies. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox In Manitoba, only 21.6 per cent of the eligible population in the rural municipality of Stanley has been vaccinated, according to provincial data. The community of Hanover is also reporting a low vaccination rate, where just under 45 per cent of the eligible population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Officials in the province say there are a number of factors keeping residents from getting vaccinated, including difficulty accessing vaccines, medical reasons, religious beliefs, and misinformation. The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health told CTVNews.ca on Tuesday that the province's vaccination rate is lowest in the Far North Central region where 46 per cent of eligible residents have received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 33 per cent have both doses. A spokesperson for the province's Ministry of Health said in an email that the province encourages everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated, highlighting that recent infections in Saskatchewan are occurring in those who have not gotten the jab. ""More than 90 per cent of all new cases and hospitalizations in Saskatchewan in July were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people. Ninety-five per cent of ICU admissions were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, and 100 per cent of deaths were unvaccinated,"" a spokesperson for Saskatchewan Ministry of Health said. Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, released federal modelling data in July that indicated that COVID-19 cases are beginning to rise as a result of the more contagious Delta variant. However, she said there is still time to flatten the curve. “The updated longer-range forecast shows how the epidemic trajectory may evolve through early September. It suggests that we are at the start of the Delta-driven fourth wave, but that the trajectory will depend on ongoing increases in fully vaccinated coverage, and the timing, pace and extent of reopening,” Tam said. Federal data reports that there are approximately six million eligible Canadians who have yet to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated. According to data tracked by CTVNews.ca, 81.4 per cent of the eligible population age 12 and over have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 70.3 per cent are fully vaccinated, as of Tuesday afternoon.

The country is seeing an increase in new COVID-19 cases, and thousands more infections are predicted if contacts aren’t contained, the modelling indicates. The new picture on Canada’s pandemic trajectory shows the serious threat the highly-contagious Delta variant is posing, and the risk that the unvaccinated may be to the country being thrust into a fourth wave of the disease. “The updated longer-range forecast shows how the epidemic trajectory may evolve through early September. It suggests that we are at the start of the Delta-driven fourth wave, but that the trajectory will depend on ongoing increases in fully vaccinated coverage, and the timing, pace and extent of reopening,” Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox After weeks of sustained decline in new cases, the Public Health Agency of Canada is warning that if community-wide contact rates increase too quickly with ongoing reopening efforts, the long-term forecast indicates Canada could experience a “stronger resurgence” of the virus. Ultimately, factoring in the spread of Delta, hospital capacity could be exceeded this fall or winter if more people don’t get vaccinated, the modelling indicates. The predominance of the Delta variant “underscores the need for high vaccination coverage and continued caution as restrictions are eased,” the modelling states. The Public Health Agency of Canada's aim is to see as many eligible Canadians vaccinated this summer as possible. As of midday Friday, 80.5 per cent of those eligible have received a first dose, while 65.8 per cent of those eligible are now fully vaccinated. “If we can get to 90 [per cent vaccinated], I’ll be popping over the champagne for sure,” Tam said. The new data predicts that in the short-term, the case count will continue to increase, meaning the country could see between 2,700 and 11,800 new cases over the next week or so. As of midday Friday, there have been 1,429,937 reported cases nationwide, and by Aug. 8 that number could grow to between 1,432,555 to 1,441,610 cases. One sign that Canada’s case counts are on an upward trajectory: the national “Rt” or effective reproduction number, recently started trending above one around mid-July, meaning there are “early signs of epidemic growth” in some regions. This comes after the “Rt” had remained out of a growth pattern since April. “If the ‘Rt’ remains persistently above one for several weeks, with the predominance of the highly contagious Delta variant, we could expect to see a return to rapid epidemic growth, particularly as measures that slow the spread are eased,” said Tam. PHAC says it saw a five-fold increase in the proportion of Delta cases in June, reminding that Delta cases have an increased risk for hospitalization, and has reduced vaccine effectiveness against a symptomatic infection. Further, the majority of the Delta cases in Canada are in those who are unvaccinated, or are partially vaccinated. “People seem to be, in certain areas, tired and forgetting about science, which is unfortunate,” said Dr. Lisa Barrett, an infectious disease expert and assistant professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, in an interview on CTV News Channel. “We know at this point that we are going to live with the virus… however we don't have enough data, information, vaccination, ways to treat this virus… we don’t have enough of that knowledge yet to expect to treat this just like another respiratory virus,” she continued. 89.7 PER CENT OF CASES UNVACCINATED In an indication that the vaccines are working, the modelling does not anticipate the rate of new deaths to increase along with the uptick in new cases. The modelling shows that regionally, hospitalization rates remain low, with fewer than one per cent of reported cases and fewer than one per cent of hospitalized cases occurring in people who are fully vaccinated. The flipside of this statistic though, is that 89.7 per cent of all cases are occurring in eligible, but unvaccinated people, and 84.9 per cent of hospitalized cases are people who are unvaccinated. Another 5.3 per cent of cases are in those who are not yet eligible for vaccines, and 4.6 per cent of infections are in those who are partially vaccinated. Tam said it’s also mostly those who are unvaccinated who are dying after contracting COVID-19. The federal health officials are now pushing to see a marked increase in vaccination rates in younger populations, warning that if they don’t increase in the coming months, Canada could face a “serious resurgence” this fall or winter. Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo called out the approximately 6.3 million eligible Canadians who have yet to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated. “What are you waiting for?” said Njoo. “This is all very preventable if people go forward and get vaccinated, so let's go for it. Let's go.” Generally speaking, the rate of vaccination decreases in each younger demographic. During the early stages of the rollout, older generations were often prioritized for vaccination ahead of younger ones. As of last week the percentages in each age group who are fully vaccinated are: 89 per cent of those aged 70 or older; 81 per cent of those aged 60-69; 70 per cent of those aged 50-59; 63 per cent of those aged 40-49; 54 per cent of those aged 30 to 39; 46 per cent of those aged 18 to 29; and 37 per cent of those aged 12 to 17. The data also breaks down how each province stacks up on vaccination rates, with Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, and Alberta still having the farthest to go in terms of fully vaccinating its eligible population, while the Yukon and Northwest Territories continue to lead the nation in vaccination rates.

From Canada to South Korea, every country has responded differently -- in some cases, quite significantly, resulting in vastly different outcomes. Curious how different countries are faring? You can chart and compare the progression for jurisdictions that have reported more than 100 cases using our interactive graphs below. An overview of the pandemic's progression -- from early containment measures to where things stand now -- are highlighted in a few, select examples below. For more in-depth maps, check out our Project Pandemic page, and for complete coverage, visit CTVNews.ca/coronavirus Jump to: World Health Organization, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Italy, New Zealand, United States, South Korea Provinces, territories and global jurisdictions with fewer than 100 cases are not included. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (TOP) The COVID-19 pandemic is arguably the most catastrophic and devastating global event since the Second World War, impacting billions of people across at least 185 countries. More than 118 million people had been infected and more than 2.63 million had died one year after the World Health Organization began using the world “pandemic”. The incredible speed with which vaccines have been developed and approved offers hope that perhaps an end to the pandemic is in sight, but the rise and spread of a number of variants in recent months combined with the extremely slow rollout of vaccines in many parts of the word appear to belie those hopes. The WHO was informed of several unusual cases of pneumonia in Wuhan on Dec. 31, 2019 and began requesting information from China on the cases. The agency sent a tweet on Jan. 4 and issued a press release on Jan. 5, 2020 regarding 44 cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause in China. By Jan. 30, the international health agency declared the outbreak a ""public health event of international concern"", amid 18 countries reporting a combined total of 83 cases, with seven involving no travel history to China and three countries reporting human-to-human transmission. According to a WHO spokeswoman, this declaration was meant to prevent a pandemic from happening. At this point, China had reported more than 7,700 confirmed cases, more than 12,000 suspected cases, and 170 people dead. The WHO advised all countries to prepare for containment, including early detection, isolation, contact tracing and to share their data with the WHO, but did not make recommendations on travel or trade restrictions at the time. The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV was officially named COVID-19 on Feb. 11 as the WHO warned against actions that promoted stigma or discrimination. By Feb. 21, the health agency was warning the international community that the window to contain the COVID-19 outbreak was narrowing, but did not formally start calling it a global pandemic until March 11, 2020. Six months after the declaration, data compiled by the AFP news agency found that roughly half of the world’s population -- some 3.9 billion -- had experienced some level of lockdown measure. At the official pandemic half-year point, there were nearly 30 million reported cases around the world, and more than 910,000 reported deaths. Following a drop in cases in many parts of the world over the summer in 2020, many regions, including Europe, began experiencing a “second wave” dramatically worse than the first. The 2020 to 2021 winter was particularly devastating, with worldwide cases roughly tripling between the beginning of October 2020 and the beginning of February 2021 alone. Cases have continued to rise into the spring, driven primarily by the spread of variants of concern that appear significantly more transmissible, as well as pandemic fatigue. Some countries, most notably the United States, experienced their third and worst wave over the winter, after seeing a second over the summer. Daily deaths through much of December 2020 into February 2021 regularly topped more than 3,000 in the U.S., a figure described by many news organizations as a “9/11 every day.” The aggressive deployment of vaccines in the U.S., however, has helped abate what was once the deadliest surge of COVID-19 in the world. Despite the grim overall picture, some parts of the world have managed to contain the outbreak with extremely low to zero infection through aggressive and effective policies, allowing millions of people to lead normal or nearly normal lives with few restrictions. Brazil (TOP) COVID-19 has devastated Brazil, with the virus and P.1 variant tearing through the South American country. Its health-care system has reached a “breaking point,” with one medical expert describing it as a “biological Fukushima” to Reuters. Brazil reported its first case on Feb. 25, 2020. Less than four months later, confirmed cases surpassed one million and nearly 49,000 people were dead. Half a year after the first reported case, infections had more than tripled to 3.67 million, while deaths reached nearly 116,600. Cases increased by a million during each subsequent month through the remainder of 2020. One year after the WHO began calling COVID-19a pandemic, Brazil reported nearly 273,000 lives lost and 11.28 million total cases, third only to the United States and India in total number of cases and second behind the U.S. in total number of deaths. It now stands second to the U.S. in total recorded infections. Despite the first reported case in February 2020, raw sewage samples from November and December 2019 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, according to a study published in March 2021, indicating that the virus was likely circulating in the Americas nearly two months before the continents’ first reported cases. Despite calling the public to follow health protocols at the very beginning, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was pushing to reopen businesses by April 2020, clashing with his health minister over strategies on how to handle the pandemic and eventually firing him; his replacement resigned less than a month later forthe same reasons. Initial plans to take strong containment action in mid-March after the pandemic was declared were significantly scaled back within a day due to “intervention” from Bolsonaro’s chief of staff’s office which, according to a Reuters report, was seen as a turning point for Brazil. Throughout the pandemic, Bolsonaro, who tested positive for COVID-19 in July 2020, has emphasized keeping the country’s economy running above all else, and opposed not only lockdown measures but also mask-wearing. The P.1 variant, first discovered in early December in Manaus, Brazil, has dramatically exacerbated the fast-accumulating infections and deaths across the country, with the daily number of cases hitting 100,000 and fatalities surpassing 3,800 in late March 2021. Scientists were alarmed by this variant early in part because it triggered an outbreak in Manaus even more deadly than the city’s first devastating outbreak a year earlier. The uncontrolled spring 2020 outbreak in the city of 2.2 million eventually infected some 76 per cent of the population, leading many experts to believe residents were close to or even above the threshold for herd immunity, according to an article in The Lancet. But a study in January 2021 found the P.1 variant was identified in 42 per cent of the samples sequenced from late December raising doubts about natural herd immunity and concerns over whether this variant could affect the ability for antibodies from either a previous infection or from vaccination to recognize the virus, according to the CDC. Health-care experts have called the situation in Brazil a “catastrophe”, but Bolsonaro and his allies have described it as “quite comfortable” compared to other countries and said the situation “isn’t all that critical.” CANADA (TOP) Since the pandemic was first declared in March 2020, many parts of Canada have struggled to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Some jurisdictions, like Atlantic Canada and the territories, managed to stay relatively free of COVID-19 through strict regional public health and travel protocols. But as scattered outbreaks in Nunavut -- which had managed to evade infections for most of the year -- and Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrate, circumstances can change quickly from a single case. Canada recorded its 10,000th infection within three weeks of WHO calling it a pandemic, and by mid-June 2020 had recorded 100,000 cases. More than 10,000 had died by Oct. 23, 2020. Half a million infections were documented by mid-December. Reaching another half a million took less time. The country hit the grim milestone of a million COVID-19 infections and 23,000 dead by the beginning of April 2021. The country’s first wave was a disaster for vulnerable long-term care residents, with upwards of 80 percent of COVID-19 deaths arising out of the long-term care homes primarily in Quebec and Ontario. National daily new cases peaked around 2,000, while daily deaths peaked at 244 at the end of April 2020. After managing to contain the number of daily new cases across Canada to the low hundreds throughout the summer, the second wave, which was dramatically worse than the first, began in the fall and did not peak until early January 2021 when daily new infections hit more than 9,200. As the second wave ebbed, experts in Ontario, for example, were already warning by early February that the variants of concern sweeping through the U.K., many parts of Africa, and Brazil, would drive a third wave that could be worse than the first two, especially if public health restrictions eased. In the beginning, a combination of lax border screening in the beginning, poor management at long-term care residences, and other missteps hampered containment efforts. The Public Health Agency of Canada formally activated its Emergency Operation Centre on Jan. 15, 2020, but unlike other countries that initiated screening measures for air passengers coming in from China early on, Canada did not initiate extra precautions until Jan. 22, when it added warning signs at major Canadian airports to raise awareness of the new novel coronavirus. New health screening requirements were also implemented for all passengers coming from China to airports in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. Three days later, on Jan. 25, the first case in Canada was confirmed in a patient returning from Wuhan, China. The federal government announced it would be repatriating Canadians in China at the end of January, as Global Affairs Canada increased its risk level for China to “avoid non-essential travel”, amid frustration among expats that the government was failing to communicate and help its citizens abroad. Those returning from China would be quarantined for two weeks. Over the coming days, airport screening requirements would be expanded. By Feb. 20, 2020 Canada confirmed its first case related to travel outside China. As the global situation appeared more dire, Canada’s minister of health recommended stockpiling food and medication “because things can change quickly.” By early March, B.C. confirmed the first case of community transmission in Canada, while Ontario reported its first evidence of it in mid-March. For a long time, however, the messaging from Canadian health officials was that the novel coronavirus outbreak risk for Canadians was low and that efforts would be concentrated on containing the spread. Government officials were also guided by advice from the World Health Organization, which had initially discouraged travel restrictions, border closures and the wearing of masks, positions that were later criticized and reversed as the spread became increasingly dire in many countries. Provinces and territories went into high alert in mid-March, as the WHO formally declared a global pandemic, with states of emergencies declared across Canada and different regions implementing various levels of restrictions on social gathering sizes. Schools closed across the country, along with daycares, and non-essential businesses. Events and activities involving large groups of people were cancelled as the public was advised to practice physical distancing. At the same time, Canadians were advised to avoid all non-essential travel outside the country indefinitely, with Canadians returning from abroad asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Anecdotally, some returning passengers noted that “screening” measures at airports still appeared minimal given the circumstances, with federal officials saying there was no need for additional measures like recording temperatures of travellers. As the tally of cases grew in Canada, it became increasingly clear that many of the cases were linked to the United States. The level of movement between the two countries made containment impossible without drastic measures. By midnight on March 18, Canadian borders were closed to all but Canadians, their families, residents, and Americans, with international flights redirected to airports in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. On March 20, the 8,891-kilometre-long U.S.-Canada border also closed to non-essential travel and remains closed. The Quarantine Act was invoked on March 25 and all in-bound travellers were required to self-isolate for two weeks. As infections rose in Canada, long-term care homes, especially in Ontario and Quebec, suffered a disproportionately devastating impact, with more than 80 per cent of the total deaths in Canada attributable to outbreaks at hundreds of these facilities. The territories and East Coast provinces have remained mostly unscathed throughout the pandemic so far, with very few cases and deaths -- if any -- reported in these jurisdictions compared to the rest of the country. Atlantic provinces also formed their own travel “bubble” and tightened provincial borders with measures that limited travellers into the region. The rest of the country began turning a corner in early May, some three-and-a-half months after its first case was identified. The number of new infections fell and the daily death toll dropped as low as the single digits from a peak of 177, prompting provinces to slowly reopen again. By mid-July, however, Western Canadian provinces were seeing the number of new cases rise again. Regions like Ontario and Quebec began seeing the curve bend upwards by mid-August. As tens of thousands of children returned to in-class schooling, the daily number of new cases relentlessly climbed into the new year. The arrival of variants of concern raised considerable alarm among medical experts. By early April 2021, ICU admissions for COVID-19 in the province surpassed 500, a record, with doctors noticing that patients were getting younger and sicker faster. In B.C., an outbreak involving the P.1 variant reportedly made the province the largest hotspot for that mutation outside Brazil. The incredible speed with which vaccines were developed marks a turning point for the pandemic. To ensure Canadians had ready access to promising vaccine candidates, Canada invested over $1 billion, securing contracts that could deliver more than 400 million doses, or enough to vaccinate the entire population several times over. Expectations were high for the vaccine campaign, which kicked-off earlier than planned. But a lack of domestic manufacturing capacity combined with delivery delays and a vaccination schedule some criticized as not aggressive enough meant less than 4 percent of the population had been inoculated by the beginning of March, two months into the rollout. More than 15 percent of the U.S., 30 percent of the U.K. and 50 percent of Israel had received at least one dose by then, drawing further attention to the importance of being able to manufacture the vaccines domestically. Following some adjustments including delaying the second shot and the arrival of new vaccine shipments, the campaign picked up significant speed in March. Now Ottawa hopes all eligible Canadians will have their first shot before Canada Day. But how the battle between the vaccines and the variants will play out remains to be seen.

Documents reveal glimpse into Canada’s early COVID-19 plans This is how each province is handling the pandemic Tracking every case of COVID-19 in Canada GERMANY (TOP) The country has been hit hard by COVID-19, but received attention early in the pandemic due to its low mortality rate compared to other European countries at the time. New infections also rose slower in Germany compared to its European counterparts for much of the year. All that changed during the second wave that hit European countries in the fall and stretched through the winter, leaving many asking what happened to the once-role model? Between early October 2020 and early April 2021, cases in Germany soared to 2.94 million from around 300,000. Deaths soared to about 77,000 from 9,500 over the same six-month period. Early during the outbreak, the government considered the new disease a ""very low threat"" and far less dangerous than SARS, making travel warnings unnecessary. But less than a week later, on Jan. 27, health officials confirmed the country's first case of the novel coronavirus. Two days after, Lufthansa, Germany’s flagship airline, suspended all flights to China. According to media reports, face masks were quickly sold out, and measures to screen travellers from high-risk regions of China were placed at Frankfurt Airport, which has no direct flights to and from Wuhan. In mid-February, the German health minister rejected temperature screenings for inbound travellers and believed travel restrictions between China should be a decision made across Europe, rather than done unilaterally by individual countries. Towards the end of the month, however, travellers arriving from China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy were required to provide more information for contact tracing purposes, as were rail passengers, amid stricter land border patrols. Some regions of Germany began closing schools and other public places by late February, while some sporting events were suspended or cancelled altogether. Organizers of the world’s largest travel trade fair cancelled the event a week before launch. By early March, the government officially recommended that German states ban events involving more than 1,000 people. Berlin closed its theatres, concert halls and opera houses just before the WHO formally declared a pandemic. Just two days before the pandemic declaration, two seniors became the first COVID-19 deaths in Germany. Infections were doubling at this point. In the days that followed the pandemic declaration, parts of Germany launched drive-through COVID-19 testing, land borders surrounding the country were fully closed, while 14 out of 16 German states closed its schools and kindergartens. The government recommended against all non-essential domestic and foreign travel; flights from Iran and China were also suspended. The European Union also agreed on an immediate travel ban into Europe for all non-EU citizens, while Germany expanded its list to include citizens from Italy, Spain, and other EU countries. Many of these changes were a reversal of the German health minister’s position in early March discouraging border closures. A national curfew was enacted on March 22, which allowed people to leave their home only to work, buy groceries, etc. Gatherings were limited to no more than two people from different households, while physical distancing was required. Restaurants and other services closed on April 2. By early April, Germany’s mortality rate stood at less than 1.5 per cent while Italy’s stood at around 12 per cent. Spain, France and Britain were roughly 9 to 10 per cent. Earlier during the pandemic, the testing rate for the latter three countries was also a fraction of Germany's, with some media reports indicating that Germany was able to ramp up extensive testing more quickly and earlier. Germany also has more than double the number of hospital beds in Italy and Spain, according to OECD data, and a number of media reports cited Germany's ""expensive and extensive"" public health care system as a key reason for the lower mortality rate. Like many other countries, however, there was ongoing concern over a shortage of masks and other protective equipment during the height of the country’s outbreak. Germany's outbreak also began mostly among young and healthy skiers who caught the virus at European ski resorts and the overall average age of infected patients early in the pandemic was more than a decade younger than its neighbouring countries. At first, the government appeared reluctant to impose physical distancing measures, travel restrictions, school and border closures, even as it advised against unnecessary travel and asked recent travellers from high-risk destinations to stay home. The country began easing restrictions in May, with an “emergency brake” set-up for restrictions to be reinstituted locally if infections climbed above a threshold of 50 per 100,000 residents. The outbreak in the first wave peaked in early April 2020, when it was reporting more than 6,000 new cases a day. Despite its early successes, the number of infections more than tripled to over one million between late-September and late-November. Cases reached 2 million by mid-January 2021. Daily infections topped more than 49,000 at one point, while the number of deaths, which had remained relatively flat throughout the summer and early fall, hit a high of 1,734 one day near mid-January. The government imposed a hard lockdown in mid-December that was extended several times. As the B.1.1.7 variant first discovered in the UK spread rapidly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the country was “in a new pandemic”. But hampering the country’s battle has been its slow vaccine rollout -- Germany sits outside the top 50 in the percentage of residents who have received the first dose. Meanwhile, the country’s overall number of infections and cumulative deaths have now reached the top 10 globally. INDIA (TOP) The world’s second most populous country is shattering COVID-19 records, reporting one of the highest numbers of total reported cases and deaths in the world. It is second only to the U.S. for the worst infection record and fourth behind U.S., Brazil, and Mexico in deaths. Along with the U.S., it is also only the second country to have recorded more than 300,000 new cases in a single day. India is currently experiencing its worst surge -- charted by a shocking near-vertical line upwards -- with the 7-day average in new cases skyrocketing in just over one month, from about 15,500 reported cases at the beginning of March 2021, to more than 100,000. But that exponential surge reached more than 265,000 just two weeks later, exceeding the worst 7-day average experienced in the U.S. India’s deaths since the beginning of April are also charting a similarly grim steep upward trajectory. Even with these dire numbers, many believe the figures are still undercounted. As a major vaccine manufacturer, India’s vaccination campaign began in mid-January, with health authorities administering 2.7 million doses daily, according to the Associated Press. Our World In Data showed well over 100 million doses had been given by mid-April. But with less than 10 per cent of the population receiving their first shot in a country of nearly 1.4 billion, and at a time when infections appear to be spreading exponentially with no signs of slowing down, the situation in India has become extremely dire: the country’s fragile health care system -- a concern since the earliest days of the pandemic -- is grappling with shortages of hospital beds, staffing, medicine, and oxygen, with demand far exceeding supply. Many are dying waiting for an open bed or even for a way to get to a hospital, the Associated Press reported. There was significant worry from the start that COVID-19 could be devastating for India. The concerns were not misplaced, with India recording 10,000 documented deaths by mid-June 2020, a million recorded infections by mid-July, and 5 million cases within two months. A hundred thousand had died by the beginning of October 2020. But these numbers paled in comparison to what was to come. By mid-April, 2021, nearly 14.3 million Indians had been infected and more than 174,300 were dead. Despite the high risk of spread due to its dense population, testing was extremely limited in the beginning. Some of the country’s earliest actions in January and February included evacuating its citizens from China (and later from other parts of the world like Iran, Italy and the U.K.), issuing a travel warning for China, and quarantining travellers returning from China. In early March, 2020, compulsory screening was required for international passengers coming from a number of countries, with travel restrictions imposed for Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran. At the same time, a growing number of schools across the country began closing. As transmissions increased from returning travellers, strong travel advisories and inbound quarantine requirements were significantly expanded for China, Italy, South Korea, Iran, Japan, France, Spain, and Germany. Days after the WHO began to formally call the global crisis a pandemic, India closed its international land borders, which was followed by a ban on travellers-- including Indian passport holders -- coming from hotspots. In the early days, there were reports of outbreaks in slums, where people live in extreme poverty and crowded conditions. A sudden and strict lockdown imposed across the entire country on March 24, 2020 sparked a mass exodus of migrant labourers back to their home villages, spurring worries of possible outbreaks in regions poorly equipped to handle a health-care crisis. According to the OECD, India has just 0.5 hospital beds for every 1,000 people, for example. China, by comparison, has 4.3 beds. Overall, India spends less on its health care system relative to its gross domestic product compared to other major economies, according to the Associated Press. Despite these and other concerns, the number of reported deaths per capita and case fatality rate for India sat far below many other countries during the first wave. But the data had been called “sparse, and sporadic”, with consensus being that cases and deaths were undercounted during the first wave. A study published in late-July 2020, for example, suggested that more than half of the slum residents in Mumbai may have been infected, with 57 per cent of samples collected testing positive for antibodies. By mid-April 2020, masks were mandatory across India. The country was reopening by early June amid concerns over the massive economic costs of staying closed, and despite worries that the move was too risky and too soon. Cases continued to climb throughout the summer, with cases peaking at over 97,000 at one point in September, 2020. As infections finally began declining in the fall, it was widely believed the worst was over. This was reinforced by a government COVID-19 panel that said the pandemic could be controlled by February 2021, based on modelling projections presented in October, 2020. With cases dropping for months after, some experts contend the government wasted an opportunity to beef up the country’s health system before the second wave hit. The B.1.617 variant was first detected in early October 2020, according to the GISAID global database. This variant has 13 mutations, and has been inaccurately described as a “double mutant” due to two particular mutations. While this variant appears to be the main one found in India, scientists have yet to definitively confirm it is the main cause behind the massive surge in infections in spring 2021, particularly with many other factors at play, including the government’s decision to not pause Hindu religious festivals or elections. With migrant workers trying to escape the city and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruling out a nationwide lockdown, favouring targeted lockdowns instead, there is no sign the grim situation will change anytime soon in India. ITALY (TOP) Italy suspended its air connections from Wuhan on Jan. 23, and all flights to and from China a week later, on Jan. 31. They were the third country after the Czech Republic and Greece to no longer receive and process visa applications in China. In addition, the country declared a state of emergency. Despite some of these early measures, leaders, including the president, downplayed the outbreak in the early days, resulting in initial complacency. A few short weeks later, on Feb. 22, 11 municipalities in Northern Italy were placed under quarantine, locking down more than 50,000 people, with penalties including fines and prison for violation. Schools and universities closed within the affected areas, while public events, religious services, train service to affected areas, sporting events, carnivals– including the Carnival of Venice–were all cancelled or suspended. Two days later, 500 police officers were added to patrol the regions under quarantine. Key buildings, such as the Palazzo Madama, implemented thermal scanners for everyone entering the premises. Despite these measures, by March, Italy became the centre of the worst outbreak outside of China at the time, with deaths at one point doubling every few days. Within two short weeks, daily cases spiked to a high of more than 6,500 and daily death tolls hit as high as 971. The country instituted an unprecedented lockdown, considered by many to be the most drastic response outside China at the time. Schools and universities were shut down nation-wide on March 4, and quarantine measures were expanded to all of Lombardy and more than a dozen other northern provinces by March 8, putting 16 million people under lockdown. In addition, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the closure of all commercial businesses, museums, entertainment venues, etc. across Italy. The next day, the entire country of 60 million people was put under quarantine, and all sporting events within the country were cancelled. All non-essential commercial activities were prohibited, on March 11, including bars and restaurants. With the number of daily new cases and deaths soaring, the Italian government enlisted military help to enforce lockdown on March 19. Parks and playgrounds closed the next day, along with other additional restrictions meant to limit movement throughout the country. All non-essential businesses and factories closed on March 21. In March, Italy became the centre of the worst outbreak outside of China at the time, with deaths at one point doubling every few days. Within two short weeks, daily cases spiked to a high of more than 6,500 and daily death tolls hit as high as 971. The country instituted an unprecedented lockdown, considered by many to be the most drastic response outside China at the time. The elderly were hit especially hard, a pattern that would be repeated later in places like Canada. The percentage of Italy’s population over 65 is the second highest in the world, second only to Japan, according to the world bank. “Dozens” were dying in nursing homes in the worst-affected areas, but were untested due to strict testing rules, according to media reports. Testing ramped up slowly early in the pandemic, with the eligibility criteria varying between jurisdictions. In the small town of Vo, mass testing was said to help quickly contain the spread. Leaders, including the president, downplayed the outbreak in the early days, resulting in initial complacency. While the country’s first case was identified in mid-February, a national waste water study in June found the virus was detected in samples collected in December, indicating that when doctors first reported cases in China, the virus was already present in Italy too. Italy’s mortality in March was 41,329, roughly double that of the previous five years, according to a report published in July. This included 5,000 deaths not included in the toll attributed to COVID-19, suggesting how undercounted initial numbers likely were. Italy turned a corner in April and by June, was steadily reporting roughly 200 to 300 new cases a day, with deaths generally falling to under 20 a day. The country began significantly easing restrictions in mid-May and by late July, also reopened its borders to tourists from more than two dozen countries. Since restrictions eased over the summer, Italy began experiencing an uptick in new cases toward the end of August, but with a seven-day average of less than three daily new cases per 100,000 throughout September, the country is fairing significantly better than its European counterparts including Spain, which peaked at more than 24 cases per 100,000 over a seven-day average, and France at more than 18 cases per 100,000. NEW ZEALAND (TOP) New Zealand launched a national coordination centre on Jan. 28 to respond to the outbreak, a month before reporting its first case. Any traveller who left from China or transited through the country was barred from entering New Zealand as of Feb. 3, with only citizens and permanent residents allowed; a travel advisory for all of mainland China was raised to ""do not travel"". Days later, returning travellers coming from or transiting through China were advised to also self-isolate for 14 days. The first case for New Zealand was detected on Feb. 28, in a citizen who had just returned from Iran. That same day, additional travel restrictions were implemented and included inbound travellers from Iran. By the end of February, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand were all added to the list of countries and regions of concern. On March 14, after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, New Zealand required that all travellers returning were required to self-isolate for 14 days, including citizens. Non-citizens who did not comply with the self-isolation rules were required to leave the country after the quarantine period was over. New Zealanders were urged to return home. Indoor events with more than 100 people were prohibited (excluding work, schools, public transit) starting March 19 and borders closed to all but citizens and residents. A day later, public facilities such as libraries, community centres, museums also shuttered in major cities. Schools across the country closed on March 23 as the number of cases in the country jumped from 66 to 102. The national alert level was also raised to 4, triggering a highly restrictive, four-week nationwide lockdown. Bars, restaurants and other non-essential services were ordered to close within two days. New Zealand, which reported its first case roughly a month after Europe and North America, may have benefited from seeing how its counterparts in Europe and North America fared and not being a landlocked country. It is notable how quickly the country moved to mitigate the spread by closing its borders even when only a handful of cases were reported. At its peak, New Zealand reported just 95 new cases. By mid-May, all lockdown measures had been lifted except size limits on social gatherings and physical distancing. Following the recovery of its final active case of COVID-19 at the time, all restrictions except for border closures were lifted by June 9. After more than three weeks without a new case, however, two travellers who had arrived from Britain tested positive in mid-June, prompting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to put the military in charge of its border quarantine operations. For 102 days, there was no community spread reported in the country, maintaining between zero to less than five new cases a day. The number of cases ticked higher mid-August, though still remained under 20 new cases per day. Overall, the country has only suffered a handful of deaths. Following the mid-August uptick, a lockdown in Aucklandwas extended for another two-weeks and lifted by the end of the month, though gathering limits remain in place. New Zealand borders also remain closed, with the country mainly under physical distancing rules. UNITED STATES (TOP) The United States experienced multiple waves since the start of the pandemic, each one more critical than the last, culminating in the worst COVID-19 situation in the world at the time. After a brief period of relative stability in the fall of 2020, when the daily average in new cases hovered around 41,000, new infections began steadily climbing again through to the end of the year, peaking at more than 300,000 in one day at the beginning of 2021. By early December 2020 more Americans were also dying of COVID-19 in a single day than were killed in the 9/11 attacks. The daily death toll only grew over the following weeks -- reaching a high of 4,475 in one day on Jan. 12, 2021. More than 32 million Americans have been infected with COVID-19; more than half a million have died so far. A sluggish initial government response, combined with policies that harmed the most vulnerable groups -- Indigenous, Black Americans, and others -- and a “bloated, inefficient” health-care system helped pave the way to record cases and deaths, the Atlantic magazine wrote. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was reportedly sidelined by former president Donald Trump for much of 2020. A divisive and partisan election year, an attempt to keep the economy as open as possible, opposing ideologies on individual rights, masking, public health protocols like gatherings, an online environment that sowed misinformation, and even questions about the legitimacy of the pandemic all fed into a disastrous and deadly recipe that saw every state hit by varying levels of “uncontrolled spread”. The first known case of COVID-19 was diagnosed on Jan. 21, 2020 in Washington State. Toward the end of the month, a White House Coronavirus Task Force was established to “monitor, prevent, contain, and mitigate” the pandemic’s spread. Two days later, on Jan. 31, the government declared a public health emergency and restrictions were placed on travellers arriving from China. A “do not travel” advisory was issued for China on Feb. 2. On Feb. 26, 2020 the CDC warned Americans to prepare for an outbreak as the first evidence of community spread in the U.S. appeared involving a case in California with an unknown origin. By the end of the month, Washington state declared a state of emergency. Over the course of the next week or so, Florida, New York and other states declared a public health emergency as well. Testing in the United States was severely hampered in the first several weeks according to medical journal articles and numerous media reports. Screening was “rationed” because only CDC – not public health or hospital labs – could run the tests initially, with a strict criteria for testing only those with known exposure. State labs also ran into verification problems with the CDC test kits, with results coming back “inconclusive or invalid due to failure of the negative control”. Under pressure by state labs to expand testing capacity, tests developed by hospitals and other labs were finally permitted by the FDA at the end of February. On March 3, testing restrictions were also officially lifted, allowing medical professionals the discretion to determine whether a patient needed to be tested. But even when the testing criteria was loosened and testing capacity ramped up, the demand far exceeded availability. Two-and-a-half weeks after a pandemic was declared, the U.S. was still only conducting 2,250 tests per million, two-thirds of what South Korea was able to accomplish three weeks earlier, and despite regulations around testing that were loosened four weeks earlier, according to the Washington Post. Compounding the regulatory and technical problems with testing was the varying political response from all levels of government, with cities and states and the White House reacting with skepticism to urgency to conflict over the situation, despite warnings. Even prior to the outbreak in China, government reports and pandemic prep exercises as late as last year were not taken seriously. The world’s richest country “squandered” an entire month, a New York Times investigation said. The NBA became the first major sports league to suspend games as WHO formally declared a pandemic on March 11, marking a major shift in tone and the sense of urgency around the pandemic. The following day, the CDC recommended against non-essential travel to a number of countries and regions including China, most of Europe, and Iran. Two days later, the U.S. declared a national emergency, while travel restrictions were also imposed for incoming visitors from Europe and elsewhere. Additional measures were implemented over the coming days: flights from restricted countries were required to land at designated airports with enhanced screening; the White House advised against gatherings of more than 10 people; a global “do not travel” advisory was issued for Americans; further travel restrictions were imposed on foreign nationals who had visited Europe within the previous two weeks; and further quarantine and monitoring measures are added to earlier travel restrictions. On March 20, 2020, U.S. and Canada closed its international borders -- the longest in the world -- to all non-essential travel between the two countries, a restriction that still remains in effect. The next day, governors in NY, California, and other large states ordered most businesses to close and for people to stay indoors, with varying exceptions. Within days, more than a dozen other states impose lockdown orders. New York became the centre of the U.S. outbreak by late March, with more confirmed cases than any other country outside the U.S., according to one media report. Hospitals, health care workers, and the 911 emergency response system were all reportedly overwhelmed, with one doctor describing the situation at his hospital as “apocalyptic”. By mid-April, all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. were under a disaster declaration as the number of COVID-related deaths in the U.S. crossed the 20,000 mark and surpassed Italy, becoming the highest in the world. Many parts of the country issued stay-at-home orders, cancelled mass-gatherings like sporting and music events, and closed schools. While the total number of cases still surged from about half a million to two million over the following two months and deaths soared past 100,000, the restrictions helped cap the rise in daily new infections and deaths during that period, with the curve marginally sloping downward. But as states began reopening, that modest dip in new infections made a dramatic upward reversal that eclipsed what unfolded between March and April. The explosion of cases nearly doubled in just over a month, hitting Arizona, Florida and Texas the hardest. Meanwhile, leadership at all levels of government continued to be unco-ordinated, with mayors clashing with state governors over measures including wearing face masks, and reopenings of businesses and schools. Some Americans protested the restrictions amid a rampant problem of false information spreading around the pandemic. Testing remained contentious. As other countries gird for the possibility of a “second wave,” experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the U.S. never emerged from the first. The second surge peaked in mid to late July 2020 when cases hit more than four million. That figure doubled by mid-October to more than eight million, and doubled once more by early-mid December. While the CDC had encouraged mask-wearing in public spaces for months, it only issued a universal mask advisory in December 2020. By late January 2021, more than 25 million Americans had been infected. Even the death toll climbed relentlessly, reaching more than 200,000 by mid-September 2020, and 300,000 by mid-December. It reached 400,000 by mid-January, and the grim milestone of more than half a million dead by February 21, 2021. What dramatically helped the U.S. turn its situation around was the quick ramp-up in vaccinations beginning in early January, with infections finally declining two weeks later. By early May, the U.S. was reporting less than 40,000 new cases a day, a level not seen since last September. The average daily death toll fell as well to less than 700 -- a figure not seen since July 2020. But vaccinations slowed down significantly by late April as demand waned across almost all states. A pause in the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to blood clot concerns was a partial factor, some experts said. In a bid to incentivize those who have yet to get a vaccine, some businesses and governments began offering freebies and major “prizes” like Ohio’s plan to give away millions of dollars and full-ride scholarships through lotteries. With more than a third of the population fully vaccinated and more than 45 percent having had at least one dose, the CDC also issued new mask guidelines in May that many hope marks the ‘final stretch” of the pandemic in the U.S. Days earlier, on May 7, 2021, the agency had also formally acknowledged airborne transmissions of the virus. The new mask advisory states that fully vaccinated individuals need not wear a mask or physically distance in most places, prompting debate that the move was too soon, sent the wrong message, and relied too much on the “honour system”. SOUTH KOREA (TOP) South Korea initiated containment measures almost immediately after China reported the unknown pneumonia cases to the World Health Organization - days before the global health agency issued a press release on Jan. 5. Quarantine and screening measures were put in place for all travellers coming from Wuhan, China as health authorities beefed up national surveillance of pneumonia cases in hospitals. The first case was identified just weeks later, on Jan. 20, caught during heightened airport checks through thermal screening during entry at Incheon International Airport. That same day, the country’s infectious disease alert was raised to yellow (level 2) from blue. The public was advised to continue hand washing, practice proper cough etiquette, and mask-wearing if they had respiratory symptoms. A national hotline was launched to allow the public to report symptoms within 14 days of travel. The following day, the government issued travel recommendations and advisories for travellers to China. Inbound travellers who visited Wuhan within 14 days were asked to submit a health questionnaire and to report to health officials if a fever or respiratory symptoms developed. Health officials quickly and aggressively ramped up their testing capacity, contact tracing, tracking, and quarantine measures in a national, co-ordinated, and detailed fashion, allowing for early mass testing, long before a pandemic was declared. A high-level of transparency -- at times seen as controversial and intrusive -- allowed for real-time anonymous information to be shared with the public and used for tracking by early March. Officials were able to trace the movements of an infected patient and alert those who were in contact or nearby by taking information from GPS trackers in mobile phones, credit cards, and CCTV cameras. Infected individuals venturing outside their quarantine zone would also get a warning through a phone app. Concerned that the novel coronavirus could become a pandemic, health officials and more than 20 medical companies met on Jan. 27 to discuss the urgency of developing an effective test quickly, promising “swift regulatory approval,” according to a Reuters investigation. The first diagnostic test from a company was approved within a week, on Feb. 4, and a second company was ready by Feb. 12. The day after the meeting, the government also issued a requirement that all inbound travellers (Korean and foreign) coming from anywhere in China undergo tougher screening and quarantine measures, including a health questionnaire at the point of entry; giving false information was subject to a fine of up to US$10,000. Meanwhile, the country’s infectious disease alert was raised to a level three “orange”. Additional staff was also added to the KCDC’s national call centre on Jan. 29 to deal with the influx of calls for consultation. Additional law enforcement and health staff were also added to airport quarantine checkpoints. At the beginning of February, the country’s occupational safety and health agency announced it would provide 720,000 masks to industries and workplaces considered more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to the large number of foreign employees or visitors. These include the construction, manufacturing and service industries. Over the next few days in early February, new measures were initiated: A 14-day self-isolation requirement for anyone who came in contact with a patient who tested positive, foreigners arriving from Hubei province were barred from entering the country and a separate airport arrival hall was created for travellers coming in from China. Visitors also had to provide verified domestic contact information prior to entry for contact tracing purposes. Meanwhile, daycare centres, nursing and long-term care facilities were asked to temporarily close if anyone, including visitors, tested positive or was a contact of a positive case. Strict quarantine measures for arrivals expanded Feb. 12 to include Hong Kong and Macao. By mid-February, the number of diagnostic test kits available, which had increased dramatically from 200 to 3,000 per day, continued to ramp up towards a capacity goal of 10,000 a day -- a figure they eventually exceeded. The number of confirmed cases jumped by Feb. 20, attributed to “Patient 31” identified two days earlier. “Patient 31” had participated in a large church gathering in Daegu and was the source of a major outbreak. All citizens in the city of Daegu were asked to self-isolate for two weeks and those with symptoms had to get tested. Tens of thousands of members of the Sincheonji Church of Jesus, a main cluster and exposure point by “Patient 31”, were tested. Drive-through testing sites were established quickly, offering citizens an efficient way of getting tested while minimizing exposure to others, with results sent via text within three days. Around this time, the government also announced plans to designate certain hospitals as national infectious disease hospitals with orders to transfer all existing patients to other health-care facilities by Feb 28. South Korea’s infectious disease alert was raised to ""red"" or level 4, the highest threat level. While businesses were allowed to stay open, many places, including offices and hotels as well, checked temperatures at the door or installed thermal cameras to screen for fevers. By the end of the month, public libraries, museums, churches, and daycares in Daegu closed. The number of daily new infections peaked by the end of February before dropping sharply. By mid-March, inbound travellers (both citizens and foreigners) from Japan, Italy, Iran, and within days – the rest of Europe - had to undergo special immigration screening, including installing a self-diagnosis mobile app. Travellers were advised to minimize their movement and required to submit a daily self-check for 14 days. Authorities followed-up in person if anyone failed to comply. Government declared several cities including Daegu ""special disaster zones"" and mass testing of everyone at high-risk facilities in Daegu was conducted. Days later, the government advised South Koreans to cancel all non-urgent international travel, and like many other countries, all travellers entering Korea, regardless of citizenship, must fill a health questionnaire, provide verifiable contact information, and install the self-diagnosis mobile app. Travellers arriving from Europe were automatically tested. By March 25, all travellers arriving from the U.S. were also tested at the airport. Between April 3 and July 25, South Korea, with a population of roughly 52 million, reported less than 100 new cases daily. Since the first case was identified, daily deaths have yet to exceed the single digits. Nightlife establishments in Seoul closed in May after a number of cases were linked to an infected individual who visited nearly half a dozen nightclubs in one evening. South Korea experienced another spike in August, with the number of new cases peaking at 441 in one day after the Sarang Jeil Church became the focus of another mass outbreak amid accusations the pastor flouted quarantine rules and was obstructing contact tracing efforts. An anti-government protest attended by thousands of people including the pastor also raised concerns of further spread. But the seven-day average number of new cases fell below 100 by late September after the public was urged to limit their movements amid the rising numbers. South Korea never enacted strict nationwide lockdown measures like many other countries and its economy never really shut down, though gathering restrictions were placed for high-risk locations like churches, entertainment and sports facilities, and schools remained closed for much longer. Infected people are isolated and those who come in contact with them are put into quarantine. The public was also encouraged to practise physical distancing and stay home as much as possible, aside from work and buying essentials, in the early days of the pandemic and during case spikes like the one in August. But with case numbers relatively low, daily life has been more normal than many other parts of the world. Much of the country otherwise operated and continues to operate under relatively minimal restrictions, though mask-wearing is extremely common everywhere.

The estimated cost of the 44th federal election is $610 million, about $108 million more than the $502.4-million price tag for the 2019 election. Why is it so expensive? Blame it on COVID-19 and a growing population. “The main thing is COVID-19,” Lars Osberg, an economics professor at Dalhousie University, told CTV’s Your Morning on Wednesday. “When you have an election in COVID times, you have to have more people around the polls, you have to have Plexiglas everywhere, you have to have all the COVID protocols.” And that simply adds up. About $50 million of the new expenses this year will go to pandemic protocols and another $50 million will be due to population growth, Elections Canada said. There are about 38.1 million people living in the country now, compared with about 37.4 million in 2019. “The last election cost Canadians about $18.35 per registered voter,” Osberg said. “And the population has increased, so it’s kind of normal that the expenses of an election increase.” Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign The bulk of the election costs in the last federal vote -- $438 million -- went toward preparing for and running the actual event. It covered recruiting and training more than 200,000 election workers, printing ballots and lists of electors, leasing local offices and about 18,000 polling places, communications campaigns, IT equipment and shipping election materials. In 2019, all of this accounted for 87.25 per cent of the total election cost. The remaining $64.4 million went toward reimbursing parties and candidates. To be eligible for partial reimbursement of election expenses, candidates must be elected or obtain at least 10 per cent of the valid votes cast in their electoral district. “There are a lot of fine details that go into running an election,” Osberg said. And holding an election during the pandemic means accommodating for the times. Although the 250,000 polling workers won’t be required to be fully vaccinated, the polling stations will be “highly controlled,” Chief Electoral Officer Stephane Perrault said in a press conference on Aug. 18. “[Canadians] can expect to see essentially the kind of measures that they now have been seeing for the last 18 months. So, we will have people in charge of ensuring that the place is clean, that the electors are properly distanced. They will see for example these physical transparent barriers that will separate the poll workers,” said Perrault. Masks will be distributed, hand sanitizer enforced, and disposable pencils required, he added. According to recent surveys, the number of Canadians interested in casting a ballot by mail could be between two million and three million, compared with about 50,000 during the 2019 election. Elections Canada is increasing its capacity to process mail-in ballots and it may take longer to count them. Depending on how the vote goes, it could take up to five additional days after the election for the final results to come in for Canada’s most expensive federal election to date.

On the eve of the Labour Day weekend, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam took aim at young adults, describing an ""urgent need"" for more people between the ages of 18 and 39 to get vaccinated in order to prevent a rapid worsening of Canada's COVID-19 situation. ""The moment you get people back indoors … we will see accelerations,"" she said Friday at a press conference. Data released by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) shows that 74 per cent of those between the ages of 18 and 29 and 77 per cent of those in their 30s have been fully vaccinated, versus 82 per cent of those in their 40s and even higher percentages of older age groups. In addition, Tam said, those younger adults ""continue to have the highest rates of infection,"" in part because they are more likely to have close contact with people outside their household for work-related or recreational reasons. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox There is also a regional disparity in vaccination rates. While 84 per cent of eligible vaccine recipients across Canada have received two doses, the rate is only 78 per cent in Alberta and 76 per cent in Saskatchewan. From mid-July to mid-August, Tam said, the COVID-19 infection rate was 12 times higher among the unvaccinated than the vaccinated, and the hospitalization rate was 36 times higher. PHAC estimates that 5.2 million eligible Canadians have not yet received any COVID-19 vaccination, while another 2.5 million are only considered partially vaccinated. ""The bottom line is that millions of people across Canada remain unvaccinated and at high risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness outcomes,"" Tam said. A BLEAK FALL FORECAST Tam also called on all Canadians to limit their contacts as summer comes to a close, sending many back to schools and workplaces. ""Right now is not the time to gather in huge numbers with people that are not in your household, without taking significant layers of protection,"" she said. However, the chief doctor repeatedly emphasized that the country still has a ""window of opportunity"" to avoid skyrocketing case counts and an overwhelmed health-care system later this month, suggesting that renewed provincial restrictions could have an impact. ""Of course we can do something about a resurgence, and I've seen provinces do that,"" she said. The PHAC modelling data suggests that if public health measures are able to reduce the level of transmission across the country by 25 per cent, the fourth wave of the pandemic could soon plateau at a lower daily infection rate than the peaks of the second and third waves. Source: Public Health Agency of Canada PHAC reports that Canada is experiencing ""ongoing rapid acceleration"" of COVID-19 activity, including in cases causing severe illness. Tam said that the number of new hospitalizations related to COVID-19 in Canada has more than doubled since the last modelling was released on July 30, and is now above 1,200 per day. She attributed the increase in virus activity to slow vaccine uptake and an ""earlier than expected reopening"" in some parts of the country. There is not yet any indication that the fourth wave is resulting in an increase in deaths among COVID-19 patients, the data shows. Source: Public Health Agency of Canada FIRST BRIEFING SINCE ELECTION CALLED Friday was the first time Tam or other PHAC officials directly addressed reporters since the federal election was called in mid-August. Such press conferences had been a regular occurrence prior to the election. The modelling was initially slated to be released without a press conference, in what would have been a departure from PHAC's usual practice. The agency reversed course on that decision last week, amid questions about changing communications strategy during the federal election. Asked about the reversal, Tam said that she had been communicating with the public during the election campaign through written press releases and her social media accounts, and hinted that there will be more press conferences to come. ""Given where the epidemic is heading, I expect to be providing regular briefings to all of you,"" she said.

The parties were required to submit their final list of candidate nominations to Elections Canada by the Aug. 30 deadline – 21 days before election day. According to Equal Voice, a not-for-profit organization that tracks gender diversity in Canadian politics, women and gender-diverse candidates account for 43 per cent of all nominees across the five major parties – a slight increase from the 42 per cent total in the 2019 federal election. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign Equal Voice’s Executive Director Eleanor Fast said they were worried the disproportionate effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on women in many areas of the country would affect their participation in the election. “So, for that reason, we are happy to see the numbers, basically at the same levels of 2019, although a little bit better, which is always the right direction to go in,” she told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Thursday. Fast said they were also concerned there would be fewer female candidates during this election because research has shown that women are more likely to participate when there is a fixed election date. In light of those concerns, Fast said they are “reasonably happy” with the percentage of female and gender-diverse candidates running in this election. She added that they’re always watching to see if women and gender-diverse candidates are being nominated in winnable ridings. “That's always a big concern because it's all very well being able to say a certain percentage of your candidates are women or gender-diverse people, but are you supporting them adequately and are they going to get elected on election night?” she said. For example, during the 2019 election, Fast said 42 per cent of candidates were women or gender-diverse people, but only 29 per cent of all elected MPs were women. “We hope that that doesn't play out again this time,” she said. Digging into the numbers, the NDP has the highest percentage of women or gender diverse candidates on its list with 52 per cent, or 175 candidates – a slight increase from 2019 when it had 49 per cent. The Bloc Quebecois has the second-highest percentage of women candidates with 47 per cent, or 37 of their 78 candidates, running in Quebec. That number is up from 45 per cent in 2019. As of Thursday morning, the Green Party isn't running a full slate of candidates with 252 people on its list. Of those, 112 (44 per cent) are women or gender-diverse candidates. Fast said that number could change in the coming days, however, and they will continue to track the party’s list of candidates. The Liberals’ list includes 147, or 43 per cent, women candidates this year – an increase from 39 per cent in 2019. Finally, the Conservatives have also increased their number of female candidates this year with 111 nominees, or 33 per cent – up slightly from 32 per cent in 2019. In total, Equal Voice tallied 582 women or gender diverse candidates running in this year’s federal election. During the last election, 98 women were elected, or 29 per cent of the total elected representatives in Parliament. Before Parliament was dissolved in August, there were 100 female MPs in the House of Commons, which placed Canada in 55th place in the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s (IPU) global rankings of women in national parliaments. This election, Equal Voice said they’re hoping Canadians will elect more than 136 women or gender diverse candidates on Sept. 20 so they can achieve 40 per cent gender parity in the House of Commons. “To get to 40 per cent of MPs being women, and that would mean 136 women or gender-diverse people being elected,” Fast said. “Our hope would be to get to 136 in this election, obviously, that’s an ambitious aim, a big jump, but that's what we will be looking for on election night.” RELATED IMAGES view larger image The percentage of female or gender-diverse candidates running for each of the main five federal parties is shown in this graph.

On Tuesday, Statistics Canada reported that the economy contracted at an annualized rate of 1.1 per cent between April and June – the first quarterly contraction since the first COVID-19 wave lockdowns in 2020. To make matters worse, the agency also estimated another drop in real gross domestic product in July. “The news yesterday that the economy had shrank would not be good for any incumbent government,” Nanos said on Wednesday’s edition of CTV's Trend Line podcast. “The last thing that you want is for the numbers to come out and to suggest that the economy is shrinking.” Nanos said the Liberals called the election when they did because they were hoping to capitalize on good will from the Canadian public for their handling of the pandemic and the supply of COVID-19 vaccines they procured while getting ahead of future concerns about the economy related to the pandemic. “This GDP number is bad for the Liberals,” he said. “It undermines one of the key pillars that they were hoping would be in place.” This latest news also won’t help to restore Canadians’ faith in the economy, according to Nanos, who said the population is already feeling “grumpy” about it. He said the latest weekly Bloomberg-Nanos tracking on consumer confidence shows that. According to the data, 37 per cent of Canadians believe the economy will get stronger (down seven percentage points from four weeks earlier), while 30 per cent believe the economy will get weaker, and about 20 per cent believe there will be no change. “The trend in terms of consumer confidence has been dropping over the last couple of weeks and couple that with a drop or shrinking of the economy and the GDP, it is basically a one-two punch in terms of creating negativity, anxiety and concern among Canadians when it comes to the economy,” Nanos said. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign And while the shrinking economy spells trouble for the Liberals, Nanos said the Conservatives won’t fare much better thanks to their dependence on economic growth in their platform. According to the plan, the Conservatives would be able to balance the budget without any cuts within 10 years. However, the plan hinges on the assumption that there will be an annual GDP growth of roughly three per cent, which some economists believe is unrealistic, Nanos said. “These GDP numbers don’t help [Conservative Leader] Erin O’Toole because if the economy is shrinking, and your fiscal plan is based on the economy growing, it’s hard to reconcile those two things, at least for average voters,” Nanos said. O’Toole will need to defend his platform in order to maintain the “mini advantage” he has over Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in Nanos Research’s latest nightly tracking conducted for CTV News and the Globe and Mail, which was released on Wednesday morning. According to the data, the Conservatives are leading with 33.7 per cent support, followed by the Liberals with 31 per cent, and the NDP with 20.3 per cent. The other parties trail significantly behind with the Bloc Quebecois at 6.8 per cent, the People’s Party of Canada at 4.1 per cent, and the Greens at 3.5 per cent. In terms of who Canadians prefer for their next prime minister, Trudeau has a slight lead with 29.2 per cent support, followed by O’Toole with 28.4 per cent, and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh at 19.2 per cent. PPC Leader Maxime Bernier has 4.9 per cent support, just ahead of BQ Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, and Green Leader Annamie Paul. ‘IT’S HOUSING, STUPID’ The economy, and more specifically housing affordability, is also a main topic of concern for Canadians living in the vote-rich Greater Toronto Area, Nanos said. According to polling data commissioned by CTV News and CP24 that was released on Tuesday, housing is the number one priority for voters living in Toronto and the surrounding area and one that all parties will have to address if they want to win votes there. “More than four out of every 10 residents in the GTA unprompted, which means when they could say whatever they wanted, identify housing as their as their top concern,” Nanos said. “What was it that one American strategist said, ‘It's the economy, stupid’?” Nanos said. “That's probably what GTA residents want to say to any politician from any stripe, ‘It's housing, stupid.’” And although Toronto and the GTA are traditionally a Liberal stronghold, Nanos said it was interesting that when residents were asked who best understands the issues in their area, it was a three-way tie between Trudeau, O’Toole, and Singh. “That means that there's also opportunity not just for Erin O'Toole, but for Jagmeet Singh. He's got a good brand. His brand is exceptionally strong among under 35s in the in the GTA and if he can get young people to get out and vote, it can be a bit of a game changer for him,” he said. NANOS’ METHODOLOGY A national random telephone survey (land- and cellular-line sample using live agents) of 1,200 Canadians is conducted by Nanos Research throughout the campaign over a three-day period. Each evening a new group of 400 eligible voters are interviewed. The daily tracking figures are based on a three-day rolling sample comprising 1,200 interviews. To update the tracking a new day of interviewing Is added and the oldest day dropped. The margin of error for a survey of 1,200 respondents is ± 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The respondent sample is stratified geographically and by gender. The data may be weighted by age according to data from the 2016 Canadian Census administered by Statistics Canada.

Trudeau unveiled the Canada Mental Health Transfer that would deliver permanent funding to participating provinces and territories to create more “high-quality, accessible, and free” services with an initial investment of $4.5 billion over five years. “This funding, and this new transfer will mean everything from shorter wait times to more mental health professionals on the job,” said Trudeau, speaking in the Ottawa suburb of Kanata. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign The Liberals are also pledging $500 million over four years to introduce a student-focused mental health fund to decrease wait times by hiring up to 1,200 new mental health care counsellors at post-secondary institutions. Ten per cent annually will go to Indigenous-governed and operated schools. “If you’ve been in crisis and faced a waitlist, if you’re a student struggling to pay both rent and a therapist, you know there’s a lot of work still do to,” said Trudeau. “Mental health should be a priority even within our health-care system.” Similar to the Conservatives, they’re committing to implement a national three-digit mental health crisis and suicide prevention hotline. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is in the process of holding public consultations on the advantages and challenges associated with the implementation of a singular hotline after Parliament green-lighted a Conservative-backed motion to consolidate regional numbers. CONSERVATIVES Taking action on Canada’s mental health crisis – heightened throughout the duration of the pandemic – is a key pillar of the Conservative platform. They, too, plan to establish an arrangement with the provinces and territories whereby a portion of the Canada Health Transfer goes directly towards improving access to mental health services. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign 2021 platform guide: Where do the parties stand? The party’s platform states that that they will “encourage” employers to add mental health coverage to employee benefit plans by offering a 25 per cent tax credit for the cost of mental health coverage for the first three years. Additionally, they’ll create a $150 million grant program over three years for non-profits and charities delivering mental health and wellness programming. Meanwhile the Liberals, if re-elected, will aim to include mental health as a “specific element” of occupational health and safety under the Canada Labour Code, and require federally-regulated employers to take preventative steps to address workplace stress and injury. NEW DEMOCRATS The NDP have promised more broadly to include some currently privatized mental health services under the umbrella of Canada’s public system. “As a first step, a New Democrat government would bring in mental health care for uninsured Canadians – ensuring that people with no coverage for mental health services could gain access to these supports without worrying about the cost,” their platform reads. The party also notes that their proposed pharmacare plan would help alleviate steep medication costs. They’d also like to establish a “national perinatal mental health strategy” to support families before and after birth but provide little detail about what that would entail. GREENS The Green Party would look to increase funding to provinces to prioritize the expansion of mental health and rehabilitation services, redirect Health Canada’s mandate to focus on mental health and addictions, among other key items, and create an overarching national mental health strategy to address the ties between mental wellness and work productivity. In a statement to CTVNews.ca, Margaret Eaton, the national CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association said she’s pleased to see federal parties prioritizing mental health in the campaign. “This has been a long time coming. People in Canada are done waiting. Done with long wait times, having to pay out-of-pocket for mental health services and limited coverage through employer insurance plans, not to mention the impact of the pandemic on our mental health,” said Eaton. Speaking to the Liberal announcement specifically, she said the commitment to establish a new federal transfer for mental health would help fill the gaps in funding for services delivered outside the hospital and family doctors’ offices. But the question remains: how will the party keep provinces accountable for this? “The question of course now is, how much will this transfer entail? How will it hold provinces and territories accountable to delivering mental health care where it is needed most? Our mental health system needs fixing and bold leadership from all parties is essential. We’re off to strong start with commitments from most parties at this stage of the campaign, but we need to see more discussion around the what and the how,” she said.

With just three weeks to go until the Sept. 20 vote, tracking data ending Sunday and released Monday morning shows the Liberals projected to win 111 seats versus 107 for the Conservatives, a sharp change from an Aug. 22 projection that had the Liberals ahead of the Conservatives 128 to 94. A projection from June had the Liberals at 171 seats versus 59 for the Conservatives. “Check out the trendline, It’s basically a rocket for the Conservatives,” Nanos said on Friday's edition of CTV's Trend Line podcast. It's basically a tie for all intents and purposes.” Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign The data projects 31 seats for the NDP and 9 seats for the Bloc Quebecois. It also shows 79 seats considered too close to call, providing plenty of room for the results to shift before the election. The narrowing seat projection follows substantial gains by the Conservatives in ballot preference during the campaign, which began on Aug. 15. The latest results show the Conservatives in the lead at 32.7 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 31.3 per cent. BETTER CONSERVATIVE DISTRIBUTION However, the near tie in the seat projection marks a departure from the 2019 election, in which the Conservatives narrowly won the popular vote, but took 121 seats to the Liberals’ 157. “Conservative support is much better distributed in this particular election than in previous elections,” said Nanos. “The old structural advantage of the Liberals is not as strong.” He also attributed the better showing to Erin O’Toole’s increasing appeal as a potential leader and his positioning on issues such as mental health and on reproductive rights, where he is pro-choice. Indeed, O’Toole’s support as a potential leader has been gaining steadily, from 24.0 per cent on Aug. 23 to 27.9 per cent in the most recent result. Trudeau has seen his support decline from 32.7 per cent to 30.4 per cent in the same period. “(O’Toole’s positioning) has probably broadened the potential for the Conservative Party in a lot of different parts of the country,” said Nanos. The tracking show the NDP holding steady at 20.0 per cent of ballot support, while the Green Party sits at 5.9 per cent, the Bloc is at 5.8 per cent, and the People’s Party of Canada hold 3.6 per cent support. PARKING SPACE FOR THE DISAFFECTED While the PPC has consistently polled in last place, the party’s ballot support has remained steady in recent tracking, while leader Maxime Bernier’s preferred candidate results have strengthened to 4.0 per cent in the most recent tracking, ahead of Green Leader Annamie Paul at 2.0 per cent, and Bloc Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet at 2.6 per cent. Bernier’s libertarian-style campaign has stood apart from other candidates, as he has spoken out against lockdowns and vaccine passports, and is the only major political leader to not have received a COVID-19 vaccine. Nanos pointed out that Bernier will not be included in the leaders debates on Sept. 8 and 9, which means some of the support could flow to other parties in the actual election. “I think (PPC support) is a parking space for some disaffected and angry voters. It's probably also a parking space for some folks that don't like mandatory vaccinations,” said Nanos. NDP DEBATE BREAKOUT? Instead, Nanos predicted a potential debate storyline could be a breakout for the NDP if Leader Jagmeet Singh turns in a strong performance. “Because the race is closer, much more competitive, I think a lot more Canadians are going to tune into the debate,’” he said. Nanos said the key for Singh would be to turn progressive voters who may have voted Liberal previously, but who are wondering if they want to stick with Trudeau. “Jagmeet Singh has been in a number of debates and has done well in past leaders debates, so there will probably be an expectation that he'll do well in the debate,” said Nanos. Another question for the debate is whether Trudeau will use it as an opportunity to attack the Conservatives over crowds of anti-vaccine protesters that have dogged the Liberal campaign and forced the cancellation of a planned rally in Bolton, Ont. over security concerns. Nanos noted that Trudeau’s response to the protests so far have been measured on the issue. “There's no use in attacking O'Toole and trying to draw him out on this when Canadians might not be paying as much attention as they will during the debate,” said Nanos. “I think Trudeau's trying to keep his powder dry and probably even if there are more disruptions will just… wait for the debate to take to try to land a big punch on Erin O'Toole.” NANOS’ METHODOLOGY A national random telephone survey (land- and cellular-line sample using live agents) of 1,200 Canadians is conducted by Nanos Research throughout the campaign over a three-day period.

The estimated cost of the 44th federal election is $610 million, about $108 million more than the $502.4-million price tag for the 2019 election. Why is it so expensive? Blame it on COVID-19 and a growing population. “The main thing is COVID-19,” Lars Osberg, an economics professor at Dalhousie University, told CTV’s Your Morning on Wednesday. “When you have an election in COVID times, you have to have more people around the polls, you have to have Plexiglas everywhere, you have to have all the COVID protocols.” And that simply adds up. About $50 million of the new expenses this year will go to pandemic protocols and another $50 million will be due to population growth, Elections Canada said. There are about 38.1 million people living in the country now, compared with about 37.4 million in 2019. “The last election cost Canadians about $18.35 per registered voter,” Osberg said. “And the population has increased, so it’s kind of normal that the expenses of an election increase.” Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign The bulk of the election costs in the last federal vote -- $438 million -- went toward preparing for and running the actual event. It covered recruiting and training more than 200,000 election workers, printing ballots and lists of electors, leasing local offices and about 18,000 polling places, communications campaigns, IT equipment and shipping election materials. In 2019, all of this accounted for 87.25 per cent of the total election cost. The remaining $64.4 million went toward reimbursing parties and candidates. To be eligible for partial reimbursement of election expenses, candidates must be elected or obtain at least 10 per cent of the valid votes cast in their electoral district. “There are a lot of fine details that go into running an election,” Osberg said. And holding an election during the pandemic means accommodating for the times. Although the 250,000 polling workers won’t be required to be fully vaccinated, the polling stations will be “highly controlled,” Chief Electoral Officer Stephane Perrault said in a press conference on Aug. 18. “[Canadians] can expect to see essentially the kind of measures that they now have been seeing for the last 18 months. So, we will have people in charge of ensuring that the place is clean, that the electors are properly distanced. They will see for example these physical transparent barriers that will separate the poll workers,” said Perrault. Masks will be distributed, hand sanitizer enforced, and disposable pencils required, he added. According to recent surveys, the number of Canadians interested in casting a ballot by mail could be between two million and three million, compared with about 50,000 during the 2019 election. Elections Canada is increasing its capacity to process mail-in ballots and it may take longer to count them. Depending on how the vote goes, it could take up to five additional days after the election for the final results to come in for Canada’s most expensive federal election to date.

I imagine there's quite a few ridings where Justin Trudeau might be sweating, considering NDP support.” While it’s too early to know exactly how Thursday’s English-language debate will affect voter preferences, polling data continues to show a statistical tie among the two leading parties. According to Nanos Research’s nightly tracking conducted for CTV News and the Globe and Mail, released on Friday morning, the Conservatives hold 33.3 per cent support, while the Liberals are at 31.1 per cent. At 2.2 percentage points, the Conservative lead is within the survey’s margin of error of ± 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign SIPHONING SUPPORT? It’s a result that suggests a minority government for either party is the most likely result. But the picture could change if either party is able to siphon support from other parties, particularly the NDP or Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada (PPC), says Nanos. The NDP, traditionally ideologically left of the Liberals, are at 19.2 per cent in the latest tracking, while the PPC, which are further right than the Conservatives on the political spectrum, have seen their support build through the campaign to sit at five per cent. “If you add the People's Party at five per cent and the Conservatives at 33 per cent you put the Conservatives into majority territory at 38 (per cent),” said Nanos. Likewise, with the NDP having consistently polled around 20 per cent throughout the campaign, there is the potential for the Liberals to either gain votes from, or lose them to, the party. “I think we saw a little bit of that at the at the end of the (debate) where [Liberal Leader] Justin Trudeau was interjecting with [NDP Leader] Jagmeet Singh, and basically trying to tell people, ‘if you want to stop the Conservatives there's only one option if you're a progressive voter and it's the Liberals,’” Nanos said. According to Nanos' preferred candidate tracking, there is still room for support to shift, as 12.6 per cent of Canadians say they are still unsure of their preference. The latest data also shows Trudeau polling at 30 per cent as voters' preferred prime minister, compared to O’Toole at 27.1 per cent and Singh at 19.9 per cent. Bernier is at 5.5 per cent, Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet is at 3.2 per cent, and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul is at 1.6 per cent. “If the NDP continue to hold their numbers… it’s just going to be mathematically very difficult for the Liberals to win a majority government,” said Nanos. PPC DEMOGRAPHICS Bernier, who was not invited to the debate, has seen support for his party grow steadily throughout the campaign, from 1.9 per cent on Aug. 12 to the latest result of 5.0 per cent. Nanos said that the demographics of PPC supporters tend to skew young and male, which is similar to the makeup of far-right movements that have been prominent in the United States and other countries. “We see that same international trend in Canada in terms of the demographic for these populist parties being younger and more likely to be male,” he said. NANOS’ METHODOLOGY A national random telephone survey (land- and cellular-line sample using live agents) of 1,200 Canadians is conducted by Nanos Research throughout the campaign over a three-day period. Each evening a new group of 400 eligible voters are interviewed. The daily tracking figures are based on a three-day rolling sample comprising 1,200 interviews. To update the tracking a new day of interviewing is added and the oldest day dropped. The margin of error for a survey of 1,200 respondents is ± 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The respondent sample is stratified geographically and by gender. The data may be weighted by age according to data from the 2016 Canadian Census administered by Statistics Canada. Percentages reported may not add up to 100 due to rounding.

Jackie Dunham CTVNews.ca Writer @JaclynLDunham Contact Published Wednesday, September 8, 2021 2:06PM EDT Last Updated Wednesday, September 8, 2021 7:56PM EDT Share: Reddit Share Text: TORONTO -- With just 12 days left in the federal election campaign, the two leading political parties appear to be locked in a dead heat with neither of them poised to win a majority government, according to national polling data. So how can the Liberals and Conservatives move the political needle in their favour and where do the other parties stand? According to Nanos Research’s nightly tracking data conducted for CTV News and the Globe and Mail, which was released on Wednesday morning, the Conservatives have 32.6 per cent support among Canadians and are in statistical tie with the Liberals at 31.6 per cent. The NDP is behind at 21.1. per cent support, followed by the BQ at 5 per cent, the Green Party at 4.4 per cent, and the PPC at 4.3 per cent. How to watch the federal leaders' debates Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign 2021 platform guide: Where do the parties stand? Nik Nanos, founder and chief data scientist at Nanos Research, said the party leaders might have the opportunity to shift the momentum on their side at the two official debates this week. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul are expected to square off at the French debate on Wednesday and the English debate on Thursday in Gatineau, Que. People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier will not be allowed to participate in the debates because he didn’t meet the criteria established by the independent leaders’ debate commission. LIBERALS For Trudeau, specifically, who called the election during the summer in the hopes his party could pick up more seats to form a majority government, Nanos said he expects the Liberal leader to focus on his closest rival O’Toole during the debate. “I would expect that he's probably going to clearly have his sights set on Erin O'Toole, because Erin O’Toole’s brand has improved over the course of the campaign,” Nanos said on Wednesday’s edition of CTV’s Trend Line podcast. Nanos said viewers might see Trudeau question O’Toole on his party’s changing stance on gun control after they amended their platform over the weekend to pledge they wouldn’t repeal a 2020 ban on certain firearms after initially stating they would. Trudeau might also go after Blanchet during the debate, Nanos said, because Quebec is a critical battleground for the Liberals. Pauline Beange, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto, said Trudeau’s Liberals will want to retain as many seats as they can in Quebec while taking some from the NDP and the Conservatives in the Toronto area and Ontario more broadly. “He can't afford to lose any in the West, but the primary vote-rich areas are Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes,” she told CTV’s Your Morning on Wednesday. Trudeau will have the most difficult task this election campaign, according to Beange, because he’s the incumbent. “He has lost the trust of many Canadian voters who voted for him in 2015 as a fresh new face,” she said. Beange pointed to Trudeau’s multiple ethics violations, including the Aga Khan affair and the SNC-Lavalin scandal, as examples. “He has to try and rebuild trust, which is a great deal harder than building trust in the first place,” she said. CONSERVATIVES As for the Conservatives, Nanos said it’s important for O’Toole to present himself as prime ministerial during the debates. He said he thinks Trudeau and Blanchet will be O’Toole’s main targets on the debate stage. “A lot of his pickup has actually been from disaffected Liberals. So I would expect him to go after Trudeau in the hope of getting more blue Liberals to swing over into the into the true blue call,” Nanos said. “I would expect him also to go after Blanchet because there's crossover between some of those Bloc Quebecois supporters and Conservative supporters in Quebec.” Beyond the debate, Beange said O’Toole needs to maintain a strong campaign on the local level. “A strong local campaign has been shown in research to add up to 10 per cent in vote share in that riding,” she said. “He should concentrate on that.” Beange added that the Conservatives should also be wary of losing right-wing supporters to the People’s Party of Canada. NDP Finally, Nanos said he expects Singh to go after Trudeau and O’Toole during the debates. “He's going to target O’Toole to compare and contrast Singh's vision for Canada compared to O’Toole’s vision for Canada,” he said. “I expect him to take on Justin Trudeau and the Liberals for not moving fast enough, not delivering on their promises, not moving forward in a progressive sense.” Beange said Singh will pick up more votes during the campaign if he can convince Canadians that he can manage the economy and the NDP has the “depth” to do it. She said the party should explain how they’re going to create wealth in Canada. “It’s not enough to say this is how much this is going to cost, Canadians want to know how he's going to pay for those programs,” she said.

On the eve of the Labour Day weekend, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam took aim at young adults, describing an ""urgent need"" for more people between the ages of 18 and 39 to get vaccinated in order to prevent a rapid worsening of Canada's COVID-19 situation. ""The moment you get people back indoors … we will see accelerations,"" she said Friday at a press conference. Data released by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) shows that 74 per cent of those between the ages of 18 and 29 and 77 per cent of those in their 30s have been fully vaccinated, versus 82 per cent of those in their 40s and even higher percentages of older age groups. In addition, Tam said, those younger adults ""continue to have the highest rates of infection,"" in part because they are more likely to have close contact with people outside their household for work-related or recreational reasons. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox There is also a regional disparity in vaccination rates. While 84 per cent of eligible vaccine recipients across Canada have received at least one dose, the rate is only 78 per cent in Alberta and 76 per cent in Saskatchewan. From mid-July to mid-August, Tam said, the COVID-19 infection rate was 12 times higher among the unvaccinated than the vaccinated, and the hospitalization rate was 36 times higher. PHAC estimates that 5.2 million eligible Canadians have not yet received any COVID-19 vaccination, while another 2.5 million are only considered partially vaccinated. ""The bottom line is that millions of people across Canada remain unvaccinated and at high risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness outcomes,"" Tam said. A BLEAK FALL FORECAST Tam also called on all Canadians to limit their contacts as summer comes to a close, sending many back to schools and workplaces. ""Right now is not the time to gather in huge numbers with people that are not in your household, without taking significant layers of protection,"" she said. However, the chief doctor repeatedly emphasized that the country still has a ""window of opportunity"" to avoid skyrocketing case counts and an overwhelmed health-care system later this month, suggesting that renewed provincial restrictions could have an impact. ""Of course we can do something about a resurgence, and I've seen provinces do that,"" she said. The PHAC modelling data suggests that if public health measures are able to reduce the level of transmission across the country by 25 per cent, the fourth wave of the pandemic could soon plateau at a lower daily infection rate than the peaks of the second and third waves. Source: Public Health Agency of Canada PHAC reports that Canada is experiencing ""ongoing rapid acceleration"" of COVID-19 activity, including in cases causing severe illness. Tam said that the number of new hospitalizations related to COVID-19 in Canada has more than doubled since the last modelling was released on July 30, and is now above 1,200 per day. She attributed the increase in virus activity to slow vaccine uptake and an ""earlier than expected reopening"" in some parts of the country. There is not yet any indication that the fourth wave is resulting in an increase in deaths among COVID-19 patients, the data shows. Source: Public Health Agency of Canada FIRST BRIEFING SINCE ELECTION CALLED Friday was the first time Tam or other PHAC officials directly addressed reporters since the federal election was called in mid-August. Such press conferences had been a regular occurrence prior to the election. The modelling was initially slated to be released without a press conference, in what would have been a departure from PHAC's usual practice. The agency reversed course on that decision last week, amid questions about changing communications strategy during the federal election. Asked about the reversal, Tam said that she had been communicating with the public during the election campaign through written press releases and her social media accounts, and hinted that there will be more press conferences to come. ""Given where the epidemic is heading, I expect to be providing regular briefings to all of you,"" she said. Correction: A previous version of this story stated that 84 per cent of eligible vaccine recipients have received two doses. That is the percentage that have received at least one dose.

The parties were required to submit their final list of candidate nominations to Elections Canada by the Aug. 30 deadline – 21 days before election day. According to Equal Voice, a not-for-profit organization that tracks gender diversity in Canadian politics, women and gender-diverse candidates account for 43 per cent of all nominees across the five major parties – a slight increase from the 42 per cent total in the 2019 federal election. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign Equal Voice’s Executive Director Eleanor Fast said they were worried the disproportionate effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on women in many areas of the country would affect their participation in the election. “So, for that reason, we are happy to see the numbers, basically at the same levels of 2019, although a little bit better, which is always the right direction to go in,” she told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Thursday. Fast said they were also concerned there would be fewer female candidates during this election because research has shown that women are more likely to participate when there is a fixed election date. In light of those concerns, Fast said they are “reasonably happy” with the percentage of female and gender-diverse candidates running in this election. She added that they’re always watching to see if women and gender-diverse candidates are being nominated in winnable ridings. “That's always a big concern because it's all very well being able to say a certain percentage of your candidates are women or gender-diverse people, but are you supporting them adequately and are they going to get elected on election night?” she said. For example, during the 2019 election, Fast said 42 per cent of candidates were women or gender-diverse people, but only 29 per cent of all elected MPs were women. “We hope that that doesn't play out again this time,” she said. Digging into the numbers, the NDP has the highest percentage of women or gender diverse candidates on its list with 52 per cent, or 175 candidates – a slight increase from 2019 when it had 49 per cent. The Bloc Quebecois has the second-highest percentage of women candidates with 47 per cent, or 37 of their 78 candidates, running in Quebec. That number is up from 45 per cent in 2019. As of Thursday morning, the Green Party isn't running a full slate of candidates with 252 people on its list. Of those, 112 (44 per cent) are women or gender-diverse candidates. Fast said that number could change in the coming days, however, and they will continue to track the party’s list of candidates. The Liberals’ list includes 147, or 43 per cent, women candidates this year – an increase from 39 per cent in 2019. Finally, the Conservatives have also increased their number of female candidates this year with 111 nominees, or 33 per cent – up slightly from 32 per cent in 2019. In total, Equal Voice tallied 582 women or gender diverse candidates running in this year’s federal election. During the last election, 98 women were elected, or 29 per cent of the total elected representatives in Parliament. Before Parliament was dissolved in August, there were 100 female MPs in the House of Commons, which placed Canada in 55th place in the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s (IPU) global rankings of women in national parliaments. This election, Equal Voice said they’re hoping Canadians will elect more than 136 women or gender diverse candidates on Sept. 20 so they can achieve 40 per cent gender parity in the House of Commons. “To get to 40 per cent of MPs being women, and that would mean 136 women or gender-diverse people being elected,” Fast said. “Our hope would be to get to 136 in this election, obviously, that’s an ambitious aim, a big jump, but that's what we will be looking for on election night.” RELATED IMAGES view larger image The percentage of female or gender-diverse candidates running for each of the main five federal parties is shown in this graph.

On Tuesday, Statistics Canada reported that the economy contracted at an annualized rate of 1.1 per cent between April and June – the first quarterly contraction since the first COVID-19 wave lockdowns in 2020. To make matters worse, the agency also estimated another drop in real gross domestic product in July. “The news yesterday that the economy had shrank would not be good for any incumbent government,” Nanos said on Wednesday’s edition of CTV's Trend Line podcast. “The last thing that you want is for the numbers to come out and to suggest that the economy is shrinking.” Nanos said the Liberals called the election when they did because they were hoping to capitalize on good will from the Canadian public for their handling of the pandemic and the supply of COVID-19 vaccines they procured while getting ahead of future concerns about the economy related to the pandemic. “This GDP number is bad for the Liberals,” he said. “It undermines one of the key pillars that they were hoping would be in place.” This latest news also won’t help to restore Canadians’ faith in the economy, according to Nanos, who said the population is already feeling “grumpy” about it. He said the latest weekly Bloomberg-Nanos tracking on consumer confidence shows that. According to the data, 37 per cent of Canadians believe the economy will get stronger (down seven percentage points from four weeks earlier), while 30 per cent believe the economy will get weaker, and about 20 per cent believe there will be no change. “The trend in terms of consumer confidence has been dropping over the last couple of weeks and couple that with a drop or shrinking of the economy and the GDP, it is basically a one-two punch in terms of creating negativity, anxiety and concern among Canadians when it comes to the economy,” Nanos said. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign And while the shrinking economy spells trouble for the Liberals, Nanos said the Conservatives won’t fare much better thanks to their dependence on economic growth in their platform. According to the plan, the Conservatives would be able to balance the budget without any cuts within 10 years. However, the plan hinges on the assumption that there will be an annual GDP growth of roughly three per cent, which some economists believe is unrealistic, Nanos said. “These GDP numbers don’t help [Conservative Leader] Erin O’Toole because if the economy is shrinking, and your fiscal plan is based on the economy growing, it’s hard to reconcile those two things, at least for average voters,” Nanos said. O’Toole will need to defend his platform in order to maintain the “mini advantage” he has over Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in Nanos Research’s latest nightly tracking conducted for CTV News and the Globe and Mail, which was released on Wednesday morning. According to the data, the Conservatives are leading with 33.7 per cent support, followed by the Liberals with 31 per cent, and the NDP with 20.3 per cent. The other parties trail significantly behind with the Bloc Quebecois at 6.8 per cent, the People’s Party of Canada at 4.1 per cent, and the Greens at 3.5 per cent. In terms of who Canadians prefer for their next prime minister, Trudeau has a slight lead with 29.2 per cent support, followed by O’Toole with 28.4 per cent, and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh at 19.2 per cent. PPC Leader Maxime Bernier has 4.9 per cent support, just ahead of BQ Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, and Green Leader Annamie Paul. ‘IT’S HOUSING, STUPID’ The economy, and more specifically housing affordability, is also a main topic of concern for Canadians living in the vote-rich Greater Toronto Area, Nanos said. According to polling data commissioned by CTV News and CP24 that was released on Tuesday, housing is the number one priority for voters living in Toronto and the surrounding area and one that all parties will have to address if they want to win votes there. “More than four out of every 10 residents in the GTA unprompted, which means when they could say whatever they wanted, identify housing as their as their top concern,” Nanos said. “What was it that one American strategist said, ‘It's the economy, stupid’?” Nanos said. “That's probably what GTA residents want to say to any politician from any stripe, ‘It's housing, stupid.’” And although Toronto and the GTA are traditionally a Liberal stronghold, Nanos said it was interesting that when residents were asked who best understands the issues in their area, it was a three-way tie between Trudeau, O’Toole, and Singh. “That means that there's also opportunity not just for Erin O'Toole, but for Jagmeet Singh. He's got a good brand. His brand is exceptionally strong among under 35s in the in the GTA and if he can get young people to get out and vote, it can be a bit of a game changer for him,” he said. NANOS’ METHODOLOGY A national random telephone survey (land- and cellular-line sample using live agents) of 1,200 Canadians is conducted by Nanos Research throughout the campaign over a three-day period. Each evening a new group of 400 eligible voters are interviewed. The daily tracking figures are based on a three-day rolling sample comprising 1,200 interviews. To update the tracking a new day of interviewing Is added and the oldest day dropped. The margin of error for a survey of 1,200 respondents is ± 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The respondent sample is stratified geographically and by gender. The data may be weighted by age according to data from the 2016 Canadian Census administered by Statistics Canada. Percentages reported may not add up to 100 due to rounding. RELATED IMAGES view larger image Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole are seen in this composite image.

Trudeau unveiled the Canada Mental Health Transfer that would deliver permanent funding to participating provinces and territories to create more “high-quality, accessible, and free” services with an initial investment of $4.5 billion over five years. “This funding, and this new transfer will mean everything from shorter wait times to more mental health professionals on the job,” said Trudeau, speaking in the Ottawa suburb of Kanata. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign The Liberals are also pledging $500 million over four years to introduce a student-focused mental health fund to decrease wait times by hiring up to 1,200 new mental health care counsellors at post-secondary institutions. Ten per cent annually will go to Indigenous-governed and operated schools. “If you’ve been in crisis and faced a waitlist, if you’re a student struggling to pay both rent and a therapist, you know there’s a lot of work still do to,” said Trudeau. “Mental health should be a priority even within our health-care system.” Similar to the Conservatives, they’re committing to implement a national three-digit mental health crisis and suicide prevention hotline. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is in the process of holding public consultations on the advantages and challenges associated with the implementation of a singular hotline after Parliament green-lighted a Conservative-backed motion to consolidate regional numbers. CONSERVATIVES Taking action on Canada’s mental health crisis – heightened throughout the duration of the pandemic – is a key pillar of the Conservative platform. They, too, plan to establish an arrangement with the provinces and territories whereby a portion of the Canada Health Transfer goes directly towards improving access to mental health services. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign 2021 platform guide: Where do the parties stand? The party’s platform states that that they will “encourage” employers to add mental health coverage to employee benefit plans by offering a 25 per cent tax credit for the cost of mental health coverage for the first three years. Additionally, they’ll create a $150 million grant program over three years for non-profits and charities delivering mental health and wellness programming. Meanwhile the Liberals, if re-elected, will aim to include mental health as a “specific element” of occupational health and safety under the Canada Labour Code, and require federally-regulated employers to take preventative steps to address workplace stress and injury. NEW DEMOCRATS The NDP have promised more broadly to include some currently privatized mental health services under the umbrella of Canada’s public system. “As a first step, a New Democrat government would bring in mental health care for uninsured Canadians – ensuring that people with no coverage for mental health services could gain access to these supports without worrying about the cost,” their platform reads. The party also notes that their proposed pharmacare plan would help alleviate steep medication costs. They’d also like to establish a “national perinatal mental health strategy” to support families before and after birth but provide little detail about what that would entail. GREENS The Green Party would look to increase funding to provinces to prioritize the expansion of mental health and rehabilitation services, redirect Health Canada’s mandate to focus on mental health and addictions, among other key items, and create an overarching national mental health strategy to address the ties between mental wellness and work productivity. In a statement to CTVNews.ca, Margaret Eaton, the national CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association said she’s pleased to see federal parties prioritizing mental health in the campaign. “This has been a long time coming. People in Canada are done waiting. Done with long wait times, having to pay out-of-pocket for mental health services and limited coverage through employer insurance plans, not to mention the impact of the pandemic on our mental health,” said Eaton. Speaking to the Liberal announcement specifically, she said the commitment to establish a new federal transfer for mental health would help fill the gaps in funding for services delivered outside the hospital and family doctors’ offices. But the question remains: how will the party keep provinces accountable for this? “The question of course now is, how much will this transfer entail? How will it hold provinces and territories accountable to delivering mental health care where it is needed most? Our mental health system needs fixing and bold leadership from all parties is essential. We’re off to strong start with commitments from most parties at this stage of the campaign, but we need to see more discussion around the what and the how,” she said.

The team at Hamilton General invited CTV News inside the tense ICU in the hopes of giving Canadians a look at the reality they go through every week as Delta cases climb. “I think it's important for Canadians to see that this is real,” Dr. Sunjay Sharma, medical director of critical care, told CTV News. “None of these people thought two months ago they would end up here. And now they're here. And some of them won’t survive.” Inside this ICU, on the day of CTV’s visit, 30 per cent of the 45 beds are COVID-19 patients fighting for their lives, most of them infected recently. And every person that was admitted during the fourth wave declined vaccination or just didn’t get around to it before they fell ill. “It’s crazy people don’t believe it,” Sharma said. “We come to work every day. This is real. It’s like someone telling you the sky is not blue.” Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox They want those who don’t believe the risk of COVID-19 is real to see the enormous strain that this work is having on health care workers, who are already exhausted from almost two years of fighting. The unvaccinated COVID-19 patients this hospital is seeing are younger and healthier, in their 30s and 40s. Many them require a specialized form of life support called ECMO, in which their blood is removed to be given oxygen and pumped back into the body because their lungs have failed. It’s the “highest level of life support you can get anywhere,” Sharma said. He pointed out a patient in his 40s, who is hooked up to an ECMO machine. “There's a catheter the size of a garden hose in his neck, and there's a catheter the size of a garden hose [at his] groin,” Sharma said. “And basically it takes the blood out of his groin, puts it the machine, takes the carbon dioxide out, [puts in] the oxygen, and then comes back into his heart.” Most of the patients who are on ECMO with COVID-19 don’t have significant co-morbidities. “It’s scary. It’s people younger than me, in some cases healthier than me,” Sharma said. Only four hospitals in Ontario offer ECMO support. Toronto General is one of the four, and told CTV News that they have 13 COVID-19 patients on ECMO currently, all of whom are unvaccinated. And it’s not only happening in Ontario. Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, tweeted Wednesday that of the 218 COVID-19 patients who are in ICU in the province, 92.3 per cent are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. There are several million Canadians who are not vaccinated, some who have chosen not to get even one dose of the vaccine. Some may have legitimate medical exemptions. But there are others who refuse saying the vaccines don't work, they aren't safe, that COVID-19 itself is a hoax. Health workers who see patients stricken with the virus every day know it is no hoax and say that across the country hospitals and ICU's are slowing filling up with patients — almost all of whom are unvaccinated. The fourth wave is a wave almost entirely among those who have not gotten their shot, they say. At Hamilton General, all of the COVID-19 patients in the ICU are unvaccinated, and eight are on ECMO. Dr. Faizan Amin, medical director of the ECMO unit, said he hoped seeing into the situation in the hospital would change some minds. “Some of the viewers that have those beliefs will be able to watch this on TV, and there is nothing unreal about these people, they’re real life people, they’re real fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters — real human beings and they're getting very sick,” Amin said. A month ago, this ICU had just one COVID-19 patient. Now they have 14 -- and four-to-five requests a week to accept more patients from other hospitals who need more intensive care. And as the ICU fills up with COVID-19 victims and other patients suffering from urgent issues such as strokes, heart attacks and physical trauma, other surgeries get cancelled. “This ICU serves cardiac surgery, or surgery and trauma, vascular surgery, stroke. It is the regional hospital for all of this region for 2.5 million people,” Sharma said, adding that around 15 other hospitals frequently send patients here if they need a higher level of care. THE VACCINE STRUGGLE Some COVID-19 patients have expressed regret once they understand the magnitude of their situation. Erin, an ICU nurse who asked us not to use her last name, told CTV News that “a lot of people have been asking for vaccines, right before they get intubated. But it’s too late.” But some skeptics don’t change their mind even when on the edge of death, she reported, adding that some who have been on ECMO and recovered still say there isn’t enough research about the vaccines that would’ve likely prevented their own suffering. “There is a small subset of people that we're still seeing who feel that this is not a real disease, or it's not as dangerous as some people are making it out to be — but the reality is in front of our eyes,” Amin said. One of the patients who has been on ECMO in Hamilton General for the longest period of time is a patient in his 30s who has been in the hospital for months — he fell ill before he was able to be vaccinated because it hadn’t been opened up to his age group yet. Unlike the COVID-19 patients coming into the ICU this month, “he did not have a choice,” Sharma said. The man has been totally healthy before he contracted COVID-19, Sharma said. Health care workers are dedicated to giving everyone the best care possible, but it is frustrating seeing patients who didn’t need to be suffering to this degree, they say. “To know that their families didn't have to go through that and the patients didn't have to go through that, if they just got [a shot] that takes 30 seconds,” Sharma said. “It's frustrating, and you just can't understand the rationale behind why you wouldn't get a vaccine. “We see this every day — this is where you end up when you don’t.” Sharma said that when they have patients who are unvaccinated, their family members often change their own minds about vaccination after seeing their loved one suffer. “Many of the family members of people who are here and are unvaccinated, after seeing their family members here for a week, get vaccinated,” he said. “It's unfortunate that it's taken sort of that experience to change some behaviours,” Amin said. Sharma is not only frustrated with the individuals, but with the larger machine of misinformation that leads people to be confused about vaccines and what is best for their health. “It's anger with the social contract that got them into this situation, it is anger of people posting on social media that COVID-19 is not real, or that vaccines don’t work,” Sharma said. “That basically preys on vulnerable people, that makes them make bad decisions that lands them up here.” Seventy-eight per cent of eligible Canadians have been fully vaccinated. Side effects are rare according to public health officials as are breakthrough COVID-19 cases, and vaccines have been proven to drastically minimize severe cases of COVID-19 as well as death in the event of a breakthrough case. And yet, in this fourth wave, we’ve seen a baffling level of animosity displayed towards health care workers from a small subset of people, ranging from anti-vaccine groups protesting outside of hospitals to individual health care workers receiving threats. A year ago, it went unquestioned that health care workers were heroes. But now some groups are looking for someone to blame. “This morning I got some angry phone calls from people in the public because of my advocacy for vaccines,” Sharma said. He said it’s not only frustrating, but personally insulting that people would think that he’s taking time away from his family not to take care of sick patients but to prop up some lie about the virus. ""I have two young kids who I went for weeks without seeing, because I was here [at the hospital],” he said. “I don’t think that there's any motivation for healthcare workers to lie.” Nurses told CTV News that they know colleagues who have been spat on by protestors, booed. “They think it’s a hoax and that honestly is a slap in the face to us after everything that we've been doing,” said Erin. A HEALTH CARE HOUSE OF CARDS That animosity is one more burden for health care workers during this fourth wave, on top of increasing burnout and short staffing. Amin pointed out that when the third wave hit in the spring, it put more pressure on the health care system than had occurred in a year of COVID-19. “We've been going at this in full gear for 18 months, and working that hard for that long for all the healthcare providers here that are looking after these patients, it's very difficult,” he said. Michael Plaunt, clinical manager of the coronary care unit at Hamilton General, told CTV News that everyone is tired. “They're burnt out, they're exhausted,” he said. “At the beginning, we didn't have any way to prevent this. And now that we have a way to prevent this, we should be seeing that improve, and we're not. So that's the frustration.” Health care workers say the circumstances of many of these fourth wave cases eats away at the compassion that is integral to their work. “We will come in in the middle of the night to take care of a sick patient, no matter the time of day or the day of the week,” Amin said. “But when it's an easily preventable situation, you start to start to lose some of the empathy. And that's a key factor of what we do as healthcare providers — we are empathetic and compassionate and you want to continue being that way.” Medical staff are becoming clearly fatigued, in more ways than one. At Hamilton General alone, around 12 staff members have left their job between the third and fourth waves. “The system is cracking,” Amin said. “The fourth wave is in many ways worse than the third wave. Although the number of cases in the community are not as high as we were seeing in the third wave, the amount of resources we have left within the healthcare system are much less now than they were in the third wave because of things like burnout and exit of staff members.” He pointed out that because of the burden on the health care system from COVID-19 patients, those who are getting ill from other diseases and conditions are having their care further delayed because of mostly preventable COVID-19 cases. Health care workers are urging those who are still on the fence about vaccination to get their shots. “I don’t think we are at the crest of the fourth wave,” said Sharma. “I think the wave is building. I think it’s going to get worse.” And if health care workers don’t get a moment to breathe soon, it could mean big problems not just for COVID-19 patients, but everyone. “I don't think a wise thing would be to push those people again to the max, because we still have a healthcare system to run after COVID is over,” Sharma said. “And I think we can't lose sight of that.” RELATED IMAGES view larger image A third of the beds in this ICU in Hamilton General are taken up by COVID-19 patients, most of whom are in their 30s and 40s, and all unvaccinated.

According to Nanos Research’s nightly tracking data conducted for CTV News and the Globe and Mail, support for Singh as the preferred prime minister has steadily declined over the past four days. The latest polling data, which was released Monday, puts him at 16.3 per cent support – a marked drop from the 21.2 per cent support he enjoyed on Thursday. “The one definitive trend in the last four days is Jagmeet Singh and the big question is: ‘Is that a leading indicator that some New Democrats might swing to the Liberals?’” Nanos asked during Monday’s edition of CTV’s Trend Line podcast. While Nanos said it’s too early to tell how Singh’s waning support might affect the final results, he said a leader’s polling numbers usually provide an early indication of the party’s overall support. “For people that are supporting the New Democrats, it's not like one day they support the New Democrats and another day they support another party,” Nanos said. “So Singh should be a little worried about his numbers declining because it may suggest that some of this support might decline perhaps later this week.” As for why Singh’s popularity appears to be dropping, Nanos said the leader’s support has been consistent throughout the campaign and the decline has only been over the past four days, which coincides with when the English-language leaders’ debate aired on Sept. 9. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign In addition to the debate, Nanos said the NDP recently revealed how they would pay for their election promises with the release of their costed platform on Saturday. According to the party’s calculations, the NDP’s platform would cost $214 billion over five years, with $166 billion in projected revenues from the Parliamentary Budget Office. “Within the context of the other two parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, they're still spending more money, and now the New Democrats with their platform, want to outspend both the Liberals and the Conservatives,” Nanos said. “We’ll see in a couple of nights whether perhaps people aren't hot on that much of a deficit and that much of an increase in spending.” In terms of support for the other party leaders, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau continues to maintain his slight lead on the preferred prime minister front with 33 per cent support, followed by Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole with 28 per cent. The People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier leads among the remaining parties with six per cent support, trailed by Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet at 3.5 per cent and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul at 2.6 per cent. Interestingly, Nanos noted that the percentage of Canadians who are undecided in their choice for preferred prime minister has plummeted to 10.6 per cent. “It’s the lowest that we’ve seen in the campaign and it’s quite low,” he said. ‘WHITE-KNUCKLE WEEK’ With advance polling already underway and the clock ticking, Nanos said the parties will have their work cut out for them during this final “white-knuckle week” of the campaign. According to the nightly tracking data released on Monday, here’s how Nanos’ daily ballot tracking numbers break down: Liberals 33.2 per cent; Conservatives 30.2 per cent; NDP 18.6 per cent; Bloc Quebecois 6.8 per cent; People’s Party of Canada 6.6 per cent; and Green Party 3.8 per cent “It’s still a statistical tie. I know it shows the Liberals numerically ahead, but it's still very close between the Liberals and the Conservatives,” Nanos said. “[It’s] a toss up right now.” WHAT THE LEADERS NEED TO DO IN THE HOME STRETCH Looking ahead, Nanos said he expects Trudeau will spend the last week of the campaign answering questions about his former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and the SNC-Lavalin affair after she released excerpts from her upcoming memoir over the weekend. “I think this is going to be the issue that probably dogs Trudeau at every single event that he has,” Nanos predicted. Additionally, Nanos said he thinks Trudeau will try to demonize the Conservatives during the final stretch in an effort to stoke fear among voters. “The Liberals, they save the heavy fear cards to the very end,” he said. For the Conservatives, on the other hand, Nanos said O’Toole’s strategy will likely focus on presenting a prime ministerial appearance while avoiding any mistakes and positioning himself as a change that’s not risky. “Because the Liberal strategy will try to portray Erin O’Toole as risky change,” Nanos said. The Singh and the NDP will have a fine line to toe this week, according to Nanos, who said the party will likely try to distinguish themselves from the other parties with their big-spending platform, but try to do so in a way that doesn’t alienate voters and risk driving them to the Liberals. “I think in the longer term, this is a clever strategy because it suggests that if the Liberals win, or the Conservatives win, for that matter, his job will be to get more for Canadians,” Nanos said. “The problem is in the short term, will he get crushed in strategic voting as has happened in the last couple of elections?” Blanchet, however, will likely have a more straightforward strategy for the week ahead, according to Nanos, one that’s focused on drawing support from the Liberals to the BQ in Quebec. “Our polling suggests that the island of Montreal remains a fortress for the Liberals by and large, but once you step off of the island of Montreal, it's actually very competitive between the Bloc and the Liberals,” he said. For Paul and the Green Party, Nanos said a best-case scenario for them would be to hold on to their two seats in British Columbia and for Paul to win her riding in Toronto and then go through the process of rebuilding and healing the party after all of the divisions they’ve experienced. Finally, Nanos said Bernier’s support is surprisingly high at 6 per cent considering he was left out of the two official leaders’ debates last week. “The big question is will that be a spoiler for the Conservatives?” Nanos said. “Bernier is still a factor. Can he deliver on those polling numbers? We'll see how well organized and how motivated those People’s Party of Canada supporters are.” NANOS’ METHODOLOGY A national random telephone survey (land- and cellular-line sample using live agents) of 1,200 Canadians is conducted by Nanos Research throughout the campaign over a three-day period. Each evening a new group of 400 eligible voters are interviewed. The daily tracking figures are based on a three-day rolling sample comprising 1,200 interviews. To update the tracking a new day of interviewing is added and the oldest day dropped. The margin of error for a survey of 1,200 respondents is ± 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The respondent sample is stratified geographically and by gender. The data may be weighted by age according to data from the 2016 Canadian Census administered by Statistics Canada. Percentages reported may not add up to 100 due to rounding. RELATED IMAGES view larger image NDP leader Jagmeet Singh speaks in Sioux Lookout, Ont., Monday, September 13, 2021.

I imagine there's quite a few ridings where Justin Trudeau might be sweating, considering NDP support.” While it’s too early to know exactly how Thursday’s English-language debate will affect voter preferences, polling data continues to show a statistical tie among the two leading parties. According to Nanos Research’s nightly tracking conducted for CTV News and the Globe and Mail, released on Friday morning, the Conservatives hold 33.3 per cent support, while the Liberals are at 31.1 per cent. At 2.2 percentage points, the Conservative lead is within the survey’s margin of error of ± 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Election Dispatch: Sign up for a daily update on the campaign SIPHONING SUPPORT? It’s a result that suggests a minority government for either party is the most likely result. But the picture could change if either party is able to siphon support from other parties, particularly the NDP or Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada (PPC), says Nanos. The NDP, traditionally ideologically left of the Liberals, are at 19.2 per cent in the latest tracking, while the PPC, which are further right than the Conservatives on the political spectrum, have seen their support build through the campaign to sit at five per cent. “If you add the People's Party at five per cent and the Conservatives at 33 per cent you put the Conservatives into majority territory at 38 (per cent),” said Nanos. Likewise, with the NDP having consistently polled around 20 per cent throughout the campaign, there is the potential for the Liberals to either gain votes from, or lose them to, the party. “I think we saw a little bit of that at the at the end of the (debate) where [Liberal Leader] Justin Trudeau was interjecting with [NDP Leader] Jagmeet Singh, and basically trying to tell people, ‘if you want to stop the Conservatives there's only one option if you're a progressive voter and it's the Liberals,’” Nanos said. According to Nanos' preferred candidate tracking, there is still room for support to shift, as 12.6 per cent of Canadians say they are still unsure of their preference. The latest data also shows Trudeau polling at 30 per cent as voters' preferred prime minister, compared to O’Toole at 27.1 per cent and Singh at 19.9 per cent. Bernier is at 5.5 per cent, Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet is at 3.2 per cent, and Green Party Leader Annamie Paul is at 1.6 per cent. “If the NDP continue to hold their numbers… it’s just going to be mathematically very difficult for the Liberals to win a majority government,” said Nanos. PPC DEMOGRAPHICS Bernier, who was not invited to the debate, has seen support for his party grow steadily throughout the campaign, from 1.9 per cent on Aug. 12 to the latest result of 5.0 per cent. Nanos said that the demographics of PPC supporters tend to skew young and male, which is similar to the makeup of far-right movements that have been prominent in the United States and other countries. “We see that same international trend in Canada in terms of the demographic for these populist parties being younger and more likely to be male,” he said.

According to Canada Border Services Agency data, between Sept. 6 and Sept. 12, 95,381 foreign nationals who were travelling by commercial air landed in Canada, compared to 79,886 the week prior. The government announced in July that anyone fully vaccinated with one of Health Canada’s approved vaccines would be able to enter the country for discretionary purposes as of Sept. 7, so long as they abided by additional COVID-19 screening measures. Travellers must have received the “full series,” or a combination of vaccines, 14 days prior to departure, submitted that information on the ArriveCAN app or on the equivalent website, provided a molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before their scheduled departure flight, and taken another test upon arrival. Commercial air traveller volume by foreign nationals hovered around the 70,000 through most of August and between 15,000 to 45,000 per week in June and July. The August increase correlates with Canada opening its doors to fully vaccinated Americans for non-essential purposes. At the same time, several airports, including Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport and Quebec City Jean Lesage International Airport, began once again receiving international flights. While there was a slight increase in arrivals between Sept. 6 to Sept. 12, the higher traveller volume is still nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. More than 326,000 foreign nationals arrived in Canada during the same week in 2019. All total, international traveller volume – including Canadians – sat at 209,838, compared to 677,745 in the same week of 2019. Transport Canada announced on Tuesday that it will lift the months-long ban on direct flights from India starting Sept. 26 at 11:59 p.m. EDT, with enhanced screening measures in place upon arrival.

Now what? Rachel Aiello CTVNews.ca Ottawa News Bureau Online Producer @rachaiello Contact Published Tuesday, September 21, 2021 2:55PM EDT Last Updated Wednesday, September 22, 2021 10:50AM EDT Share: Reddit Share Text: OTTAWA -- When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the 2021 federal election, he said it was because he thought Canadians should have their say about where the country is going. Well, voters have spoken, and it’s another minority Liberal government. With an almost identical House of Commons heading to Ottawa in terms of seat distribution, are Canadians in for more of the same? Or, could the outcome of this election result in consequential political changes, with leaders now facing post-election questions about their futures? Here’s where things stand on the day after the 44th General Election. As of 4:30 p.m. EDT, CTV News’ Decision Desk has the Liberals leading and elected in 158 ridings, the Conservatives in 119 ridings, the Bloc Quebecois in 34, the NDP in 25, and the Greens in two. Heading into this race the Liberals held 155 seats, the Conservatives held 119, the Bloc Quebecois 32, the NDP 24, the Green Party had two, and there were five Independent MPs and one vacancy. All told, should the current seat count hold that means: The Liberals have gained two seats, as one elected MP under the party banner will be sitting as an independent; The Conservatives did not pick up more seats despite winning the popular vote and defeating a trio of cabinet ministers in part due to the People’s Party of Canada pulling support away; The Bloc may end up two seats ahead of where they were last month while the NDP are largely in the same spot, perhaps one seat ahead depending on outstanding too-close-to-call races; and While the Greens will be returning the same number of MPs, this time one of them is from Ontario and it’s not Green Leader Annamie Paul. “It was a bit like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, you know when he wakes up and smashes his alarm clock and finds out, it's the same day again? I think perhaps today there's some Canadians who are smashing their alarm clock, because the results look very similar to the 2019 election,” said CTV News’ official pollster and Founder of Nanos Research, Nik Nanos on CTV News Channel on Tuesday morning. Next steps in terms of getting the 44th Parliament up and running will include Trudeau appointing a new cabinet, the House of Commons electing a Speaker and determining the parameters of returning to Parliament in a fourth wave, and then presenting a Throne Speech. While these are some of the certainties of the post-election phase, potentially consequential uncertainties remain. Will this be Trudeau's last election? Trudeau took a gamble hoping to cash in on Canadians’ positive sentiments for the Liberals’ handling of the COVID-19 crisis and vaccine rollout when he called the federal election on Aug. 15. In doing so, he pulled the plug two years into his first minority government, sending Canadians to the polls in a costly federal vote, while putting on the line some key policy proposals like childcare that could have gone up in smoke had the outcome been different, in hopes of being rewarded with a relatively unchallenged four year majority reign. Full transcript: Justin Trudeau says Canadians have chosen 'a progressive plan' in victory speech Now, the Liberals will once again have to find dance partners in other opposition parties—most likely the Bloc and NDP— to pass key legislation and stay afloat. Despite being in largely the same place electorally as they were before the campaign kicked off, Trudeau suggested in his victory speech on election night that what Canadians have sent him back to Ottawa with was a “clear mandate.” “I hear you when you say that you just want to get back to the things you love, not worry about this pandemic, or about an election. That you just want to know that your members of Parliament of all stripes will have your back through this crisis, and beyond,” he said. While he does not currently have a post-election media availability scheduled, once he does come before a microphone Trudeau will likely have to address the outcome, and speak to questions he dodged leading up to election day as to whether this election will be his last as leader. “Ultimately, the decision comes down to him. The party bylaws allow him to continue to [lead], whereas the other parties all have leadership reviews coming up for not winning government. So it's really his decision where he wants to take his legacy, right? Whether it's a year, two years, or four years and takes it to the next election,” said Liberal strategist and 2019 Liberal election staffer Muhammad Ali in an interview on CTV News Channel on Tuesday. “He has a lot of work ahead of him, so I think that's where his focus is on right now, and not on whether he's going to stay on as prime minister or not.” O'Toole triggers 'post-election review' Despite high hopes from supporters who were buoyed by competitive polling numbers throughout the campaign, O’Toole did not deliver on his promise to pick up seats across the country after running as a more progressive leader than he presented himself to be during his 2020 leadership race. “The Conservatives overall were a wash. They picked up in Atlantic Canada and then lost in other regions,” said Nanos. Will he now be facing a challenge to his continued leadership, as his predecessor Andrew Scheer faced after a similar election outcome in 2019? In his speech on election night, O’Toole spoke about being the leader to take on the Liberals whenever the next election may come, but that decision will likely ultimately be made by party membership. Full transcript: Erin O'Toole applauds Conservative gains in his speech, says there's more work to do On Tuesday, O’Toole said he was disappointed by the outcome but didn’t speak to the rumblings about his leadership. Instead, he announced that he has initiated a “post-election review to examine what went right, what went wrong, and what we can do better to win in 18 months,” referring to a suggestion that Trudeau’s next snap election call may be just around the corner. Going forward, Nanos said that: “There’s going to need to be some soul searching,” within the party. “Is the party socially conservative or socially progressive? What's the future of the party, and how are they going to manage the People's Party of Canada?” Nanos said. Conservative strategist and former member of Andrew Scheer’s 2019 election campaign communications team, Jamie Ellerton, said O’Toole’s has a shot at staying at the helm, but some key things will have to fall into place in the coming days and weeks. “If you do not see other prominent caucus members coming out and talking vigorously in defence of the leader, that's sign number one that Erin O'Toole is in trouble. Number two is, I think, Erin needs to kind of learn some of the mistakes of what Andrew Scheer did last time, and actually have a real accounting for what went wrong with this campaign and level with Canadians and the party specifically as to how he's going to fix those issues going forward,” he said. Will New Democrats stick with Leader Jagmeet Singh? Running a diverse candidate roster, the party hoped to win more seats than it did in 2019 when it was dealt a major blow, losing 20 of the 44 seats it previously held. It was the party’s worst showing in more than a decade, but still the party stuck with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Now, the party is in relatively the same spot despite having far more name recognition, an aggressive social media strategy, and after campaigning hard on what New Democrats were able to negotiate in the last minority Parliament. Asked what he thinks went wrong during a Tuesday morning press conference, Singh said he was proud of his showing, and indicated he isn’t worried New Democrats would be looking for a new leader. In contrast, NDP members voted against former leader Tom Mulcair following his 2015 election showing, which had the party hold nearly twice as many seats. Asked why Singh remains so confident, he said it was because he ran a campaign that “our party and our members are really proud of.” “We're not looking for ways to force an election, we think that's not the goal, and Canadians sent us a clear message, they want us to continue working. They want us to get back to work,” Singh said. “Despite our number, we were the most successful opposition party in the last Parliament, and this Parliament looks pretty much the same.” On CTV News Channel, NDP strategist and former B.C. NDP senior executive Nikki Hill suggested that “nobody’s talking” about ditching Singh as leader. And, will the country be forced to do this all again before too long? Minority governments can be unpredictable. While the next fixed election date isn’t for another four years, as has just been witnessed, typically minority governments don’t last more than two years. Whether the governing party triggers another vote, or they are brought down on a confidence vote, there’s a chance Canadians could be heading back to the polls before too long. How soon that could happen is very much an open question. A few things to keep in mind: Party standings can fluctuate. If a member is removed from caucus for one reason or another, crosses the floor, resigns their seat, or dies, then the balance of who holds the firmest grip on power could evolve over time; The prospect of avoiding another pandemic election may continue to be a motivating factor for the opposition parties to prop up the Liberals; and If there are leadership changes afoot, or parties are tapped out financially, they may not be in a position to go back to the polls on strong footing, incentivizing the need to make the minority Parliament work.

The team at Hamilton General invited CTV News inside the tense ICU in the hopes of giving Canadians a look at the reality they go through every week as Delta cases climb. “I think it's important for Canadians to see that this is real,” Dr. Sunjay Sharma, medical director of critical care, told CTV News. “None of these people thought two months ago they would end up here. And now they're here. And some of them won’t survive.” Inside this ICU, on the day of CTV’s visit, 30 per cent of the 45 beds are COVID-19 patients fighting for their lives, most of them infected recently. And every person that was admitted during the fourth wave declined vaccination or just didn’t get around to it before they fell ill. “It’s crazy people don’t believe it,” Sharma said. “We come to work every day. This is real. It’s like someone telling you the sky is not blue.” Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox They want those who don’t believe the risk of COVID-19 is real to see the enormous strain that this work is having on health care workers, who are already exhausted from almost two years of fighting. The unvaccinated COVID-19 patients this hospital is seeing are younger and healthier, in their 30s and 40s. Many them require a specialized form of life support called ECMO, in which their blood is removed to be given oxygen and pumped back into the body because their lungs have failed. It’s the “highest level of life support you can get anywhere,” Sharma said. He pointed out a patient in his 40s, who is hooked up to an ECMO machine. “There's a catheter the size of a garden hose in his neck, and there's a catheter the size of a garden hose [at his] groin,” Sharma said. “And basically it takes the blood out of his groin, puts it the machine, takes the carbon dioxide out, [puts in] the oxygen, and then comes back into his heart.” Most of the patients who are on ECMO with COVID-19 don’t have significant co-morbidities. “It’s scary. It’s people younger than me, in some cases healthier than me,” Sharma said. Only four hospitals in Ontario offer ECMO support. Toronto General is one of the four, and told CTV News that they have 13 COVID-19 patients on ECMO currently, all of whom are unvaccinated. And it’s not only happening in Ontario. Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, tweeted Wednesday that of the 218 COVID-19 patients who are in ICU in the province, 92.3 per cent are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. There are several million Canadians who are not vaccinated, some who have chosen not to get even one dose of the vaccine. Some may have legitimate medical exemptions. But there are others who refuse saying the vaccines don't work, they aren't safe, that COVID-19 itself is a hoax. Health workers who see patients stricken with the virus every day know it is no hoax and say that across the country hospitals and ICU's are slowing filling up with patients — almost all of whom are unvaccinated. The fourth wave is a wave almost entirely among those who have not gotten their shot, they say. At Hamilton General, all of the COVID-19 patients in the ICU are unvaccinated, and eight are on ECMO. Dr. Faizan Amin, medical director of the ECMO unit, said he hoped seeing into the situation in the hospital would change some minds. “Some of the viewers that have those beliefs will be able to watch this on TV, and there is nothing unreal about these people, they’re real life people, they’re real fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters — real human beings and they're getting very sick,” Amin said. A month ago, this ICU had just one COVID-19 patient. Now they have 14 -- and four-to-five requests a week to accept more patients from other hospitals who need more intensive care. And as the ICU fills up with COVID-19 victims and other patients suffering from urgent issues such as strokes, heart attacks and physical trauma, other surgeries get cancelled. “This ICU serves cardiac surgery, or surgery and trauma, vascular surgery, stroke. It is the regional hospital for all of this region for 2.5 million people,” Sharma said, adding that around 15 other hospitals frequently send patients here if they need a higher level of care. THE VACCINE STRUGGLE Some COVID-19 patients have expressed regret once they understand the magnitude of their situation. Erin, an ICU nurse who asked us not to use her last name, told CTV News that “a lot of people have been asking for vaccines, right before they get intubated. But it’s too late.” But some skeptics don’t change their mind even when on the edge of death, she reported, adding that some who have been on ECMO and recovered still say there isn’t enough research about the vaccines that would’ve likely prevented their own suffering. “There is a small subset of people that we're still seeing who feel that this is not a real disease, or it's not as dangerous as some people are making it out to be — but the reality is in front of our eyes,” Amin said. One of the patients who has been on ECMO in Hamilton General for the longest period of time is a patient in his 30s who has been in the hospital for months — he fell ill before he was able to be vaccinated because it hadn’t been opened up to his age group yet. Unlike the COVID-19 patients coming into the ICU this month, “he did not have a choice,” Sharma said. The man has been totally healthy before he contracted COVID-19, Sharma said. Health care workers are dedicated to giving everyone the best care possible, but it is frustrating seeing patients who didn’t need to be suffering to this degree, they say. “To know that their families didn't have to go through that and the patients didn't have to go through that, if they just got [a shot] that takes 30 seconds,” Sharma said. “It's frustrating, and you just can't understand the rationale behind why you wouldn't get a vaccine. “We see this every day — this is where you end up when you don’t.” Sharma said that when they have patients who are unvaccinated, their family members often change their own minds about vaccination after seeing their loved one suffer. “Many of the family members of people who are here and are unvaccinated, after seeing their family members here for a week, get vaccinated,” he said. “It's unfortunate that it's taken sort of that experience to change some behaviours,” Amin said. Sharma is not only frustrated with the individuals, but with the larger machine of misinformation that leads people to be confused about vaccines and what is best for their health. “It's anger with the social contract that got them into this situation, it is anger of people posting on social media that COVID-19 is not real, or that vaccines don’t work,” Sharma said. “That basically preys on vulnerable people, that makes them make bad decisions that lands them up here.” Seventy-eight per cent of eligible Canadians have been fully vaccinated. Side effects are rare according to public health officials as are breakthrough COVID-19 cases, and vaccines have been proven to drastically minimize severe cases of COVID-19 as well as death in the event of a breakthrough case. And yet, in this fourth wave, we’ve seen a baffling level of animosity displayed towards health care workers from a small subset of people, ranging from anti-vaccine groups protesting outside of hospitals to individual health care workers receiving threats. A year ago, it went unquestioned that health care workers were heroes. But now some groups are looking for someone to blame. “This morning I got some angry phone calls from people in the public because of my advocacy for vaccines,” Sharma said. He said it’s not only frustrating, but personally insulting that people would think that he’s taking time away from his family not to take care of sick patients but to prop up some lie about the virus. ""I have two young kids who I went for weeks without seeing, because I was here [at the hospital],” he said. “I don’t think that there's any motivation for healthcare workers to lie.” Nurses told CTV News that they know colleagues who have been spat on by protestors, booed. “They think it’s a hoax and that honestly is a slap in the face to us after everything that we've been doing,” said Erin. A HEALTH CARE HOUSE OF CARDS That animosity is one more burden for health care workers during this fourth wave, on top of increasing burnout and short staffing. Amin pointed out that when the third wave hit in the spring, it put more pressure on the health care system than had occurred in a year of COVID-19. “We've been going at this in full gear for 18 months, and working that hard for that long for all the healthcare providers here that are looking after these patients, it's very difficult,” he said. Michael Plaunt, clinical manager of the coronary care unit at Hamilton General, told CTV News that everyone is tired. “They're burnt out, they're exhausted,” he said. “At the beginning, we didn't have any way to prevent this. And now that we have a way to prevent this, we should be seeing that improve, and we're not. So that's the frustration.” Health care workers say the circumstances of many of these fourth wave cases eats away at the compassion that is integral to their work. “We will come in in the middle of the night to take care of a sick patient, no matter the time of day or the day of the week,” Amin said. “But when it's an easily preventable situation, you start to start to lose some of the empathy. And that's a key factor of what we do as healthcare providers — we are empathetic and compassionate and you want to continue being that way.” Medical staff are becoming clearly fatigued, in more ways than one. At Hamilton General alone, around 12 staff members have left their job between the third and fourth waves. “The system is cracking,” Amin said. “The fourth wave is in many ways worse than the third wave. Although the number of cases in the community are not as high as we were seeing in the third wave, the amount of resources we have left within the healthcare system are much less now than they were in the third wave because of things like burnout and exit of staff members.” He pointed out that because of the burden on the health care system from COVID-19 patients, those who are getting ill from other diseases and conditions are having their care further delayed because of mostly preventable COVID-19 cases. Health care workers are urging those who are still on the fence about vaccination to get their shots. “I don’t think we are at the crest of the fourth wave,” said Sharma. “I think the wave is building. I think it’s going to get worse.” And if health care workers don’t get a moment to breathe soon, it could mean big problems not just for COVID-19 patients, but everyone. “I don't think a wise thing would be to push those people again to the max, because we still have a healthcare system to run after COVID is over,” Sharma said. “And I think we can't lose sight of that.” RELATED IMAGES view larger image A third of the beds in this ICU in Hamilton General are taken up by COVID-19 patients, most of whom are in their 30s and 40s, and all unvaccinated.

The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal had earlier ruled Ottawa had ""wilfully"" and ""recklessly"" discriminated against Indigenous children by knowingly underfunding child and family services on reserve. In September 2019, it ordered the federal government to pay $40,000, the maximum the tribunal can award, to each First Nations child removed from their home after 2006, as well as to their parents, because of the discrimination. It was estimated that around 54,000 children and their parents could be eligible to receive compensation, which would likely cost the federal government more than $2 billion. The second legal battle stems from a separate ruling in 2020 that expanded the scope of Jordan's Principle, which is a rule stating when there is jurisdictional disagreement over what level of government should provide a service to First Nations children, Ottawa takes on the responsibility and worries about the costs second. The tribunal ruled the principle should apply to children who are members of a First Nation even though they don't have status under the Indian Act as well as kids whose parents are eligible for status when they are not. ""No one can seriously doubt that First Nations people are amongst the most disadvantaged and marginalized members of Canadian society,"" Federal Court Justice Paul Favel wrote in his decision released Wednesday. ""The Tribunal was aware of this and reasonably attempted to remedy the discrimination while being attentive to the very different positions of the parties."" Favel found that the government failed to establish that either of the tribunal's decisions were unreasonable. ""In my view, the procedural history of this case has demonstrated that there is, and has been, good will resulting in significant movements toward remedying this unprecedented discrimination. However, the good work of the parties is unfinished,"" Favel wrote. ""The parties must decide whether they will continue to sit beside the trail or move forward in this spirit of reconciliation."" Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, which is one of the parties fighting for Indigenous children to be compensated, said the judicial reviews Ottawa launched took direct aim at central calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada regarding child welfare and Jordan's Principle. ""This is the moment for Canadians, with the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation tomorrow and knowing that these are some of the top calls to action, to get ahold of their elected officials and say, 'put down your sword.""' ""They have been fighting this case against First Nations kids to get equitable services and their families to get help to recover from the residential school trauma for now 14-and-a-half years ΓÇª the Canadian people are now at a place where they want to see the TRC calls to action realized."" The parties have 30 days to appeal Favel's ruling. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said the government is reviewing the Federal Court's decision. ""Canada remains committed to compensating First Nations children who were removed from their families and communities and to continue implementing significant reform of the First Nation Child and Family Services Program, recognizing that class actions have been filed, including by the Assembly of First Nations and Moushoom,"" Miller said in an emailed statement. Miller said that Jordan's Principle continues to ensure that First Nations children can access the products, services and supports they need when they need them. He said the government continues to work with Indigenous governing bodies to implement an Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis children, youth and families, under which First Nations are enabled to exercise their jurisdiction in relation to child and family services and make decisions in the best interest of their children. ""These are important steps in redressing the intergenerational impacts of colonization."" Blackstock said the work has been done to set up a system to provide payments to First Nations children and their families who are eligible to be compensated. ""We're ready, as soon as the federal government puts down its sword and stops fighting these kids,"" she said. Opposition parties and Indigenous leaders have criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's decision to fight both of these rulings, saying that's not the appropriate course of action for a government committed to reconciliation. ""Today was an absolute victory for First Nation children. For six years Justin Trudeau spent millions fighting the rights of Indigenous children and trying to overturn a ruling that found his government guilty of 'wilful and reckless' discrimination against vulnerable Indigenous kids. The court has thrown his case out,"" NDP MP Charlie Angus said in a statement Wednesday. He called for the government to immediately end its legal battle in the matter and focus on closing funding gaps and chronic denial of services to First Nations children. ""Given that tomorrow is the first-ever National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, it is imperative that the federal government finally take clear steps towards truth, justice and reconciliation for all Indigenous people in Canada,"" he wrote.

According to Canada Border Services Agency data, between Sept. 6 and Sept. 12, 95,381 foreign nationals who were travelling by commercial air landed in Canada, compared to 79,886 the week prior. The government announced in July that anyone fully vaccinated with one of Health Canada’s approved vaccines would be able to enter the country for discretionary purposes as of Sept. 7, so long as they abided by additional COVID-19 screening measures. Travellers must have received the “full series,” or a combination of vaccines, 14 days prior to departure, submitted that information on the ArriveCAN app or on the equivalent website, provided a molecular test result taken no more than 72 hours before their scheduled departure flight, and taken another test upon arrival. Commercial air traveller volume by foreign nationals hovered around the 70,000 through most of August and between 15,000 to 45,000 per week in June and July. The August increase correlates with Canada opening its doors to fully vaccinated Americans for non-essential purposes. At the same time, several airports, including Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport and Quebec City Jean Lesage International Airport, began once again receiving international flights. While there was a slight increase in arrivals between Sept. 6 to Sept. 12, the higher traveller volume is still nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. More than 326,000 foreign nationals arrived in Canada during the same week in 2019. All total, international traveller volume – including Canadians – sat at 209,838, compared to 677,745 in the same week of 2019. Transport Canada announced on Tuesday that it will lift the months-long ban on direct flights from India starting Sept. 26 at 11:59 p.m. EDT, with enhanced screening measures in place upon arrival.

Brooklyn Neustaeter CTVNews.ca Writer @bneustaeter Contact Published Thursday, October 7, 2021 2:29PM EDT Last Updated Thursday, October 7, 2021 3:34PM EDT Share: Reddit Share Text: TORONTO -- With many companies making remote work a permanent aspect of certain jobs, experts say employers cannot reduce a current employee's salary without consent and face legal risks if they do. However, employers can hire new, remote employees at lower wages, if they so desire. Stephen Wolpert, a partner at Canadian employment law firm Whitten & Lublin, told CTVNews.ca an employer can change an employee's pay if both parties agree to the reduction. ""If they're both onside with the changes … there's no real hurdle to that. The harder question is when an employer is sort of imposing it on an employee unilaterally, without the employee having agreed or without the employee having acknowledged that working remotely is a benefit to them,"" Wolpert said in a telephone interview Thursday. In those cases, Wolpert said, an employer can still reduce wages without an employee having agreed, but it comes with a ""real risk"" that the reduction will qualify as a constructive dismissal of that worker's employment, which can entitle them to severance. Constructive dismissal, Wolpert said, is when an employer makes a substantial change to the terms of an employee’s employment without consent, resulting in the employee having the option of treating their employment as having been terminated. However, what the courts deem as constructive dismissal is ""relative,"" he said. ""If it's a one-per-cent reduction in wages, that might not be seen as a constructive dismissal. If it's a 20-per-cent reduction in wages, that probably would be,"" Wolpert said. ""The courts would look at all kinds of different things to decide how big a pay cut could be tolerated before it's a constructive dismissal."" While imposing a pay cut to existing employees poses a legal risk to employers, Wolpert said they do have the option to ""red circle"" someone's salary. ""In other words, you don't reduce it, but you make an internal decision that you're not going to increase it for some period of time,"" he said. ""And that's usually permissible, because most employees aren't entitled to wage increases.' Howard Levitt, an employment lawyer at Levitt LLP, said employers also have the option to hire new employees at lower rates if they are planning to have them work from home full-time. ""They can hire 10 employees at 10 different rates for the same jobs quite legally,"" Levitt said in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Thursday. However, he said employers have to give current employees the option of returning to the office at full pay. ""If [companies] want to have a policy that people working at home will earn less, they can have that policy as long as they give the people who were previously at the higher salary the option of keeping their higher salary,"" Levitt said While working remotely eliminated the costs of commuting and running an office space, Christopher Achkar, principal and employment lawyer at Toronto-based firm Achkar Law, told CTVNews.ca that employers have to take into account the new costs facing an employee working from home, such as increased electricity bills, as well as personal phone and internet usage. ""These are things that now that employee will have to bear the cost on those, and the employer is getting a windfall essentially,"" Achkar said in a telephone interview Thursday. If an employer does try to reduce a current employee's wages, Achkar said the employee should ""make it clear"" that they are refusing the change if a mutual agreement has not been met. He added that if the employer comes back and says, ""too bad, take it or leave it,"" that is grounds for constructive dismissal and the worker should speak with an employment lawyer about compensation. ""What the employee should not do is not say anything about the decrease in pay and think that later on they can bring it up again,"" Achkar said. ""Once you accept a change in employment, like pay, then it will be hard to go back on it."" RELATED IMAGES view larger image A woman works remotely in this stock image.

Oct. 21 is the deadline for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to declare whether it plans to ease these travel restrictions at the Canada-U.S. land border, or extend the prohibition for another 30 days. No one knows for sure why the U.S. has kept the land border closed while Canadians can still fly into the country by air, but Toronto travel insurance broker Martin Firestone says he is telling his clients to have faith that it will reopen come October. ""There's going to be thousands and thousands of snowbirds that will for a second year in a row not find their way down south if it doesn't because it's going to curtail the season once again,"" Firestone told CTV News Channel on Wednesday. Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox Read more: U.S. easing virus restrictions for foreign flights to America As more Americans and Canadians get vaccinated, the Canadian Snowbirds Association (CSA) says it is hopeful the vast majority of snowbirds will be able to travel south this winter. Evan Rachkovsky, a spokesperson for the CSA, told CTVNews.ca in an email that Canadian snowbirds are itching to return to the U.S., but the current ban is hampering their plans once again. ""As over 70 per cent of Canadian snowbirds travel to the United States in their Canadian vehicles, the ongoing closure of the U.S. land border continues to cause frustration amongst these travellers,"" Rachkovsky said Wednesday. He added that snowbirds who live in their RVs year round are particularly impacted since most Canadian campgrounds and RV sites are closed during the winter months. ""The CSA is calling on the Biden Administration to lift the current restrictions at the land border as the Canadian government did for fully vaccinated American travellers earlier this year,"" Rachkovsky said. The Canadian government eased travel restriction for U.S. citizens and permanent residents fully immunized against COVID-19 on Aug. 9. The Biden administration announced in September that most adult foreign nationals will have to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to travel to the United States by early November. However, there were no details provided on how this new policy would specifically impact travel at the land border. Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas previously said during a National Press Club event in Washington that the U.S. had hoped to ease land travel restrictions sooner, but the Delta variant delayed those plans. If the land border remains closed come Oct. 21, Firestone said Canadian snowbirds do have some options, ""all of which are expensive."" Firestone says older travellers typically want a vehicle at their disposal or an RV while in the U.S., and prefer to avoid the hassle of air travel, particularly since Canada's decision to allow fully-vaccinated visitors has dramatically slowed the customs clearance process. ""Why two people from the same family packing up their car and heading south across the border is not considered safer than going into an airport terminal with a thousand other people… is beyond any understanding,"" Firestone said. However, Firestone said the cost of shipping a vehicle or an RV separately while paying for plane tickets is too expensive for most snowbirds. In addition, a shortage of available rental cars across North America has put a further premium on being able to take one's own car. He says those who can't afford these options will likely remain in Canada for the winter season. ""Yes there are choices, but I don't think any [snowbirds] will take advantage of them if they need to have to do that,"" Firestone said. A group of U.S. Senate Democrats, including Michigan senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, Sen. Kirsten Gillebrand of New York and New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, wrote a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden in September asking him to finally lift the travel ban. ""We believe that fully vaccinated Canadians should be allowed to safely travel into the United States via land ports of entry,"" reads the letter, which was also signed by New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""We urge you to lift these restrictions before October, provide a plan for reopening land ports of entry and appoint an interagency lead on U.S.-Canadian border restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the senators said in the letter. Firestone says the U.S. may be looking to open its northern and southern borders at the same time, however, the ongoing immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border may be making the White House wary about easing travel restrictions altogether. ""I suspect that [America] wants an open border between their north and southern countries with respect to opening it simultaneously,"" he said.

The news is the first clear indication from the Biden administration that it is preparing to ease travel restrictions first imposed in March 2020, at the outset of the pandemic. Details, however, remain in short supply. It is not clear, for instance, how the new policy will specifically impact travel at the Canada-U.S. land border, where non-essential visitors remain prohibited from crossing. That specific prohibition is being extended another 30 days until Oct. 21, a White House official said. The other burning question is whether Canadians who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has never been approved for use in the U.S., will meet the eligibility test. New York congressman Brian Higgins, long one of the most vocal Capitol Hill critics of travel restrictions with Canada, said it's long past time the U.S. began allowing recreational visits from Canada. ""It is welcome news that the White House is making progress on reciprocating international public health measures to protect air travellers,"" Higgins said in a statement. ""Yet it is inexplicable that no announcement on easing travel restrictions at land ports of entry is being made today since the livelihoods of communities across the northern border depend on cross-border commerce."" The White House says the forthcoming new rules will apply to air travel and require passengers to show proof of vaccination before boarding, as well as a negative COVID-19 test no more than three days old. In that respect, they are similar to the rules Canada began imposing over the summer -- initially on returning Canadians, then on U.S. citizens and permanent residents, then finally on all foreign nationals. More stringent testing and quarantine requirements will also be put in place for unvaccinated travellers when the new rules take effect in November.
