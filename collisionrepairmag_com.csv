The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.

Niagara, Ontario — In January, Thorold Auto Parts owner Frank Serravalle beamed with pride when he opened up his mail. The auto recycling facility had received plaques celebrating his winning of several readers’ choice awards from the St. Catharines Standard, in 2019. The paper’s readers have named Thorold Auto Parts as the diamond winner in the auto parts and accessories, and oil and lube service categories, as well as the gold winner in the auto service centre and tire sales and service categories. Serravalle’s team couldn’t resist sharing their boss’s look of glee with the business’s social media followers. “Well, These showed up in the mail a little while ago! Before they go on the wall we Just wanted to thank all those who voted us to be Gold and Diamond Winners in 4 categories for 2019 Readers Choice Awards!!” the team wrote on the company’s Facebook page. “We truly appreciate all the support! Don’t know where we’d be without all of you! ” It is not the first major award Serravalle’s business has won. In 2018 the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce celebrated Thorold Auto Parts committment to the environment with an environmental leadership award. The business was also shortlisted for a similar award in St. Catharines Standard in 2017. In 2017, Thorold Auto Parts was also one of two auto recycling yards to host delegates to that year’s International Roundtable on Auto Recycling.
