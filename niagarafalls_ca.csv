Construction hoarding has been erected around the development site, and the deteriorated Sylvia Place Market structure has been taken down to make way for this new community asset. To mark the beginning of construction of The Exchange, the City held a virtual, COVID friendly, groundbreaking and have produced a short video to celebrate this milestone. The new culture hub and market, designed by DTAH, will become a vibrant centre of activity in the community by providing shared spaces where artists, musicians, food vendors and patrons, and local businesses can come together and create. Located in the historic Main and Ferry district, it will include a large culture and market hall, café, artist studios, and creative workshop surrounded by two multi-functional civic plazas that interconnect the flanking streets. The Market Hall, which will house the regularly scheduled Farmers’ Market, will be a space for other events that include music, theatre, lectures and other weekend markets. Located adjacent to the Niagara Falls History Museum, the site is knit together with a design language that prioritizes an accessible public realm, and creates quality indoor and outdoor space that is durable, flexible, and sustainable. The project name - Niagara Falls Exchange (NFX), speaks to the rich exchange of ideas and creativity that is anticipated to occur on site and between the arts and culture, food and farming communities of Niagara Falls.

Construction hoarding has been erected around the development site, and the deteriorated Sylvia Place Market structure has been taken down to make way for this new community asset. To mark the beginning of construction of The Exchange, the City held a virtual, COVID friendly, groundbreaking and have produced a short video to celebrate this milestone. The new culture hub and market, designed by DTAH, will become a vibrant centre of activity in the community by providing shared spaces where artists, musicians, food vendors and patrons, and local businesses can come together and create. Located in the historic Main and Ferry district, it will include a large culture and market hall, café, artist studios, and creative workshop surrounded by two multi-functional civic plazas that interconnect the flanking streets. The Market Hall, which will house the regularly scheduled Farmers’ Market, will be a space for other events that include music, theatre, lectures and other weekend markets. Located adjacent to the Niagara Falls History Museum, the site is knit together with a design language that prioritizes an accessible public realm, and creates quality indoor and outdoor space that is durable, flexible, and sustainable. The project name - Niagara Falls Exchange (NFX), speaks to the rich exchange of ideas and creativity that is anticipated to occur on site and between the arts and culture, food and farming communities of Niagara Falls.

(January 11, 2021) – The YMCA of Niagara has made the difficult decision to permanently close the Niagara Falls YMCA, located in the MacBain Community Centre, effective immediately. The location, which opened in 2005, has been temporarily closed since mid-March when the YMCA of Niagara shut down all five of its health, fitness and aquatics centres, in accordance with government directives related to the pandemic. YMCA leadership has been reviewing operations of all centres since the spring and has taken a phased approach to reopening individual locations based on safety, local community interest in YMCA programming, and financial viability. YMCA health, fitness and aquatics locations in St. Catharines, Niagara West (Grimsby), Port Colborne and Welland had reopened for a period of time prior to the most recent provincial lockdown on December 26, 2020. YMCA members from the Niagara Falls location have been contacted individually via email today. The economic impact of the pandemic has had a devastating impact on YMCAs across the country including the YMCA of Niagara. The Niagara Falls location was already experiencing significant membership losses prior to the pandemic and YMCA projections indicate membership numbers will continue to decline. Relative to the size of the community, delivering YMCA programs and services in a facility as large as the MacBain Community Centre is no longer economically sustainable. “We are saddened that this closure will affect many members, staff and supporters in the community who have been part of our YMCA family for many years,” said Mike Watt, Chair of YMCA of Niagara’s Board of Directors. “However, as a responsible charity with very limited reserves, we cannot compromise our long-term ability to serve Niagara by continuing to operate facilities that are not financially viable. We are very appreciative of our partnership with the City of Niagara Falls and remain committed to the Niagara Falls community.” Mayor Jim Diodati stated that “The YMCA at MacBain Community Centre has been a cornerstone of our community for the past 15 years. Thousands of people have learned to swim in the pool, improved their fitness at classes, brought their kids to programs and enjoyed connecting with their neighbours there. The City has had a long and positive partnership with the YMCA, and City staff and Council worked hard with YMCA leadership to find a mutually beneficial way for services to continue, but in the end, there was no financially viable way to do so.” The Mayor added, “Reinvention is about recognizing change and making a decision to adapt. In the near future, the City of Niagara Falls will be entertaining Expressions of Interest (EOI) for new opportunities to utilize the former YMCA space in this City-owned facility, which includes the pool, gymnasium, fitness studios, racquet courts and indoor track.” The YMCA of Niagara will continue to operate programs and services in licensed child care, camp, community outreach, employment and immigrant services in other locations in Niagara Falls, and will continue to explore new, sustainable ways to provide YMCA health and fitness programs locally and throughout the region. Unfortunately, this closure will impact a number of staff and we hope to have the opportunity to rehire staff in the future as we consider new opportunities to reactivate programs and services. About the YMCA of Niagara The YMCA of Niagara is a powerful association of people joined together by a shared passion to foster a sense of belonging for all. In an age of complex social challenges, the YMCA is steadfastly dedicated to building healthy communities by inviting and encouraging Canadians to join in, to give back, and to gain the connections, skills, and confidence they need to thrive. Our focus on inclusiveness and accessibility means we serve people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities through all stages of life.

Many residents in our community face continued financial hardships due to the pandemic and Council was determined that the budget remain affordable, while ensuring the ability to maintain the essential services residents and businesses depend on every day. Council was able to reach a compromise that will allow the City to provide the services our citizens expect, without sacrificing the future to do so. The budget limits the municipal tax increase to 1.7%, amounting to an extra $23.75 annual increase for the average residential household ($279,854). The actual tax bill for each property owner will depend on the assessed value of the property. These estimates also reflect the City’s portion of taxes only – a property owner’s tax bill also includes school taxes, and impacts from Region of Niagara services, including waste management. The increase compares favourable with average household and commercial taxes, and tax increases, in other Niagara municipalities. Council approved the recommended budget changes and the other mitigation options outlined in the presentation by Finance Director Tiffany Clark, as well as the overall annual operating budget increase of $23.75 to the average residential household for 2021. Council also redefined the Ontario Lottery & Gaming (OLG) priorities to exclude property tax relief and committed to a strategy of reducing the OLG tax subsidy by 50% of the new taxation growth per year beginning in 2022 with those funds to be converted to future capital investments. The service level decision regarding the indoor aquatics centre at MacBain Community Centre was deferred until such time as staff has had an opportunity to review the results of the expressions of interest and report back to Council in March. All final budget documents will be available at niagarafalls.ca/budget For more information, contact: Tiffany Clark Director of Finance, City of Niagara Falls [email protected] Posted on: 2/9/2021 9:14 PM - Category: Media Releases Return to News Site Information Contact Us Address City of Niagara Falls 4310 Queen Street Niagara Falls, ON Canada L2E 6X5 905-356-7521 Connect Let's Talk Niagara Falls Sign up for Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram Vimeo Videos YouTube City Sites Business Development Coronation Centre Gale Centre MacBain Community Centre Niagara Falls History Museum Niagara Falls Tourism Resources Employment Opportunities Weather Accessibility Privacy Policy Site Map Terms & Conditions"

The RFP invites proposals for a partner to enter into a long-term lease for the operations of the airport, located in the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. “The Niagara District Airport continues to be a valuable asset to the transportation and tourism infrastructure of Niagara,” stated Robin Garrett, Chair of the Niagara District Airport Commission. “To continue to grow the facility, and better support our communities, we are moving forward with a process to identify a partner who shares the same vision for Niagara: a thriving, international tourism hub, where quality of life is enhanced by expanding our connectivity within Canada and beyond.” The airport, opened in 1929, is currently operated by the NDAC, including the City of St. Catharines, the City of Niagara Falls, and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The process has been initiated to identify a third-partner operator who can support the capital investments necessary to ensure the long-term success of the airport, continue to establish a niche in the air sector across Ontario, and further enhance the value of the airport to the economic development of business in Niagara. “The operation of a healthy, growing and fully-supported airport is a crucial aspect of a transportation and development plan for any city or region,” Garrett added. “We are thankful that Niagara boasts an airport that has been supported for 92 years; however, for it to fully reach its potential, and for the region to leverage it, we need a partner to direct the operations and manage the investment in the facility.” All documents relating to the RFP can be found on MERX and Bonfire at https://procurementoffice.bonfirehub.ca/opportunities/40815. “Growing economies, growing communities, and growing businesses all rely on access,” stated Dan Pilon, CEO of the Niagara District Airport. “Airports continue to connect people, continue to move products, and continue to be a significant part of Niagara. We look forward to finding a third-party who feels as optimistic regarding the growth of our airport as we do.” Through this partnership, the NDAC seeks to improve the airport’s competitiveness and efficiency, while reducing municipal investment in airport operations and maintaining public safety and security. The partner would facilitate increased infrastructure investments, demonstrate the willingness to strategically grow targeted route development, and shape the airport’s role in connecting with community partners. For members of the public with additional questions, a list of answers to Frequently Asked Questions has been compiled and can be found at http://www.niagaradistrictairport.ca/faq, and is linked directly off the main page of our website.

The RFP invites proposals for a partner to enter into a long-term lease for the operations of the airport, located in the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. “The Niagara District Airport continues to be a valuable asset to the transportation and tourism infrastructure of Niagara,” stated Robin Garrett, Chair of the Niagara District Airport Commission. “To continue to grow the facility, and better support our communities, we are moving forward with a process to identify a partner who shares the same vision for Niagara: a thriving, international tourism hub, where quality of life is enhanced by expanding our connectivity within Canada and beyond.” The airport, opened in 1929, is currently operated by the NDAC, including the City of St. Catharines, the City of Niagara Falls, and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The process has been initiated to identify a third-partner operator who can support the capital investments necessary to ensure the long-term success of the airport, continue to establish a niche in the air sector across Ontario, and further enhance the value of the airport to the economic development of business in Niagara. “The operation of a healthy, growing and fully-supported airport is a crucial aspect of a transportation and development plan for any city or region,” Garrett added. “We are thankful that Niagara boasts an airport that has been supported for 92 years; however, for it to fully reach its potential, and for the region to leverage it, we need a partner to direct the operations and manage the investment in the facility.” All documents relating to the RFP can be found on MERX and Bonfire at https://procurementoffice.bonfirehub.ca/opportunities/40815. “Growing economies, growing communities, and growing businesses all rely on access,” stated Dan Pilon, CEO of the Niagara District Airport. “Airports continue to connect people, continue to move products, and continue to be a significant part of Niagara. We look forward to finding a third-party who feels as optimistic regarding the growth of our airport as we do.” Through this partnership, the NDAC seeks to improve the airport’s competitiveness and efficiency, while reducing municipal investment in airport operations and maintaining public safety and security. The partner would facilitate increased infrastructure investments, demonstrate the willingness to strategically grow targeted route development, and shape the airport’s role in connecting with community partners. For members of the public with additional questions, a list of answers to Frequently Asked Questions has been compiled and can be found at http://www.niagaradistrictairport.ca, and is linked directly off the main page of their website.

Anyone aged 12 and older will be required to show proof they are fully COVID-19 vaccinated to enter City of Niagara Falls facilities (unless an exemption applies). Requiring proof of vaccination helps to reduce risk and keep our residents and staff safe, while allowing our facilities to stay open with minimal service disruptions. This approach focuses on higher-risk indoor public settings where face coverings cannot always be worn, meeting and event spaces and facilities used for sports and fitness, and sporting events. The effective date for each City facility is as follows: Gale Centre (September 22) Coronation Centre (September 22) Niagara Falls History Museum (September 22) City Hall (September 27) Chippawa Arena (September 29) MacBain Customer Service Centre (October 4) At the Gale Centre, those required to provide proof of vaccination include: Any adult (18+) accessing the facility for any purpose, including parents or guardians of youth participating in an organized sport, walkers and the general public. Youth (12+) that are spectating and not actively participating. Youth under 18 years of age actively participating in an organized sport, including training, practices, games and competitions, patrons with a medical exemption, and workers or volunteers (including coaches and officials) are not required to provide proof of vaccination at the Gale Centre. Individuals can provide proof of immunization by downloading or printing their vaccine receipt from the provincial booking portal https://covid19.ontariohealth.ca/ , or by calling the Provincial Vaccine Booking Line at 1-833-943-3900. Those with medical exemptions must provide proof as identified by the Province in order to access facilities. The province is developing an enhanced vaccine certificate with a unique QR code and accompanying verification app to allow users to securely and safely verify their vaccination status when scanned. The enhanced vaccine certificate and a verification app to enable businesses to read the QR code will be available beginning October 22. City staff will adopt this method when available. Persons without proof of vaccination, who wish to access regular services at City Hall or the MacBain Customer Service Centre, will be required to book an appointment where alternative service delivery options may be accommodated.

Anyone aged 12 and older will be required to show proof they are fully COVID-19 vaccinated to enter City of Niagara Falls facilities (unless an exemption applies). Requiring proof of vaccination helps to reduce risk and keep our residents and staff safe, while allowing our facilities to stay open with minimal service disruptions. This approach focuses on higher-risk indoor public settings where face coverings cannot always be worn, meeting and event spaces and facilities used for sports and fitness, and sporting events. The effective date for each City facility is as follows: Gale Centre (September 22) Coronation Centre (September 22) Niagara Falls History Museum (September 22) City Hall (September 27) Chippawa Arena (September 29) MacBain Customer Service Centre (October 4) At the Gale Centre, those required to provide proof of vaccination include: Any adult (18+) accessing the facility for any purpose, including parents or guardians of youth participating in an organized sport, walkers and the general public. Youth (12+) that are spectating and not actively participating. Youth under 18 years of age actively participating in an organized sport, including training, practices, games and competitions, patrons with a medical exemption, and workers or volunteers (including coaches and officials) are not required to provide proof of vaccination at the Gale Centre. Individuals can provide proof of immunization by downloading or printing their vaccine receipt from the provincial booking portal https://covid19.ontariohealth.ca/ , or by calling the Provincial Vaccine Booking Line at 1-833-943-3900. Those with medical exemptions must provide proof as identified by the Province in order to access facilities. The province is developing an enhanced vaccine certificate with a unique QR code and accompanying verification app to allow users to securely and safely verify their vaccination status when scanned. The enhanced vaccine certificate and a verification app to enable businesses to read the QR code will be available beginning October 22. City staff will adopt this method when available. Persons without proof of vaccination, who wish to access regular services at City Hall or the MacBain Customer Service Centre, will be required to book an appointment where alternative service delivery options may be accommodated.
