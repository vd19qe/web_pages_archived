What’s New Version History Mar 26, 2020 Version 3.0.7 We've revised and improved the experience when things go wrong, and you need to restore access to the app without losing your data. Ratings and Reviews See All 4.8 out of 5 846.9K Ratings 846.9K Ratings Editors’ Choice There’s only one thing easier than visiting the library: bringing it to you. Meet Libby, an app that lets you log in to your local library to access ebooks, audiobooks, and magazines, all for the reasonable price of free. Sign in, link your library card, and go—it’s that simple. Mmacmahon , 12/31/2018 Used for a year now—fantastic with some minor quibbles Pros: My reading has skyrocketed since using this app—Libby makes books so accessible, especially since I have a busy schedule and hard time stopping by the library. I have saved SO much money by using Libby, and have tried out more genres than I normally do, since you don’t waste a trip to the library getting a new book: simply tap to download and tap to return if you don’t like it. The waitlist system is very clear, browsing is easy, and a sizable catalog make this very much worth it. Cons: Libby loses one star for some basic syncing and history issues. If I delete Libby off my device (sometimes I get rid of it when I’m busy and I don’t want to be tempted with a quick read!), when I redownload it, I lose all history of what books I’ve previously checked out and read. When you tag books, eg “To Read”, these tags are NOT synced across devices. I now have a motley “To Read” list spread across my phone and iPad. Likewise, these lists are lost if you remove the app off your local device. I’ve emailed Libby twice to request these be synced across devices and no luck yet. Overall still a wonderful app and love how it makes reading yet more accessible. A TIP for readers—if practical, try to get multiple library cards for nearby areas. It opens up a larger catalog of books for you to read, and a waitlisted book in one library may be immediately available in another. :) CleanUI , 03/06/2020 Convert from OverDrive Finally I have switched from OverDrive to Libby. I loved the simplicity of OverDrive but eventually Libby’s overall better usability won me over. Libby is a must-have app for any avid reader/audiobook listener. I loved the recent addition of the feature of delivering later, very convenient for those of us who place holds on multiple books since it is difficult to predict when a book will indeed be available. This likely will shorten the overall wait for everyone in the waiting list. I also very much appreciate the ability to view a history of my search terms and it seems to search across all my libraries (significantly improved over OverDrive), although Libby does not clearly indicate whether it does search across libraries. This could perhaps be improved. I would have given a 4.5 rating but there is option for half points. A few improvements are desired. For one, it is never clear to me which direction my finger should slide to forward/rewind, and I often do the opposite, hence taking more time due to the confusion. It would be much better to have clearly indicated rewind/forward direction, e.g., those 15 sec rewind/forward buttons in OverDrive. Another suggestion is to make it easier to access the book details for books on my shelf. Right now ”view title details” is buried several menu clicks deep. I still use OverDrive to recommend books that my libraries don’t have — would be great to be able to do this in Libby. Information Seller OverDrive, Inc.

This has been super helpful kdrt1 , 04/10/2020 Nice app Like it due to the cross-platform trait Samuelitooooo , 04/09/2020 Duplicate functionality + sync account required It’s worth noting that you can view your passwords and logins from within the Firefox browser app itself (optionally secured with Touch ID — I have an older iPhone so I presume Face ID is available on newer ones), and you can log in to websites that way. So Lockwise’s biggest advantage today is that it allows you to log into apps, for any service that has both a website and an app. (Twitter and Facebook, for example; you can use the browser and log in via their respective websites, even on smartphones, or log in through their apps.) You canNOT generate passwords with this password manager! In fact, as far as I know, the only way to generate passwords is on desktop Firefox, and they have limited password options compared to, say, Bitwarden. Lockwise’s usefulness would multiply if I were able to generate passwords right when I’m signing up for a new account on an app right on my smartphone, or really any Sign-Up or Reset-Password process. You also cannot edit passwords on this app, but you can on the browser app (Firefox for iOS). Strange. I’d like to keep using Lockwise because it comes with Firefox’s syncing service that syncs my tabs, bookmarks, and more across all my devices, and Firefox itself is my browser of choice because of its balance of features which includes tracking protection. Otherwise I’d recommend another password manager. You may also be okay with skipping this app altogether if you don’t sign into apps often. (For example, I log into the Twitter app once and I’m set for months; in that case it won’t hurt copying my password from the Firefox browser.) And you really do need a “Firefox account” for this, so if you don’t use Firefox at all or don’t want to create an account to sync your stuff, look for another password manager. This one works best if you use Firefox and want to sync your stuff across devices. A few positives: the app is a little slow to boot up but it does generally work reliably for me personally; it doesn’t freeze on me or crash or anything. And it hides the screen when you’re multitasking and changing apps, so there’s an extra layer of person-to-person privacy for you. I like that.

I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 05/19/2019 Poor and getting worse The most recent version H (May 16,2019) changed the radar image and it now looks terrible. The background (satellite view) is too dark, and the radar image is pixelated. Also, on the iPad, the radar usually opens in the vertical or portrait mode when the iPad is positioned horizontally, as is almost always is. very annoying. 2ndfiddle2golf , 01/04/2018 Continuous obtrusive ad pop-ups Forecast & Warnings are accurate but recently the ad pop-ups are so incessant that they prevent one from reading them in full. Too annoying to keep this app so will try another local app. Also, the radar has never worked for me.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings To-Whom_It-May_Concern , 02/20/2020 New update is less than satisfactory. This new update removes a lot of features that, personally, I rather appreciated. Such as being able to tell if someone had read your message without having to open the actual conversation, holding down on emojis to make them “blow up” like a ballon, and (from reading some other people’s complaints) the games and even some stickers and the such just stop working and/or showing up. And on top of that this is an app that was originally created simply to allow people to connect by text or call without the need of a phone number, essentially making it easier for families and friends to get in touch and stay in touch for each other. This app was not meant to be, and should never mean to be as it cannot be properly supported, as a business or advertisement application. If you would like to have an app specifically for that purpose, then by all means build an app AROUND that purpose so it will work as intended without any complications or community backlash. Yes you still have the basic fundamentals, but what made people come back to using Messenger and not other messaging apps were the quirks that you have unfortunately taken out of your system. I do hope that you will take everyone’s grievances into consideration and reimplement what was taken out with this update. Thank you for your time reading this review if you ever do. Happy Mama To Be! , 02/28/2020 Used to love FB Messenger, now it’s becoming a hassle The title says it all... Messenger was a great way for me to communicate for both personal and business oriented things but these last couple of updates have drastically changed the effectiveness of the app. I am not sure if proper testing is being done before updates launch but I have never had so many problems as I have had the last two months. App randomly crashes or freezes up. Whole conversations are lost. Now the audio messaging feature is not functioning properly. I was really excited about the new look for the feature and the fact that you didn’t have to hold down the microphone button to record your audio. But after only a couple of days my app now does not let me listen to audio messages I have sent nor can I listen to audio messages I have received. I have now uninstalled and reinstalled the app four times in one day. This seems to reset the audio feature back to where I have to hold down the microphone button again, but after only an hour or so I get the same error messages on audios and the function is back to the new look. This is very frustrating and I have been forced to use other avenues to communicate with friends and colleagues... Hopefully this feature is fixed sooner rather than later and maybe further testing done on app features before they launch... Nana's Girl , 04/08/2020 Please fix... Well did an update on Tuesday, & it hasn’t worked the same since, every time I want to send a picture or attachment it crashes, & closes itself out!! Can’t you peeps use things yourself, see if they work before putting the updates out there?? Whole iPhone has greatly slowed down since last update! 😳😤. Of course we all know why!!?? 😡. This update, removed the “blow up” emoticons that get bigger while holding them down, seeing wether or not others had read your post without having to actually open it. The slide to type no longer works, some of my games won’t work, can’t get to all of my stickers they just vanished, but are on my iPhone. I don’t want a business type app, this was meant originally to allow people to connect without the hassle, no ads or junk, now we have everything (all junk) Put all the extras on an app by itself, name it something different, and put this the way it was. I think you have trashed the things I liked about the app, and kept the junk. I guess I’ll find another message app. If I would have thought I should have read the reviews first this time, and just not upgraded, because it didn’t upgrade, it downgraded. I hope you read this.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Happy Mama To Be! , 02/28/2020 Used to love FB Messenger, now it’s becoming a hassle The title says it all... Messenger was a great way for me to communicate for both personal and business oriented things but these last couple of updates have drastically changed the effectiveness of the app. I am not sure if proper testing is being done before updates launch but I have never had so many problems as I have had the last two months. App randomly crashes or freezes up. Whole conversations are lost. Now the audio messaging feature is not functioning properly. I was really excited about the new look for the feature and the fact that you didn’t have to hold down the microphone button to record your audio. But after only a couple of days my app now does not let me listen to audio messages I have sent nor can I listen to audio messages I have received. I have now uninstalled and reinstalled the app four times in one day. This seems to reset the audio feature back to where I have to hold down the microphone button again, but after only an hour or so I get the same error messages on audios and the function is back to the new look. This is very frustrating and I have been forced to use other avenues to communicate with friends and colleagues... Hopefully this feature is fixed sooner rather than later and maybe further testing done on app features before they launch... Aye K , 04/22/2020 Give the people what they want Soooo, no matter what, this app can’t be bypassed in order to communicate with others on FB. A change i personally was not pleased about but whatever. Then as it progressed it elevated to be more appeasing by incorporating fun and entertaining elements such as color and name change, pushing the send till it blew up larger, having games that can be played with others, etc.... it’s confusing why such things that made it stand apart from other apps would be taken away. Was the plan to make messenger extremely basic to allow for other apps to have a chance?! See... not everyone has an IPhone where you can play games through text messaging and not everyone wants to have a million games downloaded on their phone taking up space. Therefore, speaking for this specifically allowed for anyone with messenger to not only message but engage in other ways also with no cellphone type barrier. If nothing else... games and other things that enhance communication and engagement is what i personally would enjoy incorporated and/or being brought back. Having different options to explore regardless of the type of phone you have bridges that gap and can help bring people together in more ways other than just dialogue. Just saying Nana's Girl , 04/08/2020 Please fix... Well did an update on Tuesday, & it hasn’t worked the same since, every time I want to send a picture or attachment it crashes, & closes itself out!! Can’t you peeps use things yourself, see if they work before putting the updates out there?? Whole iPhone has greatly slowed down since last update! 😳😤. Of course we all know why!!?? 😡. This update, removed the “blow up” emoticons that get bigger while holding them down, seeing wether or not others had read your post without having to actually open it. The slide to type no longer works, some of my games won’t work, can’t get to all of my stickers they just vanished, but are on my iPhone. I don’t want a business type app, this was meant originally to allow people to connect without the hassle, no ads or junk, now we have everything (all junk) Put all the extras on an app by itself, name it something different, and put this the way it was. I think you have trashed the things I liked about the app, and kept the junk. I guess I’ll find another message app. If I would have thought I should have read the reviews first this time, and just not upgraded, because it didn’t upgrade, it downgraded. I hope you read this.

On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout.

My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Nana's Girl , 04/08/2020 Please fix... Well did an update on Tuesday, & it hasn’t worked the same since, every time I want to send a picture or attachment it crashes, & closes itself out!! Can’t you peeps use things yourself, see if they work before putting the updates out there?? Whole iPhone has greatly slowed down since last update! 😳😤. Of course we all know why!!?? 😡. This update, removed the “blow up” emoticons that get bigger while holding them down, seeing wether or not others had read your post without having to actually open it. The slide to type no longer works, some of my games won’t work, can’t get to all of my stickers they just vanished, but are on my iPhone. I don’t want a business type app, this was meant originally to allow people to connect without the hassle, no ads or junk, now we have everything (all junk) Put all the extras on an app by itself, name it something different, and put this the way it was. I think you have trashed the things I liked about the app, and kept the junk. I guess I’ll find another message app. If I would have thought I should have read the reviews first this time, and just not upgraded, because it didn’t upgrade, it downgraded. I hope you read this. As I’m gonna see how right my review is, by reading everyone else’s! Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app?

For the small business owner a.k.a. someone with a limited promotional budget, this site is terrific and offers a lot more free features than GoogleMyBusiness does for [free] website creation. Plus Strikingly will even host your website for free (provided you’re not trying have a ton of folks hit your site all at once). I’ve been using it since August 2018 and overall I am quite pleased. If you want more than the “free stuff” like e-commerce then yes you’ll have to pay but it’s not like you have to look elsewhere- they offer it at a reasonable price. Try it out. I know the free stuff is all I need (for now) and the speed it serves up the page across multiple platforms is excellent. My testmysite (part of Google Business) scores mine at 3s which is Excellent. Thank you Team Strikingly! aam daha bu g , 09/05/2019 LOVE This app ❤️❤️❤️ I have been wanting a full scale Strikingly app for years and with this we finally we got it . I have been using Strikingly “blog” app for years and it’s been okay (sometimes good and sometimes bad) but this is like the full desktop experience but on my app. I am on app 8+ and it runs so smooth and fast and I can do essentially anything that I can do on desktop. It’s interface is simple and does everything that I want it to do . Awesome!!! Hell my 2017 iMac sometimes struggles with Strikingly (says it’s eating lots of memory on safari ) and so far no problems from this app . Wow 😮 zaaBend T , 09/05/2019 Quite useful! This app is super useful for running my blog - I often find myself opening my laptop to make small scheduling changes for posts, and edit typos out. This makes it easier to do small things like that on the go. However, it does take quite a few clicks to get to scheduling posts and stuff like that - if there was a way to make that process a little easier, and maybe customize what appears on the homepage (shortcuts for frequently accessed features?) that would be extremely helpful. Overall, really awesome app though! Information Seller Striking.ly, Inc. Size 25.9 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 9.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.8 out of 5 919.7K Ratings 919.7K Ratings Editors’ Choice There’s only one thing easier than visiting the library: bringing it to you. Meet Libby, an app that lets you log in to your local library to access ebooks, audiobooks, and magazines, all for the reasonable price of free. Sign in, link your library card, and go—it’s that simple. Mmacmahon , 12/31/2018 Used for a year now—fantastic with some minor quibbles Pros: My reading has skyrocketed since using this app—Libby makes books so accessible, especially since I have a busy schedule and hard time stopping by the library. I have saved SO much money by using Libby, and have tried out more genres than I normally do, since you don’t waste a trip to the library getting a new book: simply tap to download and tap to return if you don’t like it. The waitlist system is very clear, browsing is easy, and a sizable catalog make this very much worth it. Cons: Libby loses one star for some basic syncing and history issues. If I delete Libby off my device (sometimes I get rid of it when I’m busy and I don’t want to be tempted with a quick read!), when I redownload it, I lose all history of what books I’ve previously checked out and read. When you tag books, eg “To Read”, these tags are NOT synced across devices. I now have a motley “To Read” list spread across my phone and iPad. Likewise, these lists are lost if you remove the app off your local device. I’ve emailed Libby twice to request these be synced across devices and no luck yet. Overall still a wonderful app and love how it makes reading yet more accessible. A TIP for readers—if practical, try to get multiple library cards for nearby areas. It opens up a larger catalog of books for you to read, and a waitlisted book in one library may be immediately available in another. :) CleanUI , 03/06/2020 Convert from OverDrive Finally I have switched from OverDrive to Libby. I loved the simplicity of OverDrive but eventually Libby’s overall better usability won me over. Libby is a must-have app for any avid reader/audiobook listener. I loved the recent addition of the feature of delivering later, very convenient for those of us who place holds on multiple books since it is difficult to predict when a book will indeed be available. This likely will shorten the overall wait for everyone in the waiting list. I also very much appreciate the ability to view a history of my search terms and it seems to search across all my libraries (significantly improved over OverDrive), although Libby does not clearly indicate whether it does search across libraries. This could perhaps be improved. I would have given a 4.5 rating but there is option for half points. A few improvements are desired. For one, it is never clear to me which direction my finger should slide to forward/rewind, and I often do the opposite, hence taking more time due to the confusion. It would be much better to have clearly indicated rewind/forward direction, e.g., those 15 sec rewind/forward buttons in OverDrive. Another suggestion is to make it easier to access the book details for books on my shelf. Right now ”view title details” is buried several menu clicks deep. I still use OverDrive to recommend books that my libraries don’t have — would be great to be able to do this in Libby. Information Seller OverDrive, Inc.

On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. Logan45919 , 05/04/2020 Love it!

I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm. She gives no direction or amplitude of the wind with no clouds that she says is going to bring cooling to Western NewYork. Todd always gives a complete and through report.

I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm. She gives no direction or amplitude of the wind with no clouds that she says is going to bring cooling to Western NewYork. Todd always gives a complete and through report.

There is no support for facebook as ive reached out plenty of times and if they cant fix the issue you will just get ignored because theyd rather take money than fix anything and somehow they stay at the top of the social app list simply because they make everyone update it every couple days, facebook is a sham now, i have to keep coming back to update my reviews literally after every update which has been every other day, and yet still no word from facebook or apple as to why i cant send important voicememos MihaiLH , 05/07/2020 Voice recording Regarding the voice recording option...I have noticed for a while, specifically after an update I was forced to make, that I cannot scroll the window while recording, otherwise all that I've recorded dissapears, and I have to start over again. My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Nana's Girl , 04/08/2020 Please fix...

I have saved SO much money by using Libby, and have tried out more genres than I normally do, since you don’t waste a trip to the library getting a new book: simply tap to download and tap to return if you don’t like it. The waitlist system is very clear, browsing is easy, and a sizable catalog make this very much worth it. Cons: Libby loses one star for some basic syncing and history issues. If I delete Libby off my device (sometimes I get rid of it when I’m busy and I don’t want to be tempted with a quick read!), when I redownload it, I lose all history of what books I’ve previously checked out and read. When you tag books, eg “To Read”, these tags are NOT synced across devices. I now have a motley “To Read” list spread across my phone and iPad. Likewise, these lists are lost if you remove the app off your local device. I’ve emailed Libby twice to request these be synced across devices and no luck yet. Overall still a wonderful app and love how it makes reading yet more accessible. A TIP for readers—if practical, try to get multiple library cards for nearby areas. It opens up a larger catalog of books for you to read, and a waitlisted book in one library may be immediately available in another. :) CleanUI , 03/06/2020 Convert from OverDrive Finally I have switched from OverDrive to Libby. I loved the simplicity of OverDrive but eventually Libby’s overall better usability won me over. Libby is a must-have app for any avid reader/audiobook listener. I loved the recent addition of the feature of delivering later, very convenient for those of us who place holds on multiple books since it is difficult to predict when a book will indeed be available. This likely will shorten the overall wait for everyone in the waiting list. I also very much appreciate the ability to view a history of my search terms and it seems to search across all my libraries (significantly improved over OverDrive), although Libby does not clearly indicate whether it does search across libraries. This could perhaps be improved. I would have given a 4.5 rating but there is option for half points. A few improvements are desired. For one, it is never clear to me which direction my finger should slide to forward/rewind, and I often do the opposite, hence taking more time due to the confusion. It would be much better to have clearly indicated rewind/forward direction, e.g., those 15 sec rewind/forward buttons in OverDrive. Another suggestion is to make it easier to access the book details for books on my shelf. Right now ”view title details” is buried several menu clicks deep. I still use OverDrive to recommend books that my libraries don’t have — would be great to be able to do this in Libby. Information Seller OverDrive, Inc.

It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 05/19/2019 Poor and getting worse The most recent version H (May 16,2019) changed the radar image and it now looks terrible. The background (satellite view) is too dark, and the radar image is pixelated. Also, on the iPad, the radar usually opens in the vertical or portrait mode when the iPad is positioned horizontally, as is almost always is. very annoying. 2ndfiddle2golf , 01/04/2018 Continuous obtrusive ad pop-ups Forecast & Warnings are accurate but recently the ad pop-ups are so incessant that they prevent one from reading them in full. Too annoying to keep this app so will try another local app. Also, the radar has never worked for me.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings angry customer paid , 05/18/2020 What a bunch of scammers Lol i have to keep writing honest bad reviews for this god awful of an app because the developers think its smart to release an update every three days that doesnt fix any of the actual problems within the app, like not being able to send voice memos ow because facebook messenger glitched out that option, and the really annoying notification in my facebook app which is completley seperate yet when i click the notification in the real facebook app it takes me to messenger to check the notifications, and yet there is no real notifications, its just a constant notification , ive deleted and reinstalled the app plenty of times, im done with facebook for now, they have literally released an update for this piece of garabage every couple days and dont fix any of the actual problems, yet somehow theres always more data to install? There is no support for facebook as ive reached out plenty of times and if they cant fix the issue you will just get ignored because theyd rather take money than fix anything and somehow they stay at the top of the social app list simply because they make everyone update it every couple days, facebook is a sham now, i have to keep coming back to update my reviews literally after every update which has been every other day, and yet still no word from facebook or apple as to why i cant send important voicememos MihaiLH , 05/07/2020 Voice recording Regarding the voice recording option...I have noticed for a while, specifically after an update I was forced to make, that I cannot scroll the window while recording, otherwise all that I've recorded dissapears, and I have to start over again. My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Nana's Girl , 04/08/2020 Please fix... Well did an update on Tuesday, & it hasn’t worked the same since, every time I want to send a picture or attachment it crashes, & closes itself out!! Can’t you peeps use things yourself, see if they work before putting the updates out there?? Whole iPhone has greatly slowed down since last update! 😳😤. Of course we all know why!!?? 😡. This update, removed the “blow up” emoticons that get bigger while holding them down, seeing wether or not others had read your post without having to actually open it. The slide to type no longer works, some of my games won’t work, can’t get to all of my stickers they just vanished, but are on my iPhone. I don’t want a business type app, this was meant originally to allow people to connect without the hassle, no ads or junk, now we have everything (all junk) Put all the extras on an app by itself, name it something different, and put this the way it was. I think you have trashed the things I liked about the app, and kept the junk. I guess I’ll find another message app. If I would have thought I should have read the reviews first this time, and just not upgraded, because it didn’t upgrade, it downgraded. I hope you read this.

They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 05/19/2019 Poor and getting worse The most recent version H (May 16,2019) changed the radar image and it now looks terrible. The background (satellite view) is too dark, and the radar image is pixelated. Also, on the iPad, the radar usually opens in the vertical or portrait mode when the iPad is positioned horizontally, as is almost always is. very annoying.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! MihaiLH , 05/07/2020 Voice recording Regarding the voice recording option...I have noticed for a while, specifically after an update I was forced to make, that I cannot scroll the window while recording, otherwise all that I've recorded dissapears, and I have to start over again. My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.9 out of 5 27 Ratings 27 Ratings gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. cmfrtblynmb0202 , 06/08/2020 Needs more development but it is promising. And free Mozilla is a treasure. Every single password management service became money grabbing scheme. All became subscription based. Having said that, this needs development. For starters I cant find a way to handle multi log in situations for the same website. It needs attention. Still i give it a five star, not because it is perfect, but it is a good first step. Logan45919 , 05/04/2020 Love it! I only recently discovered Lockwise was available on my mobile devices as well. This is fantastic! I can now carry all of my saved passwords from my computer and they are always synced on all of my devices. Mozilla, you gotta market this a little more!

The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm.

On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. cmfrtblynmb0202 , 06/08/2020 Needs more development but it is promising. And free Mozilla is a treasure. Every single password management service became money grabbing scheme. All became subscription based. Having said that, this needs development. For starters I cant find a way to handle multi log in situations for the same website. It needs attention. Still i give it a five star, not because it is perfect, but it is a good first step.

I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4.

I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! MihaiLH , 05/07/2020 Voice recording Regarding the voice recording option...I have noticed for a while, specifically after an update I was forced to make, that I cannot scroll the window while recording, otherwise all that I've recorded dissapears, and I have to start over again. My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not. I hope you read this and can do something about it, please and thank you. Information Seller Facebook, Inc.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! MihaiLH , 05/07/2020 Voice recording Regarding the voice recording option...I have noticed for a while, specifically after an update I was forced to make, that I cannot scroll the window while recording, otherwise all that I've recorded dissapears, and I have to start over again. My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.9 out of 5 33 Ratings 33 Ratings gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. cmfrtblynmb0202 , 06/08/2020 Needs more development but it is promising. And free Mozilla is a treasure. Every single password management service became money grabbing scheme. All became subscription based. Having said that, this needs development. For starters I cant find a way to handle multi log in situations for the same website. It needs attention. Still i give it a five star, not because it is perfect, but it is a good first step. Logan45919 , 05/04/2020 Love it! I only recently discovered Lockwise was available on my mobile devices as well. This is fantastic! I can now carry all of my saved passwords from my computer and they are always synced on all of my devices. Mozilla, you gotta market this a little more!

The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm. She gives no direction or amplitude of the wind with no clouds that she says is going to bring cooling to Western NewYork. Todd always gives a complete and through report. He show what to expect in every portion of every county of western NewYork, through with how much snow and how it will affect roads for travel, melt for flooding, type and amount of precipitation, a clear and complete report!!!!!!

On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. cmfrtblynmb0202 , 06/08/2020 Needs more development but it is promising. And free Mozilla is a treasure. Every single password management service became money grabbing scheme. All became subscription based. Having said that, this needs development. For starters I cant find a way to handle multi log in situations for the same website. It needs attention. Still i give it a five star, not because it is perfect, but it is a good first step.

I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4.

I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! MihaiLH , 05/07/2020 Voice recording Regarding the voice recording option...I have noticed for a while, specifically after an update I was forced to make, that I cannot scroll the window while recording, otherwise all that I've recorded dissapears, and I have to start over again. My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not. I hope you read this and can do something about it, please and thank you. Information Seller Facebook, Inc.

I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I love this thing! Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! MihaiLH , 05/07/2020 Voice recording Regarding the voice recording option...I have noticed for a while, specifically after an update I was forced to make, that I cannot scroll the window while recording, otherwise all that I've recorded dissapears, and I have to start over again. My question is...why can't you follow the same pattern whatsApp has and actually keep the recording option visible and available while scrolling up and down, without any issues? And also, when and if I lock the screen, the recording should be paused and not lost, again, something that on whatsApp you've managed to make it work, but not for Facebook Messenger. It's very frustrating and primitive, as I'm wasting a lot of time trying to deliver a vocal message. Another important lack of utility is the absence of a cursor while listening to a voice recording, as I'm not able to move back or forward the message, so If I need to listen again a certain part of it, I can't, but instead I have to start from the beginning and wait until I get to that part again. And why am I not notified when the recording is over? I could keep talking and have no ideea it's not recording anymore. So, my review for your latest updates would be ZERO, if I could select this kind of rate. You are not improving the application, you are making it worse! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not. I hope you read this and can do something about it, please and thank you. Information Seller Facebook, Inc.

Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I love this thing!

The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm. She gives no direction or amplitude of the wind with no clouds that she says is going to bring cooling to Western NewYork. Todd always gives a complete and through report. He show what to expect in every portion of every county of western NewYork, through with how much snow and how it will affect roads for travel, melt for flooding, type and amount of precipitation, a clear and complete report!!!!!!

They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I love this thing! Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! Ms Emll , 07/17/2020 Rather old Facebook message I deleted the Facebook messenger app because I was unable to delete things that were sent to me that I did not want. I was getting all kinds of scams asking me to take something I didn’t want and saying I won things I never won. I was using it on another device and I had a problem with my device after that and it was not working anymore. I have a new device that is very expensive and I do not want a virus attack because of a link in this messenger app. The main thing I deleted the app for was because I could not delete things that I did not want. I could not keep people from sending me things there was no way to block that person from contacting me with these things that I know are scams and possibly someone was hacked on the app I don’t know. I just did not feel safe using that app anymore. I have people that can’t contact me now from Facebook because they have no other way to contact me. And I cannot message them unless I use the FacebookMessenger app! If you could correct these things I’d feel safe about using it again. I don’t think we need video chat or whatever you have now! Just get back to the regular Facebook messaging please!I only want messaging my family and friends that I cannot contact otherwise! If this app is not changed I will have to take it off again and keep it off! Then my family and friends will no longer be able to contact me since they have no other way to do so other than Facebook! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not. I hope you read this and can do something about it, please and thank you. Information Seller Facebook, Inc.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not. I hope you read this and can do something about it, please and thank you. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app?

It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.1M Ratings 1.1M Ratings Gshot2002 , 05/07/2020 I have a suggestion This is a pretty good app in my opinion! I use it 24/7 to talk to my friends. I use it more than my phone’s built in texting app. I love that you’re able to video chat with people, see if they’re active, and you can personalize the chat a little bit. The biggest complaint I have though is that you can’t delete images from the photos and videos section of the chat’s settings. You can only delete those things from the actual conversation. This is bothersome to me because I talk a lot to my friends and if I want to go back and delete some old images, I’m unable to because they’re too far up in older conversations. I also can’t search my conversations anymore because it always bugs out. It won’t load the conversations and then after that, the app won’t work at all. If you could take these things into consideration, especially the deleting suggestion, then I would very much appreciate it! Otherwise though, this is my #1 messaging app! Hg52 , 06/02/2020 Glitches #1: when I’m typing a reply to one of my friends and someone messages me simultaneously, it closes me out of the conversation and erases all of what I had written and just brings me back to my inbox and it’s really frustrating because it happens every single time and always seems to happen when I’m typing long messages and then I have to start all over. PLEASE FIX ASAP!! Cause I just wanna use a different app to talk to my friends now but would prefer not to! This has been a thing for 2-3 weeks now and hasn’t changed even though I update it every time I get the chance to. Just downloaded the update for today so I’ll see if that makes any difference, but I highly doubt it because the update didn’t list anything about bug fixes. #2: this glitch just stared happening yesterday (June 1st, 2020) where I haven’t been getting notifications for new messages. I made sure to check my notifications were on in my settings, which they were, but my friend sent me a message at 9am and didn’t get it until 2:50pm. So please fix, again, this is very frustrating and I don’t want people to get mad at me and think that I’m ignoring them when I’m not. I hope you read this and can do something about it, please and thank you. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app?

On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. das rhetorician , 07/14/2020 Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I love this thing! Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station. badger1949 , 03/11/2018 News 4 Weather Todd Santos gives an outstanding report West but Kaylie Went’s report is useless March 11 at 11:00 pm. She gives no direction or amplitude of the wind with no clouds that she says is going to bring cooling to Western NewYork. Todd always gives a complete and through report. He show what to expect in every portion of every county of western NewYork, through with how much snow and how it will affect roads for travel, melt for flooding, type and amount of precipitation, a clear and complete report!!!!!!

I’d also like to say that I love using this app and that it’s one of my favorite messaging apps despite what many people think. It’s got many features and special effects and I like it. I do have a problem that I’d like to address, so I hope you read this review. Ever since some of the recent updates, I haven’t been able to add my new phone number to my account (since I recently changed my old one) nor have I been able to change my profile picture. The reason? Well, that’s because I don’t have a Facebook account since I made my account on my old phone number. It would be cool if I could make a Facebook account for my messenger account since I don’t want to make a new one and lose all my contacts, but that isn’t a feature, at least not yet. Other than that, the app is great, I just hope you get this fixed soon and I hope this review finds you well.

Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

I’d also like to say that I love using this app and that it’s one of my favorite messaging apps despite what many people think. It’s got many features and special effects and I like it. I do have a problem that I’d like to address, so I hope you read this review. Ever since some of the recent updates, I haven’t been able to add my new phone number to my account (since I recently changed my old one) nor have I been able to change my profile picture. The reason? Well, that’s because I don’t have a Facebook account since I made my account on my old phone number. It would be cool if I could make a Facebook account for my messenger account since I don’t want to make a new one and lose all my contacts, but that isn’t a feature, at least not yet. Other than that, the app is great, I just hope you get this fixed soon and I hope this review finds you well. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

Abused Elder , 09/09/2020 Negligence I recently had a new breaker box installed at my home and when the workers were done we called to have the power turned back on. When the man arrived he told my workers that they needed to switch out a box cover. That only took a half an hour at which point it was 6 o’clock. So I called them again to have them turn the power back on and the man on the phone told me we cannot guarantee they will be there anymore today it will have to be tomorrow. I explained that I am an elderly woman and I really needed to have air-conditioning in this kind of weather. So he said well that’s just the way it is. I can guarantee that they’ll be there tomorrow. What kind of company does this? You need to get a new policy because leaving an elderly woman in 90° weather with no electricity is unconscionable!!! I even offered to pay an extra $50 if they would come and turn the power back on. So he told me OK they’ll be there by 11:30 tonight. So I stayed up and guess what; nobody came. I feel as though I should report this to the Better Business Bureau . And I will unless someone offers me an apology. I was going to try to rise above it but it is just eating away at me, the careless, negligent way in which I was treated. And I hope to God that it was not because my electrician and his helper were black.

Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 53 Ratings 53 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes.

Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. das rhetorician , 07/14/2020 Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I love this thing! Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Information Seller Mozilla Corporation Size 58.7 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement. Information Seller LIN Television Corporation Size 132.2 MB Category Weather Compatibility Requires iOS 12.0 or later.

Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Information Seller Mozilla Corporation Size 58.7 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 61 Ratings 61 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Information Seller Mozilla Corporation Size 58.7 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Jade Hicks , 11/11/2020 Disgusted! Honestly I enjoy messenger and use it frequently to keep in touch... UNTIL JUST NOW. VANISH MODE?! Messenger now has a feature where you can slide up when on a chat with someone and change the chat to “vanish mode” where you can discreetly talk to people and the messages will be erased after they are seen and you log out of the chat. It reports when screenshots or screen recordings are taken. DO YOU NOT REALIZE THE DOORS YOU JUST OPENED UP FOR PEDOPHILES, CHEATERS, MINORS ETC.?! If you truly want that to be a feature perhaps you should secretly store the messages (as I’m sure you actually do anyway) and if the messages seem to be suspect of cheating, send them to the person that is “in a relationship” with the account holder on Facebook. That’d be a true hit for this feature that many people would be more thankful for. But if you don’t do something like that (which I’m sure you wouldn’t) this feature is purely disgusting and distasteful! Facebook is worried about the spread of fake news but encourages cheaters? That’s fake news for them to tell someone else they love them and go behind them to use your app’s vanish feature to “love” or “lust” on someone else. Disgusting. Take it away, or use it as I mentioned. Many others have said they were disgusted as well. It’s a bad look for what was a great app to use. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app?

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 63 Ratings 63 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Information Seller Mozilla Corporation Size 58.7 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

I’m wondering why messenger isn’t up to date with everyone else. I’m sure others have the same thoughts, A lot of individuals use this service to call and message others along with maps people send others when they are trying to meet and for products and merchandise just for an example. Why can we not have this app sync with our vehicles like the phone and messages app that Apple have in place. This would be a very nice update to an increasingly popular app. Not only that, but it would make us, yes even yourselves safer on the road. After all isn’t that what we all strive for, I know your users strive for this on a daily basis. Please if you would, look into this. I for one drive a very huge truck 2016 F350 dually FX 4 lifted & oversized tires for work purposes. I am a safety officer so I especially know safety is of the utmost concern no matter what we do as a society. I for one love my Sync3 system and would love to be able to use it to keep us all a little safer. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 65 Ratings 65 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Information Seller Mozilla Corporation Size 58.7 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

I’m wondering why messenger isn’t up to date with everyone else. I’m sure others have the same thoughts, A lot of individuals use this service to call and message others along with maps people send others when they are trying to meet and for products and merchandise just for an example. Why can we not have this app sync with our vehicles like the phone and messages app that Apple have in place. This would be a very nice update to an increasingly popular app. Not only that, but it would make us, yes even yourselves safer on the road. After all isn’t that what we all strive for, I know your users strive for this on a daily basis. Please if you would, look into this. I for one drive a very huge truck 2016 F350 dually FX 4 lifted & oversized tires for work purposes. I am a safety officer so I especially know safety is of the utmost concern no matter what we do as a society. I for one love my Sync3 system and would love to be able to use it to keep us all a little safer. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 66 Ratings 66 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Information Seller Mozilla Corporation Size 58.7 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

I’m wondering why messenger isn’t up to date with everyone else. I’m sure others have the same thoughts, A lot of individuals use this service to call and message others along with maps people send others when they are trying to meet and for products and merchandise just for an example. Why can we not have this app sync with our vehicles like the phone and messages app that Apple have in place. This would be a very nice update to an increasingly popular app. Not only that, but it would make us, yes even yourselves safer on the road. After all isn’t that what we all strive for, I know your users strive for this on a daily basis. Please if you would, look into this. I for one drive a very huge truck 2016 F350 dually FX 4 lifted & oversized tires for work purposes. I am a safety officer so I especially know safety is of the utmost concern no matter what we do as a society. I for one love my Sync3 system and would love to be able to use it to keep us all a little safer. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.6 out of 5 66 Ratings 66 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Information Seller Mozilla Corporation Size 58.7 MB Category Productivity Compatibility Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

I’m wondering why messenger isn’t up to date with everyone else. I’m sure others have the same thoughts, A lot of individuals use this service to call and message others along with maps people send others when they are trying to meet and for products and merchandise just for an example. Why can we not have this app sync with our vehicles like the phone and messages app that Apple have in place. This would be a very nice update to an increasingly popular app. Not only that, but it would make us, yes even yourselves safer on the road. After all isn’t that what we all strive for, I know your users strive for this on a daily basis. Please if you would, look into this. I for one drive a very huge truck 2016 F350 dually FX 4 lifted & oversized tires for work purposes. I am a safety officer so I especially know safety is of the utmost concern no matter what we do as a society. I for one love my Sync3 system and would love to be able to use it to keep us all a little safer. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.6 out of 5 68 Ratings 68 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! App Privacy See Details The developer, Mozilla, has not provided details about its privacy practices and handling of data to Apple.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do . what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done.

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.6 out of 5 70 Ratings 70 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! App Privacy See Details The developer, Mozilla, has not provided details about its privacy practices and handling of data to Apple.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do . what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done.

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 73 Ratings 73 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! App Privacy See Details The developer, Mozilla, has not provided details about its privacy practices and handling of data to Apple.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? trixiecheer , 08/23/2020 Messenger disappears My messenger icon disappeared a while ago and I wasn’t able to access it. I was able to do it through Facebook though. Then I found the icon on my iPhone through Siri app suggestions. Well now I can’t access it at all. Not through Facebook and not through Siri app suggestions, which is the only place that had the icon I could access. When I do click on it it shows for less than a second and disappears. It does it through Facebook, when I click on that messenger icon, and even when I try to get Siri to access it. When I go onto the App Store, it does the same thing. I want to uninstall it to hopefully restart it. I have rebooted my phone and left it off all night hoping that would help, but it didn’t. The icon that shows in Siri app suggestions will not allow me to hold it down so I can delete it like any other app. I think it’s because it’s not the app itself, just showing the icon that allowed me to access thru it, but that was it.I don’t know if this is making any sense or if I’m even explaining it correctly. I would literally have to show somebody what’s going on. All I could say is I cannot access messenger in any way shape or form not even to delete it or anything and I don’t know what to do .

I feel the opportunity for your app to shine would be to add the ability to promote the event by adding the option of email and social media invites. It’s very difficult to use Eventbrite website on a cell phone or tablet. goyalnilay , 2020-08-03 Keeps asking me to log in again and again Terrible unusable app. Just keeps showing me the login screen.

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 73 Ratings 73 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features. tr0mbonedude , 10/10/2020 Needs a few more features to be This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! App Privacy See Details The developer, Mozilla, has not provided details about its privacy practices and handling of data to Apple.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done.

I feel the opportunity for your app to shine would be to add the ability to promote the event by adding the option of email and social media invites. It’s very difficult to use Eventbrite website on a cell phone or tablet. goyalnilay , 2020-08-03 Keeps asking me to log in again and again Terrible unusable app. Just keeps showing me the login screen. After I enter the username and password, it takes me back to the login screen. I expect better from an otherwise good event management platform. Katie S.

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.6 out of 5 74 Ratings 74 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! das rhetorician , 12/24/2020 NEW EDIT! Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I would love to be able to 2FA protect it like 1Password Byron LastPass owners can. Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... Also, the ability to EDIT password entries and to manually enter password credentials is essential and important to me and many other users! Please update this soon Mozilla! thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings KnD33 , 12/22/2020 Annoying ghost notification, have to delete/reinstall repeatedly I miss the old menu, the new one makes getting to things much more difficult. I have a hard enough time explaining where features are to my grandmother, and this didn’t help at all. But my biggest complaint is that for the past month or two, I’ve had an “extra” notification appear on the app icon. Like I have a message, except I do not. l check my “spam” folder, message requests, even scroll through all my messages, and nothing. But it will still show “1” on the icon. I deleted it and downloaded it again and that helped, for a short amount of time before it happened again. This is my 3rd time deleting and reinstalling. It’s not just annoying. I have a small business and lots of projects with various clients and I use this to communicate with them 9 times out of 10 as they found me on Facebook, so I can’t avoid using it. And I use it to communicate with some family, so it’s nerve wracking thinking I’m either somehow “missing” (it’s not there) a message that could be important. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform.

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 75 Ratings 75 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! das rhetorician , 12/24/2020 NEW EDIT! Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I would love to be able to 2FA protect it like 1Password Byron LastPass owners can. Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... Also, the ability to EDIT password entries and to manually enter password credentials is essential and important to me and many other users! Please update this soon Mozilla! thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done.

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.6 out of 5 77 Ratings 77 Ratings Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! das rhetorician , 12/24/2020 NEW EDIT! Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I would love to be able to 2FA protect it like 1Password Byron LastPass owners can. Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... Also, the ability to EDIT password entries and to manually enter password credentials is essential and important to me and many other users! Please update this soon Mozilla! thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan! gdsouza Gustavo , 05/02/2020 Not bad, but needs a lot more features The app is pretty nice, especially on the desktop, but the mobile app, is very very simple and lacks a lot of things, especially the ability to add new entries, and to set a ""name"" or ""tag"" to each entry, this would make it easier to find things, and make everything more organized. On the same organization subject, there could be a folder system, to group related passwords and logins, another one is, a custom/more complex entry, e.g with notes. From mozilla I really expected a bit more, every other service from mozilla is amazingly well done, aesthetically pleasing and very complete, this one was really a disappointment though, but it has a lot of room and a great platform already built for lots of improvement. Even if it had a subscription/paid service, it would be great to have all those features.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

I see that the latest update was two weeks ago, and usually Facebook likes to update all of their apps every two days 🤨 While the app *is* functional, it lacks some of the updated features that are all available on the iPhone app and mostly available via the direct website — such as FB avatars stickers and the like (i do appreciate the extra choices for emoji reacts, tho’; i just wish there were more heart options with that). My iPad is on the latest OS (iPadOS 14) and is an iPad Air 2...this latest update of Facebook Messenger is an incomplete version of the latest update for its version on iPhone 😐 would be nice to access ALL of the latest features on this app for iPad, since there’s more space on my iPad than on on my iPhone to support it. Hopefully, y’all will come back with a new update of ALL the latest features soon... Lady Ash A. , 04/04/2020 New Update is Trash, Useless (iOS) The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send. I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app? what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done.

This version includes some bug fixes. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 79 Ratings 79 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! das rhetorician , 12/24/2020 NEW EDIT! Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I would love to be able to 2FA protect it like 1Password Byron LastPass owners can. Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... Also, the ability to EDIT password entries and to manually enter password credentials is essential and important to me and many other users! Please update this soon Mozilla! thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Bgzorro , 01/01/2021 Some of the latest features missing Did the developers just give up on this app for iPad or something? I see that the latest update was two weeks ago, and usually Facebook likes to update all of their apps every two days 🤨 While the app *is* functional, it lacks some of the updated features that are all available on the iPhone app and mostly available via the direct website — such as FB avatars stickers and the like (i do appreciate the extra choices for emoji reacts, tho’; i just wish there were more heart options with that). My iPad is on the latest OS (iPadOS 14) and is an iPad Air 2...this latest update of Facebook Messenger is an incomplete version of the latest update for its version on iPhone 😐 would be nice to access ALL of the latest features on this app for iPad, since there’s more space on my iPad than on on my iPhone to support it. Hopefully, y’all will come back with a new update of ALL the latest features soon... what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. AlexN.64-Bit , 04/08/2020 Staple features removed and NOW breaking bugs Honestly a lot of the features being removed I get. Especially with the app being rebuilt from the ground up. Within the last day or so going into any conversation *instead of just one from a recent bug report* I will be kicked out back to the conversation selection screen with the animation like I swiped to go back there myself but I didn’t. And even if I’m in the middle of typing it can happen to. On top of whatever was being typed being gone when *trying* to go back to the conversation. Also when it force backs you out some reason all the conversations flash out of existence for a few seconds. I was going to say maybe it was just my phone. I restarted my phone and uninstalled and reinstalled and even cleared app data to no avail. But it also happens on my IPhone SE which is on the latest 13.4.1 update like my 11 Pro max right now. So I pretty much can’t reliably use messenger now on any of my phones and have to go to a laptop. I’m also very confused as to the fact this just started happening today.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 80 Ratings 80 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! das rhetorician , 12/24/2020 NEW EDIT! Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I would love to be able to 2FA protect it like 1Password Byron LastPass owners can. Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... Also, the ability to EDIT password entries and to manually enter password credentials is essential and important to me and many other users! Please update this soon Mozilla! thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings xtosmia , 02/06/2021 Facebook needs to redesign all of its messaging apps I honestly can’t understand how they allow so many bugs and glitches in this app to go on and on forever. For starters, if you accidentally add a theme and emoji to a group chat, everyone gets notified. But then you can’t remove themes. You can only CHANGE to another theme. Who programmed this app? Seriously? Why can’t you remove themes completely? Please explain the reasoning. And hyperlink previews often don’t work. Sometimes they do. But not always, and it seems to be tied to themes. Group chats with themes tend to have this bug. And when you UNSEND a message, they feel the need to alert everyone about it. Why?? So annoying. Sometimes you message the wrong person/group. It happens. It should allow a clean unsend like Instagram messanger. With no trace or alerts. Facebook needs to sit down with Instagram and WhatsApp and go over the BEST and WORST features of each app and make ONE that works across ALL platforms. For example, allow LIKES in WhatsApp. Allow unsend without alerting everyone. Allow hyperlink previews. Alow GIFS to play (Gifs do not play in Instagram, but they do in WhatsApp & FB). This is a typical problem in the modern era. No broad level quality control. It’s whack-a-mole programming and new platform aquisition by everyone. And the unbelievable ad targeting you get due to bots constantly reading your messages. Wow. No privacy whatsoever. We need a change. Otherwise, the app works nicely. what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 82 Ratings 82 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! das rhetorician , 12/24/2020 NEW EDIT! Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I would love to be able to 2FA protect it like 1Password Byron LastPass owners can. Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... Also, the ability to EDIT password entries and to manually enter password credentials is essential and important to me and many other users! Please update this soon Mozilla! thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings xtosmia , 02/06/2021 Facebook needs to redesign all of its messaging apps I honestly can’t understand how they allow so many bugs and glitches in this app to go on and on forever. For starters, if you accidentally add a theme and emoji to a group chat, everyone gets notified. But then you can’t remove themes. You can only CHANGE to another theme. Who programmed this app? Seriously? Why can’t you remove themes completely? Please explain the reasoning. And hyperlink previews often don’t work. Sometimes they do. But not always, and it seems to be tied to themes. Group chats with themes tend to have this bug. And when you UNSEND a message, they feel the need to alert everyone about it. Why?? So annoying. Sometimes you message the wrong person/group. It happens. It should allow a clean unsend like Instagram messanger. With no trace or alerts. Facebook needs to sit down with Instagram and WhatsApp and go over the BEST and WORST features of each app and make ONE that works across ALL platforms. For example, allow LIKES in WhatsApp. Allow unsend without alerting everyone. Allow hyperlink previews. Alow GIFS to play (Gifs do not play in Instagram, but they do in WhatsApp & FB). This is a typical problem in the modern era. No broad level quality control. It’s whack-a-mole programming and new platform aquisition by everyone. And the unbelievable ad targeting you get due to bots constantly reading your messages. Wow. No privacy whatsoever. We need a change. Otherwise, the app works nicely. what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.8 out of 5 86 Ratings 86 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team! das rhetorician , 12/24/2020 NEW EDIT! Should also generate passwords just like it does for desktop I want to start off with this... I LOVE Mozilla as a company, entity of sorts; Firefox is an amazing web browser with great features and protections, Thunderbird is THE best desktop email application (I hope and pray maybe there could be an iOS/Android/Mobile version of Thunderbird); They make great products and services. I feel very let down by this mobile version of lockwise... it should generate passwords for the user also just like how it does in Firefox/Thunderbird... essentially, because it doesn’t generate passwords, this is a separate app you download for auto fill which Firefox for iOS already does and Chrome for iOS the same... Chrome for iOS also generates passwords... Slap that feature on there for us Mozilla!! And possibly allow us to protect lockwise with a form of 2FA like an authenticator or a security key! I have a Yubikey 5 NFC and I would love to be able to 2FA protect it like 1Password Byron LastPass owners can. Anyways... if you guys could add those features into this app it would be perfect, I am a diehard Mozilla fan but this app felt like it wasn’t really thought out... Also, the ability to EDIT password entries and to manually enter password credentials is essential and important to me and many other users! Please update this soon Mozilla! thank you all for all the effort you put into your products and services, I am a huge fan!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 87 Ratings 87 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 90 Ratings 90 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 91 Ratings 91 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

Ratings and Reviews See All 4.2 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 94 Ratings 94 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 96 Ratings 96 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

That includes the message that constantly tells you to use it or “try it out” even when already understand how it works. It’s annoying and distracting. The function of the “Double Tap to React” itself is annoying itself. If you accidentally double tap the action will carry out automatically. I’ve used it by accident so many times yet I’ve barely even used it once on purpose. It’s caused awkward misunderstandings and I’ve had to explain that it was a mistake. Can you not just make it so you can react when you hold down on the message? It would be so much more useful and secure. If you don’t want to change it because you might be worried that other people might enjoy this function, can you not just add it to the settings so the person can customize it to what they want? what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews See All 3.7 out of 5 97 Ratings 97 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

That includes the message that constantly tells you to use it or “try it out” even when already understand how it works. It’s annoying and distracting. The function of the “Double Tap to React” itself is annoying itself. If you accidentally double tap the action will carry out automatically. I’ve used it by accident so many times yet I’ve barely even used it once on purpose. It’s caused awkward misunderstandings and I’ve had to explain that it was a mistake. Can you not just make it so you can react when you hold down on the message? It would be so much more useful and secure. If you don’t want to change it because you might be worried that other people might enjoy this function, can you not just add it to the settings so the person can customize it to what they want? what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 97 Ratings 97 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Ratings and Reviews 2.3 out of 5 34 Ratings 34 Ratings Petermaz , 07/24/2017 Missing Marine info Thousands depend on Wind Speed and direction, Wave heights, and Water temperatures every summer here in WNY. But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

That includes the message that constantly tells you to use it or “try it out” even when already understand how it works. It’s annoying and distracting. The function of the “Double Tap to React” itself is annoying itself. If you accidentally double tap the action will carry out automatically. I’ve used it by accident so many times yet I’ve barely even used it once on purpose. It’s caused awkward misunderstandings and I’ve had to explain that it was a mistake. Can you not just make it so you can react when you hold down on the message? It would be so much more useful and secure. If you don’t want to change it because you might be worried that other people might enjoy this function, can you not just add it to the settings so the person can customize it to what they want? what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 100 Ratings 100 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but if it keeps showing up I’ll need to disable badges for Messenger. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 104 Ratings 104 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but if it keeps showing up I’ll need to disable badges for Messenger. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) what do you mean name taken , 07/21/2020 Glitchy to the point of unusable. For the longest time, Facebook messenger with my go to for communication. I didn’t have everyone’s phone number and not many of my contacts used something like WhatsApp, but everyone has a Facebook account. This app is so glitchy that it’s finally broken me of Facebook period. I never really used the service as a social media platform to begin with, but it was a decent communication service. Or would have been. For the majority of this year, the software has been unreliable, glitchy, and riddled with bugs. It consistently fails to give notifications, occasionally forgets that I had sent a message, and by far the worst glitch: it will randomly kick me out of conversations while I’m reading them or typing in them and put me back at the contacts screen. And of course, it doesn’t save what I had been typing. This means that something as simple as sending a message can require you to start typing it two or five times before you can actually send one. There is no excuse for a company that big to deliver software this crappy, especially given how much shady crap they are otherwise up to involving user data. Check please, I am done. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 104 Ratings 104 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but if it keeps showing up I’ll need to disable badges for Messenger. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 107 Ratings 107 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but if it keeps showing up I’ll need to disable badges for Messenger. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 109 Ratings 109 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but if it keeps showing up I’ll need to disable badges for Messenger. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) Silverramette , 01/15/2018 Pointless Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application—everyone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call? I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform. (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently. After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification. On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera. The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats—pinging every time there is a new comment. I’m not sure what a good use for this app is—it should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform. qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 110 Ratings 110 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 111 Ratings 111 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 114 Ratings 114 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 116 Ratings 116 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 120 Ratings 120 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4.

I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

I don’t like this at all 😞 STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 121 Ratings 121 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 125 Ratings 125 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 130 Ratings 130 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.6 out of 5 130 Ratings 130 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

Ratings and Reviews 4.1 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Proteus 846 , 06/01/2021 Phantom Notification Facebook Messenger is useful, but it has quite a few flaws and some of them are quite major. My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.5 out of 5 132 Ratings 132 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

Ratings and Reviews 4.1 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.5 out of 5 136 Ratings 136 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

This version includes bug fixes and stability improvements. Ratings and Reviews 3.5 out of 5 135 Ratings 135 Ratings JANTTiLA , 01/30/2021 Good start to combining passwords between browsers Easily syncs between Mac/iOS/PC instances of Firefox. Integrates with iOS very well. Works with Chrome, Firefox, others as described in documentation online. Exporting from with Desktop Safari 12 and 13 is a real chore as Apple is constantly striving for better privacy/security within its own ecosystem. However, export from Desktop Safari can be accomplished.. You need a third-party script called “mrc-converter-suite”. to export from Safari. The resulting CSV export file from mrc-converter-suite will have to be re-formatted to Justin Scott’s (deprecated) Password Exporter plugin CSV format. Note the needed format including enclosing quotes for each website. I used Excel. Finally, import the re-formatted CSV file using Justin Scott’s FireFox Password Exporter plugin (will also import) using Firefox Developer Edition Version 53. Once logged into Lockwise, the Safari passwords will be imported and able to be used with Lockwise. It’d be much easier if there was a way to import directly from Safari desktop, but there doesn’t appear to be an automated or easy way to accomplish this using any other program. Because I was ultimately successful in accomplishing this (imported 300 passwords) and I couldn’t do it with any out-of-the-box with any commercial/trial software I tried). Therefore, I’ll give it 4 stars (out of 5) but it takes time, effort and patience. tr0mbonedude , 02/28/2021 Good, needs a few more features This is a great start and I particularly like how it’s directly integrated into Firefox. I like that this app comes from one of the most trusted companies in terms of privacy. With all this said, I don’t yet think it stands out from other password managers like LastPass or 1Password. For example, LastPass structures it like somewhat like this: Password entry: - Entry Name - Website Address - Password - Additional Notes. Additionally, they have a versatile password generator and you can add and remove entries from any LastPass application. So LastPass makes it very quick and easy to manage passwords. If these features can be implemented, I’m switching over! Also, one cool thing that might draw more users into the Mozilla realm is a password Authenticator for two-factor authentication. I mean, history proves that you have been the authority of privacy and security. It’s worth a shot, I think. And if you can offer solutions like a versatile password manager, authenticator, and whatever other super awesome things you all offer, you will raise even more awareness to services like Mozilla VPN, and take back a considerable amount of market share from browsers that could care less about privacy. I’d love to see that. Keep up the great work! Thehiltyfamily , 09/30/2020 Two seriously needed features Great job on the core features of a password storage and management system. This app is in critical need of: 1) Editing options for stored passwords. Firefox lockwise on desktop is the only way to edit saved passwords at this time. When you change a password on mobile and then proceed to forget it when you’re back at your desk, you wish you had the ability to save it in lockwise on your phone. 2) Workarounds for choppy integration into iOS by design. Maybe a widget, some backend for the shortcuts feature, or some other way to get to lockwise fast. Apple tries to kill outside password managers on iOS by making keychain the only seamless password manager on iOS. Lockwise should work around those restrictions by beating Apple at its own game and giving users a way to get to them by, say, a back-tap gesture. Thanks, Locksise team!

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Than you. kristenju , 2021-08-02 Need major updates on functionality The app doesn’t sync properly with modifications made on the backend… we deleted double attendees and they are still showing on the app. Also, when we sell through the app, it doesn’t show us the mandatory fields and won’t let the “sale” complete but we didn’t realize it was becuase those fields were mandatory (no a message on why it doesn’t do anything) The app should also allow us to delete attendees .. goyalnilay , 2020-08-03 Keeps asking me to log in again and again Terrible unusable app. Just keeps showing me the login screen.

Ratings and Reviews 4.6 out of 5 11.6K Ratings 11.6K Ratings jeste130 , 11/09/2020 COVID-19 Love you guys, have a question for you. The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews 4.6 out of 5 11.6K Ratings 11.6K Ratings jeste130 , 11/09/2020 COVID-19 Love you guys, have a question for you. The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

Ratings and Reviews 4.6 out of 5 11.6K Ratings 11.6K Ratings jeste130 , 11/09/2020 COVID-19 Love you guys, have a question for you. The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago.

My latest issue is a notification badge on the app — on both my iPhone and iPad, and in the Facebook app on both as well on the [unnecessary] Messenger shortcut — that says I have one unread message. I’ve gone through my ENTIRE message history, message requests, and archive… I’ve read them all. I don’t know what this phantom notification is for, but I’ve had to disable badges for Messenger because of this annoyance so I occasionally miss messages now. As it stands, it’s a pathetic attempt by Facebook to get me to open their app. In some ways, this app has improved a lot with time. In others… not so much. There was a time when I used Messenger for as much as possible (especially with my friends who don’t have iPhones, since SMS texting is so laughably archaic) but now I use it as little as possible. That change is partially due to my paradigm shift related to how I view social media in general, but it’s mainly because of what Facebook has done with this app and their main service as well. At this point, I’m waiting for an innovative, useful, and fun replacement for Facebook — we’re overdue one, and hopefully it’ll be far superior. (Honestly, it wouldn’t be difficult. Just care about user privacy and you’ve already got a huge advantage over Facebook) JustinTyme1221 , 06/25/2021 Internal Browser JUNK!!!! Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

Messenger is getting a one star review from me of the sole reason that their internal browser is absolute garbage!!! it has wasted my time numerous times because I didn’t realize I was on their browser!! SMH!! I shouldnt have to look when I click the link it should open up in my default browser not Facebook messenger browser that doesn’t store my passwords for future use, auto fill my stuff or even work when I try to hit submit on an order!!Most recently I was trying to download professional photos from a professional photographer and it said I was saving them on the messenger browser but come to find out when I finished it didn’t save a single one and then I had to open it in chrome which I thought I was in the first place!! RAWR!!!! I am absolutely fed up with the amount of time I’ve wasted but not realizing I was in the messenger browser and the fact that I have no way to control this or turn it off I am annoyed and I am going to delete this application if you guys don’t make the necessary changes. And another thing when somebody tries to call you over messenger I should have the option to decline that call not have to sit and wait until it quits ringing!! Do you guys even test the functionality of your applications I’m beginning to question it!! qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

And I will get 10-20+ videos at a time from one person. Please upgrade the app to make videos 3 minutes max, instead of 20 seconds. It would make things so much better. I know I’m just one person. But maybe look at your data to see how many people use the video message function and if they are sending multiple at a time as well. Please and thank you. Edit. Also, maybe add a highlight to videos already viewed by me on my side. If I start watching them and that friend texts or sends a new video, the entire conversation jumps to the bottom and I lose my place. And trying to figure out where I left off in 20+ 20 second videos is a hassle; 40+ today(all at once). Like a yellow outline around the seen videos and blue around the ones I haven’t viewed yet. Something like that, that’s colorblind friendly lol. No purples and blues or greens and reds together, cuz they will blend and I and others like me wont be able to tell which is which 😂. Thank you qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

Ratings and Reviews 4.6 out of 5 11.6K Ratings 11.6K Ratings jeste130 , 11/09/2020 COVID-19 Love you guys, have a question for you. The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

And I will get 10-20+ videos at a time from one person. Please upgrade the app to make videos 3 minutes max, instead of 20 seconds. It would make things so much better. I know I’m just one person. But maybe look at your data to see how many people use the video message function and if they are sending multiple at a time as well. Please and thank you. Edit. Also, maybe add a highlight to videos already viewed by me on my side. If I start watching them and that friend texts or sends a new video, the entire conversation jumps to the bottom and I lose my place. And trying to figure out where I left off in 20+ 20 second videos is a hassle; 40+ today(all at once). Like a yellow outline around the seen videos and blue around the ones I haven’t viewed yet. Something like that, that’s colorblind friendly lol. No purples and blues or greens and reds together, cuz they will blend and I and others like me wont be able to tell which is which 😂. Thank you qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.

Ratings and Reviews 4.6 out of 5 11.6K Ratings 11.6K Ratings jeste130 , 11/09/2020 COVID-19 Love you guys, have a question for you. The Gov is searching for the reason for the rice on COVID-19 rates in Erie County try this. How about all the long lines in Amherst during the early voting period. People in lines waiting 2 or 3 hours tend to get closer together passing the time and the period of time fits his exposer times. Maybe he should ask the state board of Elections why they didn’t carry thru on his early suggestion of mailing ballots to all registered voters. He mentioned it 3 or 4 days in a row. Instead he got a system designed to fail with a one voting place per town and long lines in the largest towns. Example during early vote Amherst, and all others had one place to Vote but on Election Day voters had 29 locations and no lines. In fact Al Vaughters interviewed me and we talked about it. Did this also start the current COVID-19 INCREASE? Your guess is as good as mine and the time line fits. Jerry Stevens Gramarary , 05/22/2018 channel 4 Review I love channel 4 for all the News up dates. The daily weather reports ,social and special events all through Erie County and the surrounding area ... I’m grateful for the interruptions of local stations when there is special announcements in remaining to bring forth the news around the world . It is straight News from the source or sources and not FAKE News. Been a viewer since I can remember and will continue to choose Channel 4. Every news caster and behind the scenes workers should be proud of what they bring to channel 4 News Thank You Denise Dominiak Fan of Channel 4 News jes nemo , 07/10/2018 Notifications are pointless While I don’t have a problem with the actual television station I am quite unimpressed with this app. When I receive a notification for a story the reason I usually want to read the story is because I am unable to watch the news at whenever time so when I click on a notification that takes me to the headline with a single sentence covering it telling me to watch the news at “fill in the blank” it’s completely erroneous. I understand in some cases perhaps the story is being updated but this occurs even if I click the notification hours, or the next day. It will tell me at 0800 to watch the news for the full story the previous day at 1700, with no other update to the story. On one occasion I’ve actually emailed the station for information on a story and they no longer had information. It’s like clickbait without even that minuscule payout. It comes off as a lame ploy to just get more viewers as opposed to being an alternative news source for their station.

But the developers didn't think it was important. They need to get out more. STARCHILD , 12/16/2017 LOADED WITH AD INTERRUPTIONS Would be a great app, but if you try to read the weather forecast outlook, you get ad interruptions every few seconds! Very intrusive, so why bother reading forecast. I know things cost to support a “free app”, but what point does the app serve the customer when the info can’t get accessed due to tons of ad interruptions! Eventually your customer gets disgusted and dumps your app. I suggest you cut back on the add intrusions. Paddys-ipad , 06/10/2020 One year later - Still terrible The app lives down to it’s one star rating. I wish there was a NO Star rating. The app implementation is especially bad on the iPad, and that is where it should shine. If it was not associated with WIVB weather, I would have deleted it a year ago. And I may still, if I can find a useful replacement.

Tap Help in the Messenger app or visit facebook.com/help/messenger-app Ratings and Reviews 4.1 out of 5 1.2M Ratings 1.2M Ratings Blatisian , 09/21/2021 Video length is too short I have friends that talk through videos when I’m not available, instead of audio only or typing. And I will get 10-20+ videos at a time from one person. Please upgrade the app to make videos 3 minutes max, instead of 20 seconds. It would make things so much better. I know I’m just one person. But maybe look at your data to see how many people use the video message function and if they are sending multiple at a time as well. Please and thank you. Edit. Also, maybe add a highlight to videos already viewed by me on my side. If I start watching them and that friend texts or sends a new video, the entire conversation jumps to the bottom and I lose my place. And trying to figure out where I left off in 20+ 20 second videos is a hassle; 40+ today(all at once). Like a yellow outline around the seen videos and blue around the ones I haven’t viewed yet. Something like that, that’s colorblind friendly lol. No purples and blues or greens and reds together, cuz they will blend and I and others like me wont be able to tell which is which 😂. Thank you qhdms3886 , 02/03/2021 Overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate With school being online, I have been using messenger as my main medium of communication among the peers. The more I use it, the more I get annoyed at how poorly the app is made. When I have a few messages unread, it would make sense to guide me to the place where I left off when I open the chat. However, I have to scroll ALL the way up to figure out where in the conversation I had left from, so it is especially difficult when I am in a group chat and missed more than a dozen messages. It is also impossible to find the date and the time of each messages, which makes it take an even more time and effort from my end to go through every message to get to where I left off. This should be a basic function in all messenger programs by now, so I don’t understand why messenger wouldn’t carry such an essential function. It is not user-friendly, as the updates have been only adding stuff that no one would ever make use of while ignoring the basic necessities. I also can’t save or mark any messages if I need to go back to them. I truly hope you guys make the important updates soon. SullyGunther , 03/24/2021 Completely Unnecessary and terrible So to begin. The existence of Facebook messenger is absolutely unnecessary. There is already the Facebook app and I don’t see what the point is in having to switch to a different app just to see your messages. But also if you’re going to force me to use this app to see my messages from another app might as well make it work. For about a month now I’ve been stuck signed in to one of my pages. I can’t read any messages on my personal or any of my other business pages. So I deleted it and re-downloaded it. And now, it won’t let me sign in. I have tried signing in all day today and yesterday and it constantly gives me “ error your request cannot be completed at this time please try again later.” This is absolutely terrible. Get this thing fixed. I wish I could have the option to just use Messenger in the Facebook app. But since Zuck doesn’t want that I guess I don’t get it. If my businesses didn’t rely on it I would leave Facebook all together because of this. In summation, the app is terrible doesn’t work and I shouldn’t even need it in the first place.
