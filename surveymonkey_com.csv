Introduction & Goals Hotel Dieu Shaver (HDS) Health and Rehabilitation Centre is embarking upon a brand refresh which will be shaped by community feedback in order to make our services clearer to stakeholders. As a stakeholder in Niagara, we’d appreciate your input. The goals of our brand refresh are to ensure that the community and other stakeholders know that: HDS has a valuable partnership with Niagara Health, but we are not a Niagara Health site. We are an independent, publicly-funded rehabilitation hospital, with a separate Board of Trustees and a separate hospital Foundation for fundraising. HDS is Niagara's only rehabilitation and complex care hospital, and we serve the entire region - not just St. Catharines where we are located. HDS is a faith-based hospital which accepts everyone into our care. HDS is not a hotel, spa or wellness centre, which some people have questioned due to our current name. HDS is a key player in eliminating hallway healthcare by increasing patients' independence and quality of life, and decreasing patients' Emergency Room (ER) visits and stays in acute care hospitals. Our role will become stronger when our new building is complete in the coming years. (Inpatient Expansion Capital Project proposal has been submitted to the Ministry of Health. This fall, the aim is to advance to stage 2 of a 5-stage process). The survey should take 9-10 minutes to complete. Thank you for giving us your time, thoughts and opinions. OK Question Title * 1.

Renaming from ""Centre"" to ""Hospital"" Across Ontario, many rehabilitation facilities with inpatient services use ""hospital"" as part of their name. Furthermore, according to the Public Hospitals Act, Hotel Dieu Shaver is classified as a hospital in two categories: (1) Group E, a general rehabilitation hospital and (2) Group G, a hospital with <200 beds for chronic and complex care patients. (Note: HDS has 134 inpatient beds with the goal of expanding to 196.) The ""Hotel Dieu"" and ""Shaver"" names hold goodwill despite some confusion about the services offered by the current organization, Hotel Dieu Shaver Health and Rehabilitation Centre. Although it causes some confusion, the ""Hotel Dieu"" portion will be retained due to our founders and faith-based sponsor. Moving forward with renaming the hospital, which name is your top choice?
