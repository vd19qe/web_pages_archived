News May 27, 2020 The Canadian Press Like many Canadians, Erin Riediger cancelled her gym membership when the country went into lockdown in March. For the first few days of quarantine, the Winnipeg-based architect tried crafting her own yoga routine, to no avail. Then she found Alo Moves, an online membership-based yoga platform available for $9 a month on an annual basis, allowing her to improve her yoga skills on her own time, in her own space. ""I didn't think you could get any gains from working out at home,"" Riediger says. ""You can actually gain flexibility, gain strength without actually having to leave your home, which I didn't think was possible."" Riediger is one of many Canadians finding success in free or low-cost virtual home workout options during the lockdown. She says there were many times in her fitness journey that the $100 monthly yoga membership felt like a significant investment, one that required sacrifice in other areas of her life to maintain. Now that lockdown has taught her how effective and affordable working out from home can be, she's rethinking continuing this investment once gyms reopen safely again. ""I always felt like if I didn't have the membership I wasn't going to get enough out of my workouts,"" she says. ""But because the streaming service works so well, and I do feel like I'm making gains in yoga and in other areas that I wasn't practising at my home studio. I think that (going forward) I could do a blend."" She's currently exploring buying individual passes at a number of different fitness centres around Winnipeg while doing yoga at home for the $9 membership fee. In all, the cost of going this route would likely add up to less than her old yoga membership. It would also offer an element of convenience that in-person workouts simply don't. Riediger notes that attending a one-hour class at her yoga studio was at least a two-hour commitment, when factoring in time spent packing, commuting, and showering after the fact. Living room sessions, on the other hand, require little more than a few minutes of prep and cleanup. Many plans also offer flexibility in class length, so if you're lacking an hour to devote to working out, you can throw on a 10- or 20-minute video instead. The convenience factor is primarily why at-home fitness options like Peloton have become so popular over the last few years. The $2,950 workout bike — which comes with on-demand spin classes at varying lengths for $49 a month — has surged in popularity over the course of the pandemic, earning 2.6 million new subscribers between March 16 and April 30 alone. But even pre-lockdown, the bike was gaining traction within its key demographic: busy individuals who have disposable income, yet lack time to hit the gym. ""If I can get a great experience on my own time, in a convenient location at home, that's where the world has gone,"" says president William Lynch. ""Peloton offers that."" And as it turns out, working out in shorter bursts more frequently throughout the day may also be a healthier practice than hitting the gym for an intense, one-time workout after hours of sitting all day. That's according to Geoff Girvitz, director of Bang Fitness, a small Toronto gym that offers individualized training for around $40 a session. While Bang Fitness has remained closed over the duration of lockdown, Girvitz and his team of trainers have kept clients busy via remote workouts. They've also started offering free online drop-ins where trainers run public Zoom sessions for up to three hours, during which time patrons are free to come and go as they choose. The goal is to promote flexible ""micro and mini workouts,"" and Girvitz says he's seen such success with it that the gym will likely keep this program around long after Bang Fitness is safely allowed to reopen. ""We have this incredible opportunity to get off a call and immediately bust out some push-ups or some kettlebell swings,"" Girvitz says. These remote workout rooms also attempt to recreate the sense of community that gyms offer — a common draw for many consumers. But for those who rely on the accountability of a gym's social network, virtual workouts will never be enough. ""People crave human connection,"" Riediger says. And for others, working out for free will never be effective. Even Riediger admits that her $100 membership fee was costly enough to keep her from bailing on classes last minute. She doesn't feel the same guilt in quitting a virtual workout when the investment is the price of a few cups of coffee. So, while working out from home may always be the cheapest option, it's not necessarily the most effective. The most financially-sound workout plan is the one you stick to, and the lockdown hasn't changed that. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 26, 2020. Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version incorrectly stated the number of new Peloton subscribers. By Audrey Carleton, The Canadian Press Is it worth it to go back to the gym?

25100,20200706,mississauga.com,https://www.mississauga.com/news-story/10018192-restaurateurs-learn-to-pivot-amid-pandemic/,text/html,application/xhtml+xml,en,"Restaurateurs learn to pivot amid pandemic | Mississauga.com Restaurateurs learn to pivot amid pandemic News Jun 09, 2020 The Canadian Press Like many newly-reopened B.C. restaurants, Vancouver's Como Taperia has started performing temperature tests and doling out hand sanitizer at the door. It has also completely shifted focus, owner Shaun Layton says. Once a bustling tapas bar, Como was forced to pivot as it reopened in the second phase of B.C.'s coronavirus recovery plan. Where the restaurant normally seated 58, it now serves 29 patrons at a time and operates more like a market with seating than a bar. Tinned fish, liquor to-go, pre-prepared tapas dishes, and other packaged goods line large metal ULINE shelves, available for purchase from patrons eager to get in and out quickly. It's one of dozens of restaurants in B.C. moving swiftly to reopen under social distancing orders, including guidelines around handling food and beverages and limiting capacity to no more than 50 per cent at a time — measures that pose a challenge for many restaurateurs who are struggling to turn a profit with their usual patronage now reduced by half. In fact, Layton says Como would have lost money had it reopened for full-fledged dining service at 50 per cent capacity, so they were left with no option but to shift gears. ""You look at the actual how much it costs to start up the kitchen again, all of the prep for the food, and then to run at 50 per cent … It just wouldn't work,"" he says. Restaurants elsewhere in the country face a similar predicament. Montreal's Cafe Peche, for example, had only been open for a few weeks before lockdown orders were issued midway through March. Now facing the looming possibility of reopening in the next month while Quebec grapples with the highest coronavirus rates in the country, owner Jennifer Nguyen says she's completely rethinking her menu and space layout. ""I'll call it Peche 2.0,"" Nguyen says of her plans for what the cafe-bar will look like once it opens at half capacity. ""This is not the time to have a very elaborate menu … You have to be a very grab-n-go type of menu, gourmet sandwiches, stuff that you can just grab."" Nguyen also notes that the majority of the ingredients she'll be using for Peche's new, pared-back menu will be locally-sourced. As a restaurateur, she feels a responsibility to bring what business she can to local food suppliers that have taken similar financial hits because of the pandemic. She's also taking advantage of time spent under lockdown to do last-minute renovations on the restaurant, the building for which she feels lucky to own. Nguyen and her team took advantage of mortgage freezes available through their bank — a luxury many restaurateurs lack. In fact, Restaurants Canada estimated in April that 30 per cent of the country's restaurants will remain permanently closed after the pandemic subsides if widespread rent relief is not achieved. To this end, Layton notes that Como would not have been able to reopen had his landlord not been amenable to applying for Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA), in which property owners and tenants each pay cover 25 per cent of rent costs, while the federal government subsidizes the remaining 50. But even with commercial assistance, reopening on savings alone is difficult in an industry where average profit margins are in the single digits. He recommends that restaurateurs struggling take advantage of what they already have in storage, like collections of wine and canned goods. ""Everything we're selling in the market is stuff that used to be in our back storage room that we just put on the shelf,"" Layton says. ""And it looks really good, it's on brand, and it's stuff that people want."" Nguyen suggests taking a DIY approach to reopening as a socially-distanced business. She's done as much of the renovation, marketing, and supply-related tasks in prepping Peche for the public as she can on her own, primarily to cut costs associated with outsourcing labour. ""You have to get your hands dirty,"" she says. ""In these times, do as many jobs having many hats [as you can] to save on costs."" Both agree that the challenges COVID-19 has presented small business owners require agility and creativity to overcome. But restaurateurs at a complete loss for ideas about reopening should feel no shame in staying closed until they're ready, Layton says. It's too expensive to do otherwise. ""If you're not confident, then it's better to stay closed,"" he says. ""Close the noise out and really watch what everyone else is doing.""

To this end, Layton notes that Como would not have been able to reopen had his landlord not been amenable to applying for Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA), in which property owners and tenants each pay cover 25 per cent of rent costs, while the federal government subsidizes the remaining 50. But even with commercial assistance, reopening on savings alone is difficult in an industry where average profit margins are in the single digits. He recommends that restaurateurs struggling take advantage of what they already have in storage, like collections of wine and canned goods. ""Everything we're selling in the market is stuff that used to be in our back storage room that we just put on the shelf,"" Layton says. ""And it looks really good, it's on brand, and it's stuff that people want."" Nguyen suggests taking a DIY approach to reopening as a socially-distanced business. She's done as much of the renovation, marketing, and supply-related tasks in prepping Peche for the public as she can on her own, primarily to cut costs associated with outsourcing labour. ""You have to get your hands dirty,"" she says. ""In these times, do as many jobs having many hats [as you can] to save on costs."" Both agree that the challenges COVID-19 has presented small business owners require agility and creativity to overcome. But restaurateurs at a complete loss for ideas about reopening should feel no shame in staying closed until they're ready, Layton says. It's too expensive to do otherwise. ""If you're not confident, then it's better to stay closed,"" he says. ""Close the noise out and really watch what everyone else is doing.""

With more than two in five households out of work, nearly every Canadian has taken a financial hit, and those who haven't are living in fear of the possibility that they soon might. For young workers who've been laid off with little in the way of accumulated emergency savings to fall back on, things may feel scarier than they've ever been. The saving grace, says Shannon Lee Simmons, founder and certified financial planner at the New School of Finance in Toronto, is the newly announced Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). CERB offers a monthly $2,000 payment for a period of up to 16 weeks for those who wouldn't otherwise be eligible for Employment Insurance. Though the regulations around who's eligible for EI are opaque, as a general rule, EI is designated for Canadians who've lost their job through no fault of their own (those who believe they might be but aren't sure are typically encouraged to apply anyway). The criteria for CERB qualification are much broader. Any Canadian who has ceased working for a 14-day period due to COVID-19 is eligible. That includes wage earners, contract workers, or self-employed individuals; those who've had to stay home without pay to self-isolate or care for loved ones; and anyone else who hasn't been permanently laid off but has stopped receiving pay cheques. The CERB application portal is slated to open on April 6, while those who are eligible for EI can currently apply on the Government of Canada website: https://srv270.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/AW/introduction?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA The benefit should be enough to help many Canadians stay afloat without having to pursue extra work just to scrape by, Simmons says.

Employees and owners of small businesses and non-profit organizations should also soon be able to breathe a sigh of relief following the release of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, a federal benefit designed to help entrepreneurs cover up to 75 per cent of wages and keep their employees on payroll. A number of non-governmental resources are also available for workers in communities hit hardest by coronavirus-related layoffs, including the arts. As theatres and film sets around the country remain closed with no end in sight, a number of industry organizations have funding available for performers. Top of mind for fee-only financial planner Chris Enns — who serves Canada's creative community through his firm Rags to Reasonable — is the AFC, which has been providing workers in the entertainment industry short-term emergency financial assistance for essential bills since the 1950s. ""If you can't make your rent, you call them,"" Enns says. ""Even if you're not sure, just call."" A number of other industry organizations recently launched relief funds to help performers through the pandemic, Enns notes. The Toronto Arts Council's COVID Response Fund is offering up to $1,000 in grants for self-employed workers who have proof of lost revenue and are not eligible for EI. The National Arts Centre's #CanadaPerforms fund has accumulated $600,000 to pay entertainers who host online performances, like concerts or comedy shows held on Zoom, Twitch, or Instagram Live. Other funds and financial resources for artists and freelance workers can be found via CBC Arts here. Regardless of income level, the majority of Canadians are tightening their bootstraps to one degree or another. In times of extreme financial anxiety, Simmons and Enns agree that mindful spending is the name of the game. Both suggest taking an intentional approach to limiting your budget — if not for the sake of cutting costs, then as a way to regain the sense of control we've all recently lost in most other arenas of life. Try making a list of things you're willing to spend on and how much you can afford to spend on them. Start small: plan for just this week before taking on the whole month.

There's no shame in dipping into debt out of necessity when your income suddenly disappears, both Simmons and Enns say, noting that guilting yourself for it could do more harm than good. But managing this debt responsibly is essential. Simmons suggests taking a ""controlled burn"" approach. ""If you're going to go into debt, do it with your eyes wide open, so that on the other end you're not shocked by it and have a plan to pay it back,"" she says.

Federal figures showed that by Monday morning, 5.38 million people were getting payments through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. That includes some two million people who were previously approved for employment insurance benefits, but moved over to the new $2,000-a-month benefit that opened for applications one week ago. During the first week it was available, there were just under 3.5 million claims, including nearly 172,000 over the weekend. Figures provided by Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough's office show the government has received about six million claims for financial help in total since the crisis began about one month ago, when non-essential economic activity was paused due to public health concerns. The Liberals are likely to roll out more help soon to fill gaps in existing programs, such as by broadening the scope of the CERB to capture workers currently being left out. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada will make a rate announcement, issue an economic outlook, and could co-ordinate any new actions with the Finance Department, said Scotiabank deputy chief economist Brett House. ""The bank's work isn't quite done here,"" House said. ""If they're going to roll out additional measures, it's the perfect time to do so."" Since the start of March, the central bank has slashed its key interest rate to 0.25 per cent from 1.75 per cent, including two unscheduled cuts. It has also started a massive bond purchase program that goes beyond what the central bank did during the global financial crisis just over a decade ago. At the last of those unscheduled cuts, the bank indicated the target overnight rate was as low it could be. Last week, A C.D. Howe Institute panel of economists concluded there was little reason for the bank to move the key rate ""appreciably over the next year"" and instead should focus on keeping credit markets functioning. Panellist Thorsten Koeppl, a professor in the economics department at Queen's University, said he expects the rate to go to zero because the central bank is paying interest at the target rate instead of on a half-point band around the rate — removing any hurdle to putting the rate lower. Coupled with the rate announcement will be a monetary policy report that the bank says will provide its analysis of COVID-19's economic impact, and any foreseeable rebound to the closures of businesses and loss of jobs. More federal help for companies is to arrive next week in the form of an interest-free loan program to provide eligible small businesses and non-profits up to $40,000, with the promise of $10,000 being forgiven if paid by the end of 2022. Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre asked the government to increase the loan limit as an interim measure to help companies cover payroll costs while they await payments from a new wage subsidy program. When the government is able to pay the subsidy to eligible businesses in a few weeks, Poilievre proposed companies take the first tranche to pay off the increased loans provided by banks and credit unions. ""The government is stretched, so why not let our frontline lenders deliver the money now and take that strain off the governmental system,"" he said during a press conference. The 75 per cent wage subsidy program, approved by Parliament on Saturday, will pay up to $847 per week, per employee for up to 12 weeks. The subsidy is retroactive to March 15 and will be available to companies with a 15 per cent revenue drop in March, or 30 per cent decline in April or May. As part of an agreement to get swift approval of the $73 billion subsidy, the Liberals promised to cover gaps in its various aid programs. Also on Monday, a handful of Conservative business critics called on the Liberals to develop a plan to help the nation's restaurant, hospitality and tourism sectors. Many of those businesses were either among the first to close due to public health concerns related to COVID-19, or have seen dramatic declines as consumer spending drops. Among the ideas proposed are temporarily allowing owner-operators to qualify for the federal wage subsidy program as well as refunding a year's worth of GST remittances to small businesses. A report last week by the parliamentary budget officer estimated that refunding federal sales tax to small businesses would cost Ottawa's coffers about $12.9 billion This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 13, 2020.

That includes some two million people who were previously approved for employment insurance benefits, but moved over to the new $2,000-a-month benefit that opened for applications one week ago. During the first week it was available, there were just under 3.5 million claims, including nearly 172,000 over the weekend. Figures provided by Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough's office show the government has received about six million claims for financial help in total since the crisis began about one month ago, when non-essential economic activity was paused due to public health concerns. The Liberals are likely to roll out more help soon to fill gaps in existing programs, such as by broadening the scope of the CERB to capture workers currently being left out. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada will make a rate announcement, issue an economic outlook, and could co-ordinate any new actions with the Finance Department, said Scotiabank deputy chief economist Brett House. ""The bank's work isn't quite done here,"" House said. ""If they're going to roll out additional measures, it's the perfect time to do so."" Since the start of March, the central bank has slashed its key interest rate to 0.25 per cent from 1.75 per cent, including two unscheduled cuts. It has also started a massive bond purchase program that goes beyond what the central bank did during the global financial crisis just over a decade ago. At the last of those unscheduled cuts, the bank indicated the target overnight rate was as low it could be. Last week, A C.D. Howe Institute panel of economists concluded there was little reason for the bank to move the key rate ""appreciably over the next year"" and instead should focus on keeping credit markets functioning. Panellist Thorsten Koeppl, a professor in the economics department at Queen's University, said he expects the rate to go to zero because the central bank is paying interest at the target rate instead of on a half-point band around the rate — removing any hurdle to putting the rate lower. Coupled with the rate announcement will be a monetary policy report that the bank says will provide its analysis of COVID-19's economic impact, and any foreseeable rebound to the closures of businesses and loss of jobs. More federal help for companies is to arrive next week in the form of an interest-free loan program to provide eligible small businesses and non-profits up to $40,000, with the promise of $10,000 being forgiven if paid by the end of 2022. Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre asked the government to increase the loan limit as an interim measure to help companies cover payroll costs while they await payments from a new wage subsidy program. When the government is able to pay the subsidy to eligible businesses in a few weeks, Poilievre proposed companies take the first tranche to pay off the increased loans provided by banks and credit unions. ""The government is stretched, so why not let our frontline lenders deliver the money now and take that strain off the governmental system,"" he said during a press conference. The 75 per cent wage subsidy program, approved by Parliament on Saturday, will pay up to $847 per week, per employee for up to 12 weeks. The subsidy is retroactive to March 15 and will be available to companies with a 15 per cent revenue drop in March, or 30 per cent decline in April or May. As part of an agreement to get swift approval of the $73 billion subsidy, the Liberals promised to cover gaps in its various aid programs. Also on Monday, a handful of Conservative business critics called on the Liberals to develop a plan to help the nation's restaurant, hospitality and tourism sectors. Many of those businesses were either among the first to close due to public health concerns related to COVID-19, or have seen dramatic declines as consumer spending drops. Among the ideas proposed are temporarily allowing owner-operators to qualify for the federal wage subsidy program as well as refunding a year's worth of GST remittances to small businesses. A report last week by the parliamentary budget officer estimated that refunding federal sales tax to small businesses would cost Ottawa's coffers about $12.9 billion This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 13, 2020.

Howe News May 01, 2020 The Canadian Press TORONTO — Canada has officially entered a recession due to the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the C.D. Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared Friday. The council, which acts as an arbiter of business cycle dates in Canada, said the economy peaked in February before the steps taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus brought the economy to a standstill. ""Members agreed that by applying the council's methodology to the preliminary data available, Canada entered a recession in the first quarter of 2020,"" the council said in statement. There are no hard and fast rules for determining a recession, though a commonly used definition is two consecutive quarters of negative quarter-over-quarter economic growth. However, the C.D. Howe council defines a recession as a pronounced, persistent, and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity and it looks at both GDP and employment as its main measures. The March jobs report showed more than a million jobs were lost in the month, while a preliminary estimate by Statistics Canada suggested the economy contracted by nine per cent in the same month. ""The council agreed the magnitude of the contraction makes it extremely unlikely that any future adjustments will overturn the conclusion of a major drop in economic activity in the first quarter,"" the council said. While the decline in March was record setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month. The council, which normally meets once a year in December, plays a role similar to that of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States in declaring if a recession is occurring or has occurred. The ruling Friday came after a special meeting of the council this week.

In addition to complicating the shopping experience, the COVID-19 pandemic could have an impact on selection, price and financing, say experts. ""We do see that customers will probably be able to get better deals, but by making cash deals or finance deals rather than lease deals at this point,"" said Robert Karwel, senior manager of automotive practice in Canada for J.D. Power. The reason is that calculating residuals, or how much a vehicle is worth at the end of its lease, will be difficult because no one's got a good grip on what the used car market is going to look like. ""Right now you could probably safely assume that residuals are going to go down just because of people's fears of committing to buying a new vehicle right now,"" he said in an interview. That means car owners will receive a little less for their trade-ins and therefore have less of a downpayment for another vehicle. With about 41,000 cars each month projected to come off lease in April and May, companies are extending customer commitments as much as they can. That means a lot of used cars will be coming back in the third and fourth quarter of the year, he said. Spring is typically the key period for vehicle purchases or leases, but this year will be down. Retail sales plunged almost 50 per cent in March, and April is expected to be even worse because of lockdown initiatives across the country, although light trucks have been less affected. Canadian auto sales are expected to average 1.5 million this year, down nearly 23 per cent from the prior year before surging 37 per cent in 2021, says Thomas Feltmare, senior economist for TD Economics. ""Given both the magnitude of the shock and the current level of uncertainty, consumers are likely to forego near-term purchases and wait until better economic conditions prevail,"" he wrote in a report. While economic activity will begin to return next month, it will be gradual and could take awhile to return to the normal 1.9 million to two million level of annual sales in Canada. Sales could be slowest to recover in Quebec, which has had the country's most cases of COVID-19. Low oil prices could also hamper activity in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador as they did during the last oil shock several years ago. The decrease in equity markets may also help to slow interest in luxury vehicles, whose sales were hurt the most in March. Karwel said the best deals to be had will be cash purchases for 2019 models or less popular 2020 models. Deals on the most popular cars will be hard to come by because car manufacturers shuttered production. ""The customer is going to have to be satiated with kind of taking what they can find on a dealer's lot as we don't have a lot of inventory in the pipeline,"" he said. Chris Murray of Alta Corp Capital said buyers should shop around for good opportunities, particularly for 2019 vehicles, less popular brands and smaller vehicles. ""I don't know if I would want to come out and broad brush say everybody's going to fire sale everything,"" said the analyst covering Auto Canada Inc. ""I think what we're going to see is there'll be opportunities in certain types of vehicles. And given what we've seen so far, the dealerships that survive this downturn, they're going to be pretty eager to try to get some transactions done."" They'll offer incentives while car manufacturers will also step up with their own discounts. So far, Ford of Canada is providing up to six months of payment relief on new purchases of 2019 and 2020 Ford and Lincoln models financed through Ford Credit. Existing customers can get up to 90 days of financing or lease payment extensions. FCA says it is waiving payments for 120 days on all 2019 and 2020 models for all of its brands. The luxury business could face increased pressure, as Karwel said the shift away from leasing could produce better purchase incentives than were available last year. ""So I think for sure, there will be better opportunities for customers that wish to finance a luxury car at this point."" Fears of a recession could be a bigger threat to the industry than the virus. Demand would wane with potential customers less likely to commit to a purchase if they don't have jobs. Manufacturers will then be less inclined to put big incentives on cars because their ability to attract customers will be limited, he said. ""When the market is contracting, you're not looking at car manufacturers to try to gain share by increasing incentives, they will pull incentives back to a certain extent to preserve profitability.""

""We do see that customers will probably be able to get better deals, but by making cash deals or finance deals rather than lease deals at this point,"" said Robert Karwel, senior manager of automotive practice in Canada for J.D. Power. The reason is that calculating residuals, or how much a vehicle is worth at the end of its lease, will be difficult because no one's got a good grip on what the used car market is going to look like. ""Right now you could probably safely assume that residuals are going to go down just because of people's fears of committing to buying a new vehicle right now,"" he said in an interview. That means car owners will receive a little less for their trade-ins and therefore have less of a downpayment for another vehicle. With about 41,000 cars each month projected to come off lease in April and May, companies are extending customer commitments as much as they can. That means a lot of used cars will be coming back in the third and fourth quarter of the year, he said. Spring is typically the key period for vehicle purchases or leases, but this year will be down. Retail sales plunged almost 50 per cent in March, and April is expected to be even worse because of lockdown initiatives across the country, although light trucks have been less affected. Canadian auto sales are expected to average 1.5 million this year, down nearly 23 per cent from the prior year before surging 37 per cent in 2021, says Thomas Feltmare, senior economist for TD Economics. ""Given both the magnitude of the shock and the current level of uncertainty, consumers are likely to forego near-term purchases and wait until better economic conditions prevail,"" he wrote in a report. While economic activity will begin to return next month, it will be gradual and could take awhile to return to the normal 1.9 million to two million level of annual sales in Canada. Sales could be slowest to recover in Quebec, which has had the country's most cases of COVID-19. Low oil prices could also hamper activity in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador as they did during the last oil shock several years ago. The decrease in equity markets may also help to slow interest in luxury vehicles, whose sales were hurt the most in March. Karwel said the best deals to be had will be cash purchases for 2019 models or less popular 2020 models. Deals on the most popular cars will be hard to come by because car manufacturers shuttered production. ""The customer is going to have to be satiated with kind of taking what they can find on a dealer's lot as we don't have a lot of inventory in the pipeline,"" he said. Chris Murray of Alta Corp Capital said buyers should shop around for good opportunities, particularly for 2019 vehicles, less popular brands and smaller vehicles. ""I don't know if I would want to come out and broad brush say everybody's going to fire sale everything,"" said the analyst covering Auto Canada Inc. ""I think what we're going to see is there'll be opportunities in certain types of vehicles. And given what we've seen so far, the dealerships that survive this downturn, they're going to be pretty eager to try to get some transactions done."" They'll offer incentives while car manufacturers will also step up with their own discounts. So far, Ford of Canada is providing up to six months of payment relief on new purchases of 2019 and 2020 Ford and Lincoln models financed through Ford Credit. Existing customers can get up to 90 days of financing or lease payment extensions. FCA says it is waiving payments for 120 days on all 2019 and 2020 models for all of its brands. The luxury business could face increased pressure, as Karwel said the shift away from leasing could produce better purchase incentives than were available last year. ""So I think for sure, there will be better opportunities for customers that wish to finance a luxury car at this point."" Fears of a recession could be a bigger threat to the industry than the virus. Demand would wane with potential customers less likely to commit to a purchase if they don't have jobs. Manufacturers will then be less inclined to put big incentives on cars because their ability to attract customers will be limited, he said. ""When the market is contracting, you're not looking at car manufacturers to try to gain share by increasing incentives, they will pull incentives back to a certain extent to preserve profitability.""

Despite a spate of recent examples including the false alarm in Nunavut, several experts insist the phenomenon remains rare given the scope of tests administered in the country, which reached the benchmark of 1-million tests last week. Nevertheless, the scare in Pond Inlet, a tiny community on the northeastern coast of Baffin Island, raised many questions about how and why a COVID-19 test incorrectly came back positive, and whether it's possible to eliminate such errors, even if they are unusual. It didn't help that the mistake came amid a false positive scandal at an Ottawa laboratory where dozens of positive COVID-19 test results were rejected because of suspected errors. Then there was the much-publicized South Korean study that initially suggested COVID-19 reinfection was possible, until researchers said the findings were likely marred by false positive test results. Here's a look at what the experts have to say. HOW ACCURATE IS COVID-19 TESTING? Medical experts struggle with test accuracy all the time, Nunavut's chief public health officer said when the error came to light. Dr. Michael Patterson apologized for the inconvenience caused by the error, but noted Nunavut was far from the only region to have weathered problems: ""False positives are an issue that every jurisdiction has dealt with."" All lab tests have limitations, agrees Christine Nielsen, chief executive officer of the Canadian Society for Medical Laboratory Science. ""It's a terrible thing to say but there is no test that is perfect,"" says Nielsen. ""Even if we have 99.99 (per cent) accuracy, which is a fantastic number, it means that some of them need to have further investigation."" The accuracy of a medical test is measured in two ways: How often it correctly finds people with the disease, and how often it correctly finds people without the disease. Timothy Sly, a professor emeritus at Ryerson University's School of Occupational and Public Health, says this is the difference between a test's sensitivity and its specificity. ""The sensitivity is to say: How many of the true positives have we really got? And therefore, the others are false. And the specificity is: How many of the true negatives were we able to find? And of course the others are false,"" he says. Many factors can affect these outcomes, including the quality of the sample itself, the type of tools used to obtain and assess the sample, and at what stage of infection the sample was obtained. Patterson said that variability makes it hard to define a hard-and-fast accuracy rate. ""False negatives can occur, certainly up to 30 per cent of the time if we swab people who are asymptomatic and swab them too soon after they've been exposed to COVID-19,"" said Patterson. ""False positives depend a lot on the machine itself, but also how much COVID-19 is in a town or community that you're assessing or sampling. And so it's really hard to nail down a rate that applies to every machine that we use."" WHERE AND HOW DO THINGS GO WRONG? In the case of COVID-19, the virus that causes the disease — SARS-CoV-2 — is detected through a test known as a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test, or RT-PCR. It works by detecting viral RNA from a sample provided by the patient, usually by way of a throat swab or a nasopharyngeal swab. This can be uncomfortable for the person being tested, says Sly, noting the nasopharyngeal swab is a long flexible device that must reach deep into the nose to collect enough material. ""If you just poke it once it's not going to have a chance to pick up as much virus as if you touch the membrane and then twist a couple of times,"" he says. ""This little small variation on who's doing the task can change it."" PCR, meanwhile, is ""a very finicky test,"" says Nielsen. ""Let's say there's 100 steps in a process. If you make a mistake in step one, your mistake will be amplified,"" says Nielsen. ""This is one of those areas where standard operating procedures and how the lab functions — doing it the same way every single time — is really important."" WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF A FALSE POSITIVE RESULT? While both have bad outcomes, Nielsen suggests a false positive is better than a false negative in terms of public health risk because it forces the person to take extra — rather than inadequate — precautions. ""You at least go into isolation,"" she says, suggesting the alternative leads to community spread. Nevertheless, the personal cost can be high, especially if forced quarantine prevents someone from working or caring for dependants, Nielsen acknowledges. Add to that the general emotional and psychological toll wrought by isolation and a COVID-19 diagnosis, and the impact is considerable. Plus, there are still infection risks to incorrectly assuming you have COVID-19, says University of Toronto professor Ashleigh Tuite of the Dalla Lana school of public health. ""The challenge with the false positive is that if you think that you're infected, do you isolate yourself and then assume that you're immune and then behave in a way that isn't protective against reinfection?"" she says. False positives also trigger further public health costs since staff must identify the infected person's close contacts and make sure they are not infected. In the case of Nunavut, more than a dozen people were tested for COVID-19 but none of those tests came back positive. False positives can also inflate the true scope of infection in a particular community — numbers which shape public policy around containment measures such as school closures, the shutdown of non-essential services and public gatherings. WHAT CHECKS ARE IN PLACE? Even if a test has proven to be extremely reliable in development, things can go awry once it's deployed in the real world. That's what appeared to happen with the handheld Spartan Cube, an Ottawa-made diagnostic device that was recently recalled because its swab design made it prone to false negatives. Health Canada downgraded its authorization to research use only. ""That's not unusual where you have a very, very well-performing test in very idealized situations and then when you do it in real life, it never works as well,"" says Tuite. The Spartan recall is an example of Canada's regulatory system working well, adds Nielsen. She says laboratories also have lots of quality control measures to limit the possibility of machine and device errors, while the power of regular observation is not to be underestimated. ""You'll have somebody that's in ICU and all of their labs come back normal but you hear that they're in multi-organ failure, that suggests to you that there's something wrong."" In detailing what went wrong in Nunavut, Patterson described diagnostic tests as just ""one piece"" of ""an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection."" He credited the work of public health nurses to trace contacts in quelling fears the disease had spread. ""When in doubt, we aim to err on the side of caution,"" he said.

The incoming third-year political science student at Lakehead University in Orillia, Ont., who typically spends summers working in the non-profit sector, is facing a summer of unemployment and wondering where the money for rent and groceries will come from as the economy slowly emerges from a government mandated lockdown. Amyot, who prefers to use gender-neutral pronouns, has exhausted most of the resources accessible to them and anticipates leaning on local food pantries to get by. ""Hopefully aid comes soon,"" Amyot says. ""If it starts to get into late May, you know, I'll have to look at my options. But right now it's kind of a week-by-week thing."" The economic fallout from the coronavirus has cut off scores of young Canadians from summer jobs and internships, which usually help them bridge gaps between tuition payments. And up until April 22, when Ottawa introduced the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), students like Amyot were left uncovered by existing aid programs — namely the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which requires applicants to have made at least $5,000 in 2019. CESB offers students who aren't eligible for CERB $1,250 per month (or $1,750 per month for those with dependents or disabilities) between May and August. It's part of a nine-billion dollar aid package for post-secondary students and recent graduates that also includes wage subsidies for employers with Canada Summer Jobs, enhanced and extended research grants, and increased weekly student loan payments. The sum of a summer's CESB cheques comes out to be more than what Amyot would typically make at a non-profit job earning minimum wage, though applications for CESB won't open until May 15. Critics say the funding is coming too late, as nearly two months of lockdown without aid has left students scrambling to make ends meet. ""I have applied for some work, mostly essential work in grocery stores and things like that,"" says Amyot. ""I haven't heard back; the few that I did hear back from had filled the positions at the time … And I am at the point where I'm going to run out of groceries in a few days."" Amyot feels lucky to qualify for CESB at all, as large sectors of students are not eligible for the program, including international students. Claudia Rupnik, incoming fourth-year student at Queen's University and news editor of the Queen's Journal, says international students at the school are ""feeling very much like they have fallen through the cracks."" Coronavirus-related travel restrictions have prevented many from returning home for the summer, so a large portion of students are stuck in Canada without money to live on. Rupnik also notes that while the CESB offers enough to cover basic needs, it's far lower than what most students say they'd earn through a paid internship. A number of her peers, including those planning to apply for CESB, are now left re-evaluating how they'll pay for school come fall. In the meantime, Queen's University has released two-million dollars in bursary funding for students having trouble paying their immediate bills, with a fraction dedicated specifically to international graduate students. Other schools and students' societies across the country are offering similar emergency scholarships for those slipping through the cracks of federal aid, including Brock University, the University of Toronto, the University of Victoria, and MacEwan University, among others. Students who aren't eligible for federal funding should consult their schools' bursary schemes. Meanwhile, the federal government has injected enough funding into the Canada Summer Jobs program to create up to 70,000 jobs for youth in retail, communications, transport, agriculture, and other industries. Those interested should consult the federal Job Bank to start their search. Students who are still coming out dry should speak up, says Adam Brown, chair of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations. Brown says he and his team are currently advocating for students across the country at the federal level — and from what he's seen, Ottawa is listening.

This year is different. Come Friday, there will be no cheque in the mail, no wad of cash and no e-transfer that Carpinone will send her landlord. ""We pay close to $6,000 a month in rent and were able to meet that in April, but we're absolutely not able to meet that in May,"" said Carpinone. ""When we paid that in April it was after not operating for two weeks, so it was a really big hit to our cash flow. Some other big payments came through at that time and they put us in a position where it would be completely impossible or at best really not a good business decision to take what little we have left to pay rent."" The pandemic has meant a slew of commercial renters — from the country's smallest businesses like Carpinone's to the chains like A&W Food Services of Canada Inc. — have faced tough conversations with their landlords about being unable to cover rent. Many tried to keep the payments flowing in March and April, when COVID-19 shutdowns were still fresh, but the pandemic's prolonged nature means that all has changed in May. ""I think it's going to be worse than April 1,"" said Tim Sanderson, an executive vice president and national lead of retail for JLL Canada, a brokerage firm that invests in industrial, commercial, retail, residential and hotel real estate. Lots of businesses don't have the liquidity to carry them through for months on end, he said. ""And when you're looking at your list of things to pay, rent is usually a rather large nut."" Landlords are working out what to do about tenants that can't pay on a case-by-case situation, and most are hesitant to make blanket statements allowing all tenants to forgo rent because each one performs differently, he said. Sanderson believes landlords are asking themselves if the tenant seeking a break on rent is a business that wasn't going to survive regardless of COVID-19. ""And am I, as a landlord, by deferring or abating rent, throwing good money after bad?"" RioCan, Choice Properties, and CT real estate investments trusts all said in early April that they were working with tenants who need support because of the financial challenges brought on by the pandemic. Loblaw landlord Choice Properties REIT said it would grant 60-day rent deferrals on a case-by-case basis for ""qualifying"" small businesses and independent tenants. Cadillac Fairview, which owns some of the country's highest profile malls including the Eaton Centre in Toronto and Pacific Centre in Vancouver, confirmed to The Canadian Press that between 20 and 25 per cent of its tenants have paid rent for this month and the company has deferred April and May rents for a ""significant"" amount of its retail clients. Sanderson predicts top-tier malls will see some impacts around commercial rent, but will ultimately survive. Malls in second-tier markets will be more affected, he thinks. Olivier Benchaya, a partner in the restructuring and insolvency group of Richter, said he's seen mall landlords allowing tenants to defer rent, but warns that even that situation creates the ""perfect storm of financial strain"" on businesses. ""You have to make up that rent at some point,"" he said, which might include interest and will likely come as tenants are still struggling to pay suppliers for delivered goods that can't be sold at full price. Covering a backlog of rent and all the other mounting costs will be tough for small businesses that often have less cash on hands than their larger counterparts. A recent survey from the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses revealed that more than half of small businesses are not able to pay rent without support, and this number is as high as 75 per cent for the hospitality sector. About 54 per cent of those surveyed trust their landlord to be reasonable, and 75 per cent believe the cost of commercial rent that cannot be paid due to COVID-19 revenue losses should be shared between governments, landlords and tenants. Carpinone's landlord is willing to participate in the federal government's Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, which provides forgivable loans to cover 50 per cent of three monthly rent payments. The loans will be forgiven if the mortgaged property owner agrees to reduce the eligible small business tenants’ rent by at least 75 per cent for three months under a rent forgiveness agreement. Details are still be working out, so Carpinone and her landlord will wait to find out more before pursuing it. In the meantime, they have agreed to a rent deferral. ""To somehow have to turn a business that's already just a break-even business into something profitable so that I can repay them that extra $6,000, that stresses me out,"" she said.

46660,20200626,mississauga.com,https://www.mississauga.com/news-story/9972604-how-indoor-malls-are-changing-under-new-rules/,text/html,application/xhtml+xml,en,"How indoor malls are changing under new rules | Mississauga.com How indoor malls are changing under new rules News May 07, 2020 The Canadian Press TORONTO — Consumers should get ready for a new world of retail as indoor shopping mall operators across the country prepare to reopen their doors with an abundance of COVID-19 precautions in the coming weeks. From the staff hired to manage the flow of people to new measures that include pre-ordering items, the traditional afternoon at the mall isn't going to look anything like it did before the pandemic. But at this point, mall owners say their priority is establishing clear guidelines that customers understand. ""The worst thing you can do is confuse people,"" said Jonathan Gitlin, president and chief operating officer of RioCan REIT, which owns indoor malls Burlington Centre and Yonge and Eglinton Centre in Toronto. ""People want to feel safe. They want to feel like they're in an organized environment."" Shopping centres in Manitoba were allowed to resume operations on May 4 under strict guidelines from local health officials, while other provinces are expected to follow with their own rules for how non-essential businesses should operate when they reopen. Several mall operators spoke with The Canadian Press about the changes they're rolling out: REDUCED HOURS Getting shopping centres back on their feet will take significant time and effort, so expect truncated operating hours at most locations. Sal Iacono, executive vice president of operations at Cadillac Fairview, said the company's malls will run on shortened days which leave room for employees to review what needs improvement. Most locations will generally open a couple hours later, and close earlier than usual, to accommodate the changes. ""Retailers will have to take time to properly prepare, retrain staff and remerchandise,"" he said. Mall operators recommended that shoppers refer to their websites for the latest store hours. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC Forget wandering aimlessly around the mall under the new safety measures. The goal is to closely monitor the number of shoppers inside the building to prevent overcrowding, and keep everyone moving in a steady flow that avoids unnecessary criss-crossing of people. Floor decals with directions and additional staff hired to maintain the flow of traffic will keep the movement in check. Expect malls to designate some entrances solely for coming into the building while others will be reserved exclusively as exits. ""If there's six or seven entrances currently, three will be entrances and three exits,"" Iacono said. Inside the mall, retailers themselves will control how many shoppers walk into their store. Anyone who exceeds the maximum capacity will have to wait outside the storefront in a roped off line-up. It's one of the greater complexities of reopening malls, since none of these spaces were designed for the sheer volume of people waiting outside a store. Those complexities might lead to innovations in the coming months, Iacono suggested, such as phone apps that provide expected wait times at certain stores, similar to the way crowd management is handled by theme parks at the most popular attractions. Food courts will operate in a reduced capacity that discourages people from gathering for long periods of time. Some malls operators say they'll rope off parts of the seating to maintain physical distancing, while others have said in exceptional cases the food courts will be take-out only to prevent congregating. MASKS AND GLOVES Some grocery stores require shoppers to wear masks, but those rules won't apply at most malls. Instead, expect building management to stock each entrance with an abundance of hand sanitizer dispensers. ""We can't impose upon our tenants, the retailers, to insist that face masks are worn in their stores,"" Gitlin said of RioCan's current policy. ""What we'll do is encourage people to wear masks when they enter our shopping centres. But at this point, it's not our intention to deny entry for those who aren't."" Some retail analysts suggest malls could distribute gloves to shoppers, but that would be a costly endeavour that most — but not all — operators have ruled out. ""At this point, we're still determining exactly what we're going to do in that regard,"" Gitlin said. ""There shouldn't be reliance on every facility you visit to provide you with some of those basic protections."" Janitors will circulate through high-traffic areas frequently cleaning washrooms, doors, digital directories, hand rails, garbage cans, and elevator buttons. And expect to become acquainted with Plexiglas, as shopping centres owned by Ivanhoe Cambridge, which include Fairview Pointe-Claire in Montreal and CrossIron Mills in Rocky View, Alta., will install the protective layer at the guest services counter, said spokeswoman Katherine Roux Groleau. CURBSIDE PICKUP While many outdoor malls began offering curbside pickup weeks ago, the more traditional malls are expected to follow closely behind. RioCan announced it's rolling out a program it's dubbing Curbside Collect at its properties which designates sections of the parking lot where shoppers can pull up and collect pre-ordered items. ""We think that this is an innovative way to adhere to the way in which consumers now will be shopping in at least the short term, but I also think for the long term,"" Gitlin said. Other mall operators say they'll experiment will similar ideas, though ones located in downtown cores may struggle to manage vehicle traffic on city streets. Follow @dfriend on Twitter.

Gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 8.2 per cent in the first quarter, including a 7.2-per-cent drop in March as restrictions by public health officials began rolling out, including school closures, border shutdowns and travel restrictions. Preliminary information indicates an 11 per cent drop in GDP for April, but the statistics agency said that figure is likely to be revised as more information becomes available. Similarly, the agency said first-quarter figures are likely to have larger than usual revisions in subsequent data releases. Some numbers had to be estimated because they were not available. Early indications are that March and April could end up as the largest consecutive monthly declines on record. The drastic drop in gross domestic product likely doesn't fully reflect the experience of every Canadian, said BMO chief economist Douglas Porter, noting GDP is just one barometer of how the pandemic has affected the domestic economy. ""You don't get the entire picture just from GDP and even from employment (figures) because policy-makers have stepped up with such unusual and aggressive actions that a lot of the common metrics just don't apply 100 per cent in this episode,"" Porter said in an interview. The federal response to date totals about $152 billion in direct spending. The parliamentary budget officer has said that could leave the deficit at $260 billion, with a national debt north of $950 billion. A preliminary estimate released by the Finance Department on Friday showed deficit of $21.8 billion for the fiscal year that closed in March. The figure will still be subject to revisions, which may land it closer to the government's last estimate of $26.6 billion. The monthly fiscal monitor also showed the debt pushed past $794.4 billion. Many of the items adding to this year's deficit are expected to show up in supplementary spending estimates. The documents will be scrutinized for four hours in mid-June based on the motion the adopted this week to put the Commons on extended hiatus until late September. Budget officer Yves Giroux told a Commons committee on Friday that would provide parliamentarians little opportunity to properly scrutinize tens of billions, if not over $100 billion in proposed spending. ""It comes up as a very expensive four hours potentially for Canadian taxpayers,"" he said. ""The amount of scrutiny for this unprecedented spending will also be unprecedented, but for the wrong reasons."" The latest federal spending figures showed $41.44 billion has been paid to 8.29 million people through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, and $7.9 billion in wage subsidies to 181,883 companies. Other figures posted Friday showed $652.6 million has been paid in student emergency aid to 478,399 people. MPs on the Commons finance committee were told Thursday the cost of the wage susbidy program is somewhat less than the original $73-billion estimate. Consultations are underway to understand why companies aren't accessing the program that covers 75 per cent of salaries, subject to a cap of $847 per week, per employee.

Several mall operators spoke with The Canadian Press about the changes they're rolling out: REDUCED HOURS Getting shopping centres back on their feet will take significant time and effort, so expect truncated operating hours at most locations. Sal Iacono, executive vice president of operations at Cadillac Fairview, said the company's malls will run on shortened days which leave room for employees to review what needs improvement. Most locations will generally open a couple hours later, and close earlier than usual, to accommodate the changes. ""Retailers will have to take time to properly prepare, retrain staff and remerchandise,"" he said. Mall operators recommended that shoppers refer to their websites for the latest store hours. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC Forget wandering aimlessly around the mall under the new safety measures. The goal is to closely monitor the number of shoppers inside the building to prevent overcrowding, and keep everyone moving in a steady flow that avoids unnecessary criss-crossing of people. Floor decals with directions and additional staff hired to maintain the flow of traffic will keep the movement in check. Expect malls to designate some entrances solely for coming into the building while others will be reserved exclusively as exits. ""If there's six or seven entrances currently, three will be entrances and three exits,"" Iacono said. Inside the mall, retailers themselves will control how many shoppers walk into their store. Anyone who exceeds the maximum capacity will have to wait outside the storefront in a roped off line-up. It's one of the greater complexities of reopening malls, since none of these spaces were designed for the sheer volume of people waiting outside a store. Those complexities might lead to innovations in the coming months, Iacono suggested, such as phone apps that provide expected wait times at certain stores, similar to the way crowd management is handled by theme parks at the most popular attractions. Food courts will operate in a reduced capacity that discourages people from gathering for long periods of time. Some malls operators say they'll rope off parts of the seating to maintain physical distancing, while others have said in exceptional cases the food courts will be take-out only to prevent congregating. MASKS AND GLOVES Some grocery stores require shoppers to wear masks, but those rules won't apply at most malls. Instead, expect building management to stock each entrance with an abundance of hand sanitizer dispensers. ""We can't impose upon our tenants, the retailers, to insist that face masks are worn in their stores,"" Gitlin said of RioCan's current policy. ""What we'll do is encourage people to wear masks when they enter our shopping centres. But at this point, it's not our intention to deny entry for those who aren't."" Some retail analysts suggest malls could distribute gloves to shoppers, but that would be a costly endeavour that most — but not all — operators have ruled out. ""At this point, we're still determining exactly what we're going to do in that regard,"" Gitlin said. ""There shouldn't be reliance on every facility you visit to provide you with some of those basic protections."" Janitors will circulate through high-traffic areas frequently cleaning washrooms, doors, digital directories, hand rails, garbage cans, and elevator buttons. And expect to become acquainted with Plexiglas, as shopping centres owned by Ivanhoe Cambridge, which include Fairview Pointe-Claire in Montreal and CrossIron Mills in Rocky View, Alta., will install the protective layer at the guest services counter, said spokeswoman Katherine Roux Groleau. CURBSIDE PICKUP While many outdoor malls began offering curbside pickup weeks ago, the more traditional malls are expected to follow closely behind. RioCan announced it's rolling out a program it's dubbing Curbside Collect at its properties which designates sections of the parking lot where shoppers can pull up and collect pre-ordered items. ""We think that this is an innovative way to adhere to the way in which consumers now will be shopping in at least the short term, but I also think for the long term,"" Gitlin said. Other mall operators say they'll experiment will similar ideas, though ones located in downtown cores may struggle to manage vehicle traffic on city streets. Follow @dfriend on Twitter.

Food courts will operate in a reduced capacity that discourages people from gathering for long periods of time. Some malls operators say they'll rope off parts of the seating to maintain physical distancing, while others have said in exceptional cases the food courts will be take-out only to prevent congregating. MASKS AND GLOVES Some grocery stores require shoppers to wear masks, but those rules won't apply at most malls. Instead, expect building management to stock each entrance with an abundance of hand sanitizer dispensers. ""We can't impose upon our tenants, the retailers, to insist that face masks are worn in their stores,"" Gitlin said of RioCan's current policy. ""What we'll do is encourage people to wear masks when they enter our shopping centres. But at this point, it's not our intention to deny entry for those who aren't."" Some retail analysts suggest malls could distribute gloves to shoppers, but that would be a costly endeavour that most — but not all — operators have ruled out. ""At this point, we're still determining exactly what we're going to do in that regard,"" Gitlin said. ""There shouldn't be reliance on every facility you visit to provide you with some of those basic protections."" Janitors will circulate through high-traffic areas frequently cleaning washrooms, doors, digital directories, hand rails, garbage cans, and elevator buttons. And expect to become acquainted with Plexiglas, as shopping centres owned by Ivanhoe Cambridge, which include Fairview Pointe-Claire in Montreal and CrossIron Mills in Rocky View, Alta., will install the protective layer at the guest services counter, said spokeswoman Katherine Roux Groleau. CURBSIDE PICKUP While many outdoor malls began offering curbside pickup weeks ago, the more traditional malls are expected to follow closely behind. RioCan announced it's rolling out a program it's dubbing Curbside Collect at its properties which designates sections of the parking lot where shoppers can pull up and collect pre-ordered items. ""We think that this is an innovative way to adhere to the way in which consumers now will be shopping in at least the short term, but I also think for the long term,"" Gitlin said.

From the staff hired to manage the flow of people to new measures that include pre-ordering items, the traditional afternoon at the mall isn't going to look anything like it did before the pandemic. But at this point, mall owners say their priority is establishing clear guidelines that customers understand. ""The worst thing you can do is confuse people,"" said Jonathan Gitlin, president and chief operating officer of RioCan REIT, which owns indoor malls Burlington Centre and Yonge and Eglinton Centre in Toronto. ""People want to feel safe. They want to feel like they're in an organized environment."" Shopping centres in Manitoba were allowed to resume operations on May 4 under strict guidelines from local health officials, while other provinces are expected to follow with their own rules for how non-essential businesses should operate when they reopen. Several mall operators spoke with The Canadian Press about the changes they're rolling out: REDUCED HOURS Getting shopping centres back on their feet will take significant time and effort, so expect truncated operating hours at most locations. Sal Iacono, executive vice president of operations at Cadillac Fairview, said the company's malls will run on shortened days which leave room for employees to review what needs improvement. Most locations will generally open a couple hours later, and close earlier than usual, to accommodate the changes. ""Retailers will have to take time to properly prepare, retrain staff and remerchandise,"" he said. Mall operators recommended that shoppers refer to their websites for the latest store hours. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC Forget wandering aimlessly around the mall under the new safety measures. The goal is to closely monitor the number of shoppers inside the building to prevent overcrowding, and keep everyone moving in a steady flow that avoids unnecessary criss-crossing of people. Floor decals with directions and additional staff hired to maintain the flow of traffic will keep the movement in check. Expect malls to designate some entrances solely for coming into the building while others will be reserved exclusively as exits. ""If there's six or seven entrances currently, three will be entrances and three exits,"" Iacono said. Inside the mall, retailers themselves will control how many shoppers walk into their store.

""Retailers will have to take time to properly prepare, retrain staff and remerchandise,"" he said. Mall operators recommended that shoppers refer to their websites for the latest store hours. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC Forget wandering aimlessly around the mall under the new safety measures. The goal is to closely monitor the number of shoppers inside the building to prevent overcrowding, and keep everyone moving in a steady flow that avoids unnecessary criss-crossing of people. Floor decals with directions and additional staff hired to maintain the flow of traffic will keep the movement in check. Expect malls to designate some entrances solely for coming into the building while others will be reserved exclusively as exits. ""If there's six or seven entrances currently, three will be entrances and three exits,"" Iacono said. Inside the mall, retailers themselves will control how many shoppers walk into their store. Anyone who exceeds the maximum capacity will have to wait outside the storefront in a roped off line-up. It's one of the greater complexities of reopening malls, since none of these spaces were designed for the sheer volume of people waiting outside a store. Those complexities might lead to innovations in the coming months, Iacono suggested, such as phone apps that provide expected wait times at certain stores, similar to the way crowd management is handled by theme parks at the most popular attractions. Food courts will operate in a reduced capacity that discourages people from gathering for long periods of time. Some malls operators say they'll rope off parts of the seating to maintain physical distancing, while others have said in exceptional cases the food courts will be take-out only to prevent congregating. MASKS AND GLOVES Some grocery stores require shoppers to wear masks, but those rules won't apply at most malls. Instead, expect building management to stock each entrance with an abundance of hand sanitizer dispensers. ""We can't impose upon our tenants, the retailers, to insist that face masks are worn in their stores,"" Gitlin said of RioCan's current policy. ""What we'll do is encourage people to wear masks when they enter our shopping centres. But at this point, it's not our intention to deny entry for those who aren't."" Some retail analysts suggest malls could distribute gloves to shoppers, but that would be a costly endeavour that most — but not all — operators have ruled out. ""At this point, we're still determining exactly what we're going to do in that regard,"" Gitlin said. ""There shouldn't be reliance on every facility you visit to provide you with some of those basic protections."" Janitors will circulate through high-traffic areas frequently cleaning washrooms, doors, digital directories, hand rails, garbage cans, and elevator buttons.

CURBSIDE PICKUP While many outdoor malls began offering curbside pickup weeks ago, the more traditional malls are expected to follow closely behind. RioCan announced it's rolling out a program it's dubbing Curbside Collect at its properties which designates sections of the parking lot where shoppers can pull up and collect pre-ordered items.

Shopping centres in Manitoba were allowed to resume operations on May 4 under strict guidelines from local health officials, while other provinces are expected to follow with their own rules for how non-essential businesses should operate when they reopen. Several mall operators spoke with The Canadian Press about the changes they're rolling out: REDUCED HOURS Getting shopping centres back on their feet will take significant time and effort, so expect truncated operating hours at most locations. Sal Iacono, executive vice president of operations at Cadillac Fairview, said the company's malls will run on shortened days which leave room for employees to review what needs improvement. Most locations will generally open a couple hours later, and close earlier than usual, to accommodate the changes. ""Retailers will have to take time to properly prepare, retrain staff and remerchandise,"" he said. Mall operators recommended that shoppers refer to their websites for the latest store hours. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC Forget wandering aimlessly around the mall under the new safety measures. The goal is to closely monitor the number of shoppers inside the building to prevent overcrowding, and keep everyone moving in a steady flow that avoids unnecessary criss-crossing of people. Floor decals with directions and additional staff hired to maintain the flow of traffic will keep the movement in check. Expect malls to designate some entrances solely for coming into the building while others will be reserved exclusively as exits. ""If there's six or seven entrances currently, three will be entrances and three exits,"" Iacono said. Inside the mall, retailers themselves will control how many shoppers walk into their store. Anyone who exceeds the maximum capacity will have to wait outside the storefront in a roped off line-up. It's one of the greater complexities of reopening malls, since none of these spaces were designed for the sheer volume of people waiting outside a store. Those complexities might lead to innovations in the coming months, Iacono suggested, such as phone apps that provide expected wait times at certain stores, similar to the way crowd management is handled by theme parks at the most popular attractions. Food courts will operate in a reduced capacity that discourages people from gathering for long periods of time. Some malls operators say they'll rope off parts of the seating to maintain physical distancing, while others have said in exceptional cases the food courts will be take-out only to prevent congregating. MASKS AND GLOVES Some grocery stores require shoppers to wear masks, but those rules won't apply at most malls. Instead, expect building management to stock each entrance with an abundance of hand sanitizer dispensers. ""We can't impose upon our tenants, the retailers, to insist that face masks are worn in their stores,"" Gitlin said of RioCan's current policy. ""What we'll do is encourage people to wear masks when they enter our shopping centres. But at this point, it's not our intention to deny entry for those who aren't."" Some retail analysts suggest malls could distribute gloves to shoppers, but that would be a costly endeavour that most — but not all — operators have ruled out.

By David Friend, The Canadian Press Top Stories How indoor malls are changing under new rules News May 07, 2020 The Canadian Press TORONTO — Consumers should get ready for a new world of retail as indoor shopping mall operators across the country prepare to reopen their doors with an abundance of COVID-19 precautions in the coming weeks. From the staff hired to manage the flow of people to new measures that include pre-ordering items, the traditional afternoon at the mall isn't going to look anything like it did before the pandemic.
