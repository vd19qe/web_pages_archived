Learn more about recent changes below. Note: Formats, titles, and features vary by library, so some of these changes may not apply to your library's digital collection. March 3, 2020 When a hold becomes available for you, you'll now have the option to borrow it or have it delivered later. The ""deliver later"" option keeps you at the front of the wait list but passes that copy of the title to the next person in line. This feature gives you more control over your holds, so you can borrow and read titles when it's most convenient for you. The auto-checkout option for holds has been removed. Instead, all users can go to their Holds page to borrow available holds. Your library's digital collection now has a notification section to alert you about available holds. Note: You'll still receive email notifications about your holds. Other recent updates August 19, 2019 The sign-in page has been refreshed with new graphics and a simplified library selector for consortia. The Facebook and OverDrive account sign-in options have been removed. Instead, all users will need to sign in with a library card. Note: If you used Facebook or an OverDrive account, you can still access your loans, holds, and other activity by signing in with your library card. Take a short survey to share your feedback about these changes or your OverDrive experience.
