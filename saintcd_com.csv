Once more, in troubled times when public worship has to be restricted, we are called to pray in “the domestic church,” always aware of the promise of Jesus, “Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them” (Matthew 18:20). In this challenging time Lord Jesus Christ, our true physician and healer, be merciful to us and bring us your aid in these troubled times. Heal all our sickness and every affliction of your people. Drive out our infirmities of soul and body; free us from all disease and especially from this pandemic. We place in your gentle heart the elderly, the frail, those with a disability, children, young people and families, our Indigenous peoples, those who are poor, lonely and isolated. As you walk with us, free them from fear, and give them patience and hope, together with our loving care. We place our trust in you, our Risen Lord, who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen. For those who care for the sick Father of mercies, we thank you for all who care for the sick. When they diagnose, give them patience. When they protect the vulnerable, give them your protection. When they work to heal, give them strength. When they comfort, give them consolation. When they are tired, give them rest. When they are discouraged, bring them your hope. May we welcome and respect them as we support one another in this time of trial. For those seeking a cure for the virus Come, Holy Spirit, enlighten the minds of women and men of medical science who are working to find a cure for this viral infection. Guide their research and help them discover what you provide in creation, sure ways of control, protection, inoculation and healing. Strengthen them in their tireless work and enrich in them the virtue of hope. For those who govern and represent us Eternal Wisdom, guide our leaders called to serve us in our nation, its provinces and territories. May they respond to the challenges of this affliction with prudence and sound judgement. With prudence, may their planning alleviate the economic burdens, compensate for losses, protect employment, and ensure ample food and shelter for the poor, the isolated and the marginalized. Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary This short prayer to Our Lady has been prayed by Christians in troubled times since the third century. We fly to your protection, O Holy Mother of God; despise not our petitions in our hour of need, but deliver us always from all dangers, O glorious and blessed Virgin. Amen. Our Lady of Good Health Prayer from the shrine of Our Lady of Good Health, Church of la Maddalena and tomb of Saint Camillus, Rome. Mother of Mercy, Our Lady of Good Health, in visiting St. Elizabeth and in watching at the foot of the Cross of your suffering Son, you showed your solidarity with suffering humanity. Hear the prayer of all your infirm children who come to you with the certainty of finding a Mother who welcomes, heals and comforts them. Mother of our Saviour and our Mother, hear the intentions that we entrust to your intercession: heal our illnesses; transform our tears into prayer and our sufferings into moments of growth; change our loneliness into contemplation and our waiting into hope; assist us in our final hours and transform our death into resurrection. Amen. An Act of Spiritual Communion My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love you above all things, and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and I unite myself wholly to you. Amen. Many Masses are being live streamed. Check Live Streaming Masses around the Diocese of St. Catharines . For the faithful departed Be merciful, Lord Jesus, to all who have entered eternity because of this virus. Comfort and strengthen their families and friends with the hope of your glorious Resurrection. Eternal rest grant to them, O Lord, and may light perpetual shine upon them. + May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace. Amen.

The Act of Contrition You may know an Act of Contrition from receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation. The Act of Contrition is a way to acknowledge that we are sorry for our sins and that we, with God’s help, will try to not sin again. It is an acknowledgement of our dependence on the mercy of God. In this time of COVID-19, when we are participating in Mass by means of Spiritual Communion, the Act of Contrition is one way to acknowledge our sins and ask for God’s forgiveness. While praying an Act of Contrition does not replace the need for Sacramental Confession once we are able to attend it again, praying an Act of Contrition, after reflecting on our sins, is a good way to open ourselves to the mercy and love of God and to declare to Him and ourselves, our intention to not sin again. Various Acts of Contrition Eight different Acts of Contrition as suggested in the Rite of Penance For Families Holy Week at Home from Liturgical Press Adaptions of the Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter Vigil, and Easter Sunday rituals.

Once more, in troubled times when public worship has to be restricted, we are called to pray in “the domestic church,” always aware of the promise of Jesus, “Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them” (Matthew 18:20). In this challenging time Lord Jesus Christ, our true physician and healer, be merciful to us and bring us your aid in these troubled times. Heal all our sickness and every affliction of your people. Drive out our infirmities of soul and body; free us from all disease and especially from this pandemic. We place in your gentle heart the elderly, the frail, those with a disability, children, young people and families, our Indigenous peoples, those who are poor, lonely and isolated. As you walk with us, free them from fear, and give them patience and hope, together with our loving care. We place our trust in you, our Risen Lord, who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen. For those who care for the sick Father of mercies, we thank you for all who care for the sick. When they diagnose, give them patience. When they protect the vulnerable, give them your protection. When they work to heal, give them strength. When they comfort, give them consolation. When they are tired, give them rest. When they are discouraged, bring them your hope. May we welcome and respect them as we support one another in this time of trial. For those seeking a cure for the virus Come, Holy Spirit, enlighten the minds of women and men of medical science who are working to find a cure for this viral infection. Guide their research and help them discover what you provide in creation, sure ways of control, protection, inoculation and healing. Strengthen them in their tireless work and enrich in them the virtue of hope. For those who govern and represent us Eternal Wisdom, guide our leaders called to serve us in our nation, its provinces and territories. May they respond to the challenges of this affliction with prudence and sound judgement. With prudence, may their planning alleviate the economic burdens, compensate for losses, protect employment, and ensure ample food and shelter for the poor, the isolated and the marginalized. Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary This short prayer to Our Lady has been prayed by Christians in troubled times since the third century. We fly to your protection, O Holy Mother of God; despise not our petitions in our hour of need, but deliver us always from all dangers, O glorious and blessed Virgin. Amen. Our Lady of Good Health Prayer from the shrine of Our Lady of Good Health, Church of la Maddalena and tomb of Saint Camillus, Rome. Mother of Mercy, Our Lady of Good Health, in visiting St. Elizabeth and in watching at the foot of the Cross of your suffering Son, you showed your solidarity with suffering humanity. Hear the prayer of all your infirm children who come to you with the certainty of finding a Mother who welcomes, heals and comforts them. Mother of our Saviour and our Mother, hear the intentions that we entrust to your intercession: heal our illnesses; transform our tears into prayer and our sufferings into moments of growth; change our loneliness into contemplation and our waiting into hope; assist us in our final hours and transform our death into resurrection. Amen. An Act of Spiritual Communion My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love you above all things, and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and I unite myself wholly to you. Amen. Many Masses are being live streamed. Check Live Streaming Masses around the Diocese of St. Catharines . For the faithful departed Be merciful, Lord Jesus, to all who have entered eternity because of this virus. Comfort and strengthen their families and friends with the hope of your glorious Resurrection. Eternal rest grant to them, O Lord, and may light perpetual shine upon them. + May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace. Amen.

Once more, in troubled times when public worship has to be restricted, we are called to pray in “the domestic church,” always aware of the promise of Jesus, “Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them” (Matthew 18:20). In this challenging time Lord Jesus Christ, our true physician and healer, be merciful to us and bring us your aid in these troubled times. Heal all our sickness and every affliction of your people. Drive out our infirmities of soul and body; free us from all disease and especially from this pandemic. We place in your gentle heart the elderly, the frail, those with a disability, children, young people and families, our Indigenous peoples, those who are poor, lonely and isolated. As you walk with us, free them from fear, and give them patience and hope, together with our loving care. We place our trust in you, our Risen Lord, who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen. For those who care for the sick Father of mercies, we thank you for all who care for the sick. When they diagnose, give them patience. When they protect the vulnerable, give them your protection. When they work to heal, give them strength. When they comfort, give them consolation. When they are tired, give them rest. When they are discouraged, bring them your hope. May we welcome and respect them as we support one another in this time of trial. For those seeking a cure for the virus Come, Holy Spirit, enlighten the minds of women and men of medical science who are working to find a cure for this viral infection. Guide their research and help them discover what you provide in creation, sure ways of control, protection, inoculation and healing. Strengthen them in their tireless work and enrich in them the virtue of hope. For those who govern and represent us Eternal Wisdom, guide our leaders called to serve us in our nation, its provinces and territories. May they respond to the challenges of this affliction with prudence and sound judgement. With prudence, may their planning alleviate the economic burdens, compensate for losses, protect employment, and ensure ample food and shelter for the poor, the isolated and the marginalized. Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary This short prayer to Our Lady has been prayed by Christians in troubled times since the third century. We fly to your protection, O Holy Mother of God; despise not our petitions in our hour of need, but deliver us always from all dangers, O glorious and blessed Virgin. Amen. Our Lady of Good Health Prayer from the shrine of Our Lady of Good Health, Church of la Maddalena and tomb of Saint Camillus, Rome. Mother of Mercy, Our Lady of Good Health, in visiting St. Elizabeth and in watching at the foot of the Cross of your suffering Son, you showed your solidarity with suffering humanity. Hear the prayer of all your infirm children who come to you with the certainty of finding a Mother who welcomes, heals and comforts them. Mother of our Saviour and our Mother, hear the intentions that we entrust to your intercession: heal our illnesses; transform our tears into prayer and our sufferings into moments of growth; change our loneliness into contemplation and our waiting into hope; assist us in our final hours and transform our death into resurrection. Amen. An Act of Spiritual Communion My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love you above all things, and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and I unite myself wholly to you. Amen. Many Masses are being live streamed. Check Live Streaming Masses around the Diocese of St. Catharines . For the faithful departed Be merciful, Lord Jesus, to all who have entered eternity because of this virus. Comfort and strengthen their families and friends with the hope of your glorious Resurrection. Eternal rest grant to them, O Lord, and may light perpetual shine upon them. + May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace. Amen. A Litany of Saints of Mercy In the Communion of Saints, we are always surrounded by many unseen friends whose lives embodied care for the sick.

Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary This short prayer to Our Lady has been prayed by Christians in troubled times since the third century. We fly to your protection, O Holy Mother of God; despise not our petitions in our hour of need, but deliver us always from all dangers, O glorious and blessed Virgin. Amen. Our Lady of Good Health Prayer from the shrine of Our Lady of Good Health, Church of la Maddalena and tomb of Saint Camillus, Rome. Mother of Mercy, Our Lady of Good Health, in visiting St. Elizabeth and in watching at the foot of the Cross of your suffering Son, you showed your solidarity with suffering humanity. Hear the prayer of all your infirm children who come to you with the certainty of finding a Mother who welcomes, heals and comforts them. Mother of our Saviour and our Mother, hear the intentions that we entrust to your intercession: heal our illnesses; transform our tears into prayer and our sufferings into moments of growth; change our loneliness into contemplation and our waiting into hope; assist us in our final hours and transform our death into resurrection. Amen. An Act of Spiritual Communion My Jesus, I believe that you are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love you above all things, and I desire to receive you into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace you as if you were already there and I unite myself wholly to you. Amen. Many Masses are being live streamed. Check Live Streaming Masses around the Diocese of St. Catharines .
