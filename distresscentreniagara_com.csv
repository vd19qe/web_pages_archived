The St. Catharines Jaycees conducted a survey among social service agencies to determine the need for a phone-in service. The response was overwhelming and a 24-hour telephone service commenced under the name Care-Line. On March 16th,1984 the name was changed to the Distress Centre of St. Catharines District. The reason for this change was to maintain consistency with our provincial organization, Distress Centre Ontario.
