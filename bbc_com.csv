But what makes it so tiring - and how can we reduce ‘Zoom fatigue’? Y Your screen freezes. There’s a weird echo. A dozen heads stare at you. There are the work huddles, the one-on-one meetings and then, once you’re done for the day, the hangouts with friends and family. Since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, we’re on video calls more than ever before – and many are finding it exhausting. But what, exactly, is tiring us out? BBC Worklife spoke to Gianpiero Petriglieri, an associate professor at Insead, who explores sustainable learning and development in the workplace, and Marissa Shuffler, an associate professor at Clemson University, who studies workplace wellbeing and teamwork effectiveness, to hear their views. Is video chat harder? What’s different compared to face-to-face communication? Being on a video call requires more focus than a face-to-face chat, says Petriglieri. Video chats mean we need to work harder to process non-verbal cues like facial expressions, the tone and pitch of the voice, and body language; paying more attention to these consumes a lot of energy. “Our minds are together when our bodies feel we're not. That dissonance, which causes people to have conflicting feelings, is exhausting. You cannot relax into the conversation naturally,” he says. Delays on phone or conferencing systems of 1.2 seconds made people perceive the responder as less friendly or focused Silence is another challenge, he adds. “Silence creates a natural rhythm in a real-life conversation. However, when it happens in a video call, you became anxious about the technology.” It also makes people uncomfortable. One 2014 study by German academics showed that delays on phone or conferencing systems shaped our views of people negatively: even delays of 1.2 seconds made people perceive the responder as less friendly or focused. You might also like: • Why grocery shelves won't be empty for long • Coronavirus isolation is creating new couples • How to work from home, the right way An added factor, says Shuffler, is that if we are physically on camera, we are very aware of being watched. “When you're on a video conference, you know everybody's looking at you; you are on stage, so there comes the social pressure and feeling like you need to perform. Being performative is nerve-wracking and more stressful.” It’s also very hard for people not to look at their own face if they can see it on screen, or not to be conscious of how they behave in front of the camera. How are the current circumstances contributing? Yet if video chats come with extra stressors, our Zoom fatigue can’t be attributed solely to that. Our current circumstances – whether lockdown, quarantine, working from home or otherwise – are also feeding in.

It is the distress that every time you see someone online, such as your colleagues, that reminds you we should really be in the workplace together,” he says. “What I'm finding is, we’re all exhausted; It doesn't matter whether they are introverts or extroverts. We are experiencing the same disruption of the familiar context during the pandemic.” Then there’s the fact that aspects of our lives that used to be separate – work, friends, family – are all now happening in the same space. The self-complexity theory posits that individuals have multiple aspects – context-dependent social roles, relationships, activities and goals – and we find the variety healthy, says Petriglieri. When these aspects are reduced, we become more vulnerable to negative feelings. Imagine if you go to a bar, and in the same bar you talk with your professors, meet your parents or date someone, isn’t it weird? That’s what we’re doing now – Gianpiero Petriglieri “Most of our social roles happen in different places, but now the context has collapsed,” says Petriglieri. “Imagine if you go to a bar, and in the same bar you talk with your professors, meet your parents or date someone, isn’t it weird? That's what we're doing now… We are confined in our own space, in the context of a very anxiety-provoking crisis, and our only space for interaction is a computer window.” Shuffler says a lack of downtime after we’ve fulfilled work and family commitments may be another factor in our tiredness, while some of us may be putting higher expectations on ourselves due to worries over the economy, furloughs and job losses. “There's also that heightened sense of ‘I need to be performing at my top level in a situation’… Some of us are kind of over-performing to secure our jobs.” But when I’m Zooming my friends, for example, shouldn’t that relax me? Lots of us are doing big group chats for the first time, whether it’s cooking and eating a virtual Easter dinner, attending a university catch-up or holding a birthday party for a friend. If the call is meant to be fun, why might it feel tiring? Part of it, says Shuffler, is whether you’re joining in because you want to or because you feel you ought to – like a virtual happy hour with colleagues from work. If you see it as an obligation, that means more time that you’re ‘on’ as opposed to getting a break. A proper chat with friends will feel more social and there will be less ‘Zoom fatigue’ from conversations where you’ve had a chance to be yourself. It doesn't matter whether you call it a virtual happy hour, it's a meeting, because mostly we are used to using these tools for work – Gianpiero Petriglieri Big group calls can feel particularly performative, Petriglieri warns. People like watching television because you can allow your mind to wander – but a large video call “is like you're watching television and television is watching you”. Large group chats can also feel depersonalising, he adds, because your power as an individual is diminished. And despite the branding, it may not feel like leisure time. “It doesn't matter whether you call it a virtual happy hour, it's a meeting, because mostly we are used to using these tools for work.” So how can we alleviate Zoom fatigue? Both experts suggest limiting video calls to those that are necessary. Turning on the camera should be optional and in general there should be more understanding that cameras do not always have to be on throughout each meeting. Having your screen off to the side, instead of straight ahead, could also help your concentration, particularly in group meetings, says Petriglieri. It makes you feel like you’re in an adjoining room, so may be less tiring. In some cases it’s worth considering if video chats are really the most efficient option. When it comes to work, Shuffler suggests shared files with clear notes can be a better option that avoids information overload. She also suggests taking time during meetings to catch up before diving into business. “Spend some time to actually check into people's wellbeing,” she urges. “It’s a way to reconnect us with the world, and to maintain trust and reduce fatigue and concern.” Building transition periods in between video meetings can also help refresh us – try stretching, having a drink or doing a bit of exercise, our experts say. Boundaries and transitions are important; we need to create buffers which allow us to put one identity aside and then go to another as we move between work and private personas. And maybe, says Petriglieri, if you want to reach out, go old-school. “Write a letter to someone instead of meeting them on Zoom. Tell them you really care about them.” Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on FacebookShare on Linkedin Share on Whatsapp Share Around the BBC Explore the BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Parental Guidance Contact the BBC Get Personalised NewslettersCopyright © 2020 BBC.

I If you’ve been balancing your laptop on a precarious stack of cookbooks, or lamented VPN speed from your kitchen table, you’re not alone. Ever since restrictions were put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19, companies have been scrambling to enable colleagues to work from home. As we adapt to the much-cited ‘new normal’, some experts are predicting that remote work might be here to stay. This is leaving many nervously eyeing up our makeshift home desk set-ups, and wondering how on earth we can handle the backache. But for some, remote working is just another day at the office. Thousands of workers in the Netherlands benefit from the country’s astonishingly flexible work culture. While the percentage of employed persons usually working remotely before the coronavirus outbreak lingered at around 4.7% in the UK, and 3.6% in the US, 14.1% of the Netherland’s workforce reports usually working away from the office. The Netherlands has long led the global shift toward remote work, with only Finland catching up in recent years while other countries lag behind. “When the pandemic started, I suddenly found myself playing the part of a remote-work coach for my wife and our neighbours,” says Yvo van Doorn, an Amsterdam-based engineer. “I was suddenly answering questions about home networks and video conferencing. It was eye-opening because I’d taken these things for granted.” Across the globe, many companies have found that the shift to remote work has been a less-than-smooth transition. Setting up usually office-based staff with computer equipment, and recalibrating working culture to keep employees connected, has been a significant shift for most. But for the Netherlands, the country’s already sizeable remote workforce means that the adjustment has been much less dramatic. It was eye-opening because I’d taken these things for granted - Yvo van Doorn “Dutch people had certain advantages when we went into lockdown,” explains van Doorn, whose employer Auth0 gives all workers the option for flexible work, offers a budget to create a comfortable and productive home working set up, and helps to arrange coworking spaces if needed. “We’re fortunate enough to be a country where 98% of homes have high-speed internet access, and the Netherlands has the right combination of technology, culture, and approach to make remote working successful. I’m judged on whether I deliver value, not on the fact that I sit at a desk for nine hours a day. ” A culture ripe for remote work As we begin to tentatively imagine a post-pandemic future, there will be many who find themselves looking wistfully toward van Doorn’s permanent home working set-up.

Many Dutch have been working from home, even pre-pandemic (Credit: Getty Images) Results of a recent US poll, conducted mid-crisis, suggest that 59% of remote workers would like to continue to work remotely as much as possible once restrictions on businesses and school closures are fully lifted. Major international companies, including Barclays and Twitter, have already suggested that expensive city office space may become a thing of the past. Both have already hinted at an end to the commute for its employees, planning potentially long-term remote work policies for after the pandemic. Aukje Nauta, an organisational psychology professor at the University of Leiden, who is researching how companies can enhance individuals in a dynamic work context, believes that employers could look toward the Netherlands for inspiration as they consider how best to implement remote-work policies and set up virtual offices. “Values such as democracy and participation are deeply rooted in the Dutch working culture, so managers place more trust in their workers than elsewhere in the world,” she says. “For example, ING bank [an influential Dutch company based in Amsterdam] now has a policy on unlimited holidays implemented for pilot groups of workers, who can take as much holiday as they want as long as their tasks do not suffer. Employers elsewhere are now learning that employees can be trusted to work from home, and I believe that in post-corona[virus] times, smart combinations of working from home and meeting in real life will emerge more and more worldwide.” Due to the accelerating forces caused by Covid, other countries are in a turbulent learning curve - Bart Götte But there are also broader economic and social contexts that enable remote work to flourish in the Netherlands. “Physical infrastructure is well developed, and public and commercial remote-working facilities are plentiful,” says Bart Götte, a business futurist and psychologist based in Amersfoort. “Public libraries have reinvented themselves as massive and comfortable modern working spaces, and there are an enormous number of small, quality coffee shops that service the remote workforce. Employers in the Netherlands have also seized the opportunity to cut costs and become more productive – they need less square metres of expensive office space, and strict sick pay legislation in the Netherlands means that they are motivated to make sure that their workers have healthy working facilities at home.” The explosion of remote working facilities in the Netherlands hasn’t just benefited employees of large companies. Around 1.1 million workers in the Netherlands are self-employed, and the normalisation of the virtual office has made it easy for freelancers and small business start-ups to operate without the need for dedicated office space. “I’m a solo-preneur and currently work from home,” says Lara Wilkens, an event producer in Amsterdam. “Working from home is better for the environment, and we have great paid co-working spaces as well as many free places where you can trade a service for a workspace.” A traffic sign in North Holland urging Dutch residents to stay home in April. Throughout Covid-19, the country has been proactive with stay-at-home measures (Credit: Getty Images) ‘The power to reorganise’ With the Netherlands displaying an admirable level of trust in its employees and an understanding of the digital frameworks needed to support remote work, other countries may now be looking towards the Dutch as they plan a post-Covid future. Many countries struggle with a culture of presenteeism, with 83% of UK employees reporting having observed pressure within their workplace to ‘show up’ regardless of whether their mental or physical health allows it. In the US, around 15% of homes do not have broadband, and one in five employees report feeling guilty about taking time away from the office, worrying that this might make them seem less committed to their job. While the Netherlands displays a combination of attuned infrastructure, investment in a digital future, and culture of trust that makes it an aspirational archetype of a well-oiled remote world, companies in other countries still have much to understand and adapt to as Covid-19 ushers in a less office-based future. “What we have seen over the last few months is the power to reorganise,” says Götte. “We are now working remotely on a massive global scale. I think that we will come out of this crisis more digitally literate, aware that many of us are capable of working remotely, with more autonomy, and perhaps an aspiration to become more independent. Due to the accelerating forces caused by Covid, other countries are in a turbulent learning curve, and people are rethinking old policies, procedures, customs, and values. When circumstances change so massively we simply have to learn by doing, and that is perhaps the most important lesson.” Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on FacebookShare on Linkedin Bookmark this article Share Similar Articles Remote Control 1Why Zoom calls are so exhausting worklife 2The evolution of home fitness Remote Control 3The luxury of having outdoor space Around the BBC Explore the BBC Home News Sport Weather iPlayer Sounds CBBC CBeebies Food Bitesize Arts Taster Local Three Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Parental Guidance Contact the BBC Get Personalised NewslettersCopyright © 2020 BBC.

It was the deepest decline since the government began keeping records in 1947 and three times more severe than the prior record of 10% set in 1958. Reduced spending on services such as healthcare drove the fall. Economists have said they expected to see the sharpest drop in the second quarter, with recovery thereafter. But as virus cases in the US surge and some areas re-impose restrictions on activity, the rebound is showing signs of stalling. More than 1.4 million people filed new claims for unemployment last week, up slightly from the prior week for the second week in a row. Other data points to spending cuts and falls in confidence in July. Job losses Jerome Powell, the head of America's central bank, on Wednesday warned of renewed slowdown, describing the downturn as the ""most severe in our lifetimes"". He urged further government spending to help American households and businesses weather the crisis. That call was echoed by other business leaders on Thursday as the figures brought into focus the scale of the economic crisis facing the country. ""The staggering news of the historic decline of the gross domestic product in the second quarter should shock us all,"" said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby group. ""This jarring news should compel Congress to move swiftly."" Fed warns of continuing need to protect US economy German economy suffers sharpest decline on record The International Monetary Fund has predicted that global growth will fall by 4.9% this year. On Thursday, Germany reported a record quarterly decline of 10.1%, while Mexico's economy also reported a double digit contraction. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, the US economy contracted 9.5%. Exports and imports were both down more than 20% from a year ago, while consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - fell 10.7% year-on-year.

It is a drop-off in trade that is magnified across the US - a reason why the GDP numbers were so bad. ""This is now going on for months and we were told that there would be an opportunity for us to start getting back to some normalcy around this time - there's no signs of normalcy whatsoever,"" he says. ""I have a 'don't stop, won't stop' type of attitude... but it's getting to a point where I'm nervous and I've got to be honest - I'm nervous that even if I continue to go on, what's going to happen with the neighbourhood?"" The more offices that close or keep staff at home, the more the Bean Post's custom dwindles. ""I don't believe in a quick bounce-back at all,"" he says. ""This is a long time that people have not been making money. ""There are nights when there's just nobody around... There's just not enough money in people's pockets and not enough want in people's spirits."" The US has lost nearly 15 million jobs since February, despite strong hiring in May and June. The US census estimates more than half of American adults live in households that have seen incomes cut since the pandemic. Economists warned it will take years for the US to recover from the devastation. ""Even when the economy saw rapid bounce-back in May and June, the Covid-19 economic shock inflicted so much damage in earlier months that the net result was an economic catastrophe for the second quarter,"" wrote Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. Congress is debating another economic relief package but it seems unlikely to reach a deal before an emergency $600 supplement to unemployment benefits expires this week, threatening another economic shock.

Built directly on the border of Blaine, Washington and Surrey, British Columbia, the Peace Arch is a 67-foot high (20 metres) testament to the close ties between Canada and the US. Inscribed on one side are the words ""May these gates never be closed"", a reminder of the nearly 8,891 km (5,525 miles) of un-militarised border that separates the two nations. For almost 100 years, those words have been heeded - until the coronavirus pandemic effectively shut the border indefinitely. The closure came into effect on 21 March, and was agreed upon by both governments. After being extended several times over the summer, it remains in effect until 21 August - although most expect it to be extended again. ""I never thought I'd be sitting here mid-August and that border is still closed,"" says Len Saunders, a dual citizen who lives in Blaine. ""It just seems to be dragging on and on and on with no end in sight."" While the border closure has had significant economic and personal repercussions for the millions of people that live along it or have loved ones on the other side, the vast majority of Canadians want it to stay shut. Image copyright AFP via Getty Images Image caption The US-Canada border has been closed since March A July poll by Ipsos Reid found that eight in ten Canadians wanted the border to stay closed until at least the end of 2020. And as the pandemic has continued to spread across the US, so have tensions between American drivers and Canadian residents. While non-essential travel is forbidden, commercial drivers delivering goods and people who work across the border in essential services are permitted to cross. People with American licence plates have reported being harassed and having their vehicles vandalised, even if they have every right to be on the Canadian side. Mr Saunders, an immigration lawyer who has many clients who cross the border regularly in order to work, says many people are afraid. ""They're all scared of driving their cars in the lower mainland because of vandalism, dirty looks and just getting treated as some 'horrible American',"" he told the BBC. One of his clients, an architect who was allowed to practise in Canada during the shutdown, says he was told to ""go back home"" because of his car. The tensions are so high that British Columbia Premier John Horgan suggested that Canadians with out-of-province licence plates should take the bus or ride bikes instead. In the Muskoka region of Ontario, where many people have summer homes, the hostility has garnered police attention. Ontario Provincial Police say a Canadian in the town of Huntsville filed a complaint after two men allegedly accosted him over his Florida licence plate. ""Most recently this weekend, there was a gentleman up towards Huntsville getting gas in his vehicle, and two gentlemen approached him and said, 'you're American go home.' And he said, 'I'm Canadian. I live here.' And they literally said, no, we don't believe you show us your passport,"" Phil Harding, the mayor of nearby Muskoka Lakes, told CP24. ""It just becomes a little bit aggressive, and they fear for their lives a little bit."" Those caught breaking the rules can face serious consequences. In Grand Forks, British Columbia, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spent over two hours chasing a man, who allegedly had crossed illegally in a stolen vehicle on 24 July, down a river. The ""float chase"" ended where the river narrowed, when police, with the help of bystanders, were able to wade into the river and escort him back to shore. Image copyright RCMP Image caption The 'float chase' suspect Charges are pending, but anyone caught breaking the border restrictions can be fined up to C$750,000 ($566,000; £434,000) and be sentenced to six months in jail, or C$1m and three years if their actions ""cause risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm"". Those hefty fines aren't just for wilful rule-breakers. On Wednesday, police warned Americans participating in an annual float down the St Claire River near the Michigan border that even accidentally crossing into Canada could lead to a hefty fine. In 2016, during more carefree times, Canadian police congenially escorted about 1,500 floaters back to the US side after winds blew them off course. Still, the effects of the border closure on the small towns along either side are not insignificant. Before coronavirus, around 300,000 people crossed the border every day, including Canadians who routinely made daytrips to score a deal at US outlet malls or petrol stations, and American tourists exploring the wonder of Niagara Falls. Travellers to Canada Source: Canadian Border Services Agency Since March, non-commercial land border crossings to Canada have dropped by nearly 95%, according to the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). ""It's going to decimate everything up there,"" Mr Saunders says. But the economic impact of closing the border to travellers is nothing compared to what would happen to Canada if another wave of coronavirus forced a second shutdown, says Ambarish Chandra, a professor of economics at the University of Toronto. ""This travel does have a lot of economic impact on the communities where travellers go to,"" he says. ""But given the pandemic in the US, and the number of cases there, it makes sense to restrict travel to the US - potentially indefinitely."" Prof Chandra says government should provide aid to border towns whose economy relies heavily on foreign tourism, but hold steady with the border closures until the pandemic is over. ""In the long run it's way cheaper to bail out all of Niagara Falls, Ontario, than to close down Toronto for even another three or four weeks,"" he says. After months of shuttering most businesses, Canada's coronavirus cases are dropping and the country is in the middle of re-opening its economy. Daily cases have dropped from a high of 2,760 on 3 May to a few hundred. US v other countries... did it mess up its reopening? Restaurants and shops have been open for at least a few weeks in most major cities, and so far, cases are still trending downwards. Meanwhile, the US is trying to tame its outbreak, which reached a peak of 75,821 on 17 July and is seeing about 40,000 new cases a day. Coronavirus: US vs Canada Total cases and deaths, per 10,000 population Source: Johns Hopkins University Those numbers are what's fuelling the unease many Canadians have with American travellers. ""Montana is directly south of us, is having a second spike of cases right now, and I don't feel sorry for anybody that gets stopped at the border, let's put it that way,"" says Jim Willett, the mayor of Coutts, Alberta. ""I'm afraid if we opened up the border too soon, we might have more of a problem like what's going on down south."" His town is one of the five border towns where US residents travelling to Alaska can enter Canada, since the CBSA cracked down on the so-called ""Alaska loophole"" at the end of July. Is the pandemic getting worse in the US? Can California's economy survive the latest surge? Since Alaska shares no borders with other US states, Americans who drive there on land have to go through Canada, hence the ""loophole"". After the border closed, many have expressed concern that drivers have been exploiting the loophole to explore some of the country's most scenic places, like Vancouver Island and Banff, Jasper, and Lake Louise. In June, RCMP issued seven tickets worth $1,200 ($906, £694) each to Americans who broke the rules by sightseeing in Alberta. ""Do not pass go. Go directly to Alaska,"" Premier Horgan said during a news conference in July. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption American tourists have been spotted in scenic spots like Banff National Park, despite the border closure Complaints about the loophole and the lack of enforcement led to the crackdown. At the end of July, the border authority announced that Alaska-bound travellers had only limited points of entry, must take the most direct route to their destination, and should display tags in their vehicle identifying them as US drivers going to the northern state. They are also limited to a ""reasonable period of stay"" in Canada, and are forbidden from visiting national parks, leisure sites and other tourist destinations, with rule-breakers facing the stiff penalties. Since the tougher rules have been enacted, Mr Willett says he's not ""too concerned"" about the traffic coming over the border. ""[We] get quite a few people through all times of the day and night. Most of them are quite co-operative,"" he says.

Built directly on the border of Blaine, Washington and Surrey, British Columbia, the Peace Arch is a 67-foot high (20 metres) testament to the close ties between Canada and the US. Inscribed on one side are the words ""May these gates never be closed"", a reminder of the nearly 8,891 km (5,525 miles) of un-militarised border that separates the two nations. For almost 100 years, those words have been heeded - until the coronavirus pandemic effectively shut the border indefinitely. The closure came into effect on 21 March, and was agreed upon by both governments. After being extended several times over the summer, it remains in effect until 21 September.

Their objection is not just about comfort, or even scepticism that they can save lives. It’s also resentment about being told what to do by authorities. Except the interviewees above were not upset about laws that have made face masks mandatory in public spaces in many countries. Instead, they were talking about seat belts. The interviewees were British drivers who admitted to not wearing their seat belts while in cars in 2008, despite it being a legal requirement in the UK to wear one in the front seat of a vehicle since 1983 and in the back seat since 1991.

Celebrities have used it to point out that abstainers have always existed. The media has pointed to it in an attempt to explain the origin of protests against a measure that could help to control the spread of the pandemic. But the introduction of seat belt laws was far less straightforward than the requirement to wear face masks. It was messy, fraught and slow. (Read more about how face masks can control the spread of Covid-19.) Early road safety campaigns pushing for the mandatory use of seat belts led to fears that they would be introduced at the expense of air bags (Credit: Alamy) But there is a lot we can learn from the introduction of seat belt laws and other public health interventions. Why, for instance, does there seem to be differences between the adoption of the rules in different countries? And why are some people prepared to challenge a health measure that will surely save lives? An uncertain start While the evidence that seat belts save lives is undeniable, there was a time when their introduction looked uncertain. Car manufacturers, insurance companies, law enforcement, politicians and drivers all had vested interests in seat belt laws. For the car manufacturers, the issue was cost. At the time they were hopeful that seat belts would become mandatory because they were much cheaper to fit than airbags – the other technology for which lobbyists were campaigning. “[If seat belts became mandatory], proponents of the airbag, which inflates upon impact in a collision to protect riders, fear the device will never achieve widespread use,” wrote the New York Times on 28 Feb 1985. As many as 65% of Americans were against seatbelts being made mandatory for reasons of comfort A single airbag in the mid-80s cost up to $800, compared to a few dollars for a seatbelt. Had the law required all cars to carry airbags, new car prices would have appreciated accordingly creating a mini-shock to the market. Motorists were most interested in comfort. One survey found that 86% of Americans recognised that seatbelts saved lives, while only 41% of those people actually used them (other surveys suggested the number was even lower in other countries). Meanwhile as many as 65% of Americans were against seatbelts being made mandatory for reasons of comfort. Insurance companies preferred airbags to seatbelts. The benefit of an airbag is that it is “passive” – it’s there ready to save your life. If an airbag was fitted, a driver had no choice whether to use it or not, reducing the injuries and deaths from accidents and therefore the companies’ payouts. The police were against having to stop motorists to enforce the law. A passive airbag would mean officers could avoid traffic stops. So the pro-seatbelt bloc faced off the pro-airbag bloc. But the debate was not usually centred on which saved more lives. The laws on seat belt use and their enforcement is still patchy across the United States (Credit: Getty Images) New York was the first US state to introduce a law requiring the use of seat belts in the front seats of cars on 1 January 1985, a couple of years after the UK, Canada, France and Germany. But the seat belt laws took years to introduce fully. In some countries, the gap between their first introduction for front-seat drivers and back-seat passengers was decades. Japan, for example, first made seat belts mandatory in the driver’s seat in 1971, but for back-seat passengers it took until 2008 to become law. The laws were also introduced in certain countries and states before others, meaning you could drive across state lines in the US, be required to wear your seat belt when you set off, but be able to take it off during your journey. And New Hampshire still does not have a law requiring adults to wear seat belts. In the US, there are three states where helmets are not mandatory for motorcyclists of any age The same baffling approach applies to other public health interventions, such as the introduction of motorcycle helmet laws. In the US, there are three states (Illinois, Iowa and New Hampshire) where helmets are not mandatory for motorcyclists of any age, but they border states where all riders must wear one. The cultural context In Illinois, another state to introduce new seat belt laws in 1985, not wearing a seat belt was considered a petty offence when first introduced, punishable with a fine of up to $25 (almost £50 adjusting for inflation). The modest fine was supposed to reassure motorists that the law was not to be strictly enforced. Instead, police officers publicly announced they would issue the fine only if there were other offences worthy of pulling the motorist over. The statute even went one step further by stating that violating the seat belt law could not be considered negligence, which meant insurers would still have to pay out if a driver had injured themselves while not wearing one. And yet, four motorists who were charged under the new law tried to challenge its constitutionality in court. There was precedence: when Illinois introduced laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets in 1969, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled it an unconstitutional restriction of personal liberty – a ruling which still stands today. On this occasion, however, the court ruled against the motorists who brought the case. Although the majority of people now face masks, some still see it as an infringement of their civil liberties (Credit: Alamy) And the protests against seat belt laws did not mean that Americans as a whole ignored them, even if they did object to them on principle. Data collected by federal officials in New York suggested that 70% of front-seat motorists were adhering to the law two months later. In the UK, about 90% of front-seat motorists were observed to be following the law after a similar amount of time. When the laws in both countries were updated in the early 1990s to include back-seat adult passengers, the effect was less noticeable. In the UK, about 10% of back-seat passengers were observed with their seat belts on prior to the law change, compared to 40% after the introduction. In other countries there were fewer protests, but adherence was much lower. In the late 1980s, Serbia (then Yugoslavia) had one of the highest rates of road deaths in Europe. Like the US, the Yugoslavian seat belt law became enforceable in 1985, carried a fine equivalent to $75 (£150 adjusted for inflation) and was strictly enforced. But, Yugoslavians still rarely wore their seat belts. It is clear that the level of protesting and the number of legal challenges did not necessarily equate to adoption of the new law or regulation. Something else was going on. One observational study of 12,000 people in the region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, found that about 30% of people were wearing masks incorrectly The general practice for drivers and passengers in Yugoslavia, according to studies at the time, was to drape their belts over their shoulders without clicking them in place. While it meant they often avoided a fine, they were not wearing the belt for its intended purpose. If there was no intention on the part of the drivers to wear the belt properly then why go to court? And there was no restriction on their personal liberties if the belt could be worn incorrectly. While courts were widely used in Yugoslavia, they were used for personal benefit not to pursue political or symbolic point-scoring. In the US, the reverse was true. Challenging a fine in court would have been far more expensive than paying the modest fee, and few people were fined anyway. This is perhaps the most useful lesson from comparing seat belt laws and face mask adoption: the amount of protesting is immaterial and is probably influenced by how much people in a country respect authority and the legal process. What matters more is whether people follow the guidance and how effectively they do so. Protests against face masks have sprung up in many countries around the world despite scientific evidence to suggest wearing one can slow the spread of Covid-19 (Credit: Alamy) Many people do follow face mask guidelines, it seems. In the US, about 77% of people wear them, with slightly more in France and slightly fewer in Germany (the UK lagged behind these countries for a long time, before catching up at the end of July and now 74% of Brits wear masks in public). However, not everyone wears them correctly. One observational study of 12,000 people in the region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, found that about 30% of people were wearing masks incorrectly either exposing their nose or mouth and nose, although the paper is still to be published in an academic journal. Public health interventions, like the introduction of face masks, take time. The messaging and the legal framework that allows the laws to be enforced has to be right. But time will force people to conform. About three-quarters of front-seat motorists wear their seatbelt in modern Serbia now – much more than 35 years ago. Like with face masks, some people still don’t get it right – only 10% of back-seat passengers wear their belts correctly – but the Serbian government continues to campaign for their use. Despite the protests of a vocal minority, attitudes to face masks are changing as evidence shows that the interventions will make a difference and with time adoption will continue to increase, just as happened with seat belts. -- Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.

Their objection is not just about comfort, or even scepticism that they can save lives. It’s also resentment about being told what to do by authorities. Except the interviewees above were not upset about laws that have made face masks mandatory in public spaces in many countries. Instead, they were talking about seat belts. The interviewees were British drivers who admitted to not wearing their seat belts while in cars in 2008, despite it being a legal requirement in the UK to wear one in the front seat of a vehicle since 1983 and in the back seat since 1991. You might also like: How to convince others to follow the rules Why face shields alone are not enough The deadly numerical error behind Covid-19 The comparison between face mask and seat belt protests is a popular one. Celebrities have used it to point out that abstainers have always existed. The media has pointed to it in an attempt to explain the origin of protests against a measure that could help to control the spread of the pandemic. But the introduction of seat belt laws was far less straightforward than the requirement to wear face masks. It was messy, fraught and slow. (Read more about how face masks can control the spread of Covid-19.) Early road safety campaigns pushing for the mandatory use of seat belts led to fears that they would be introduced at the expense of air bags (Credit: Alamy) But there is a lot we can learn from the introduction of seat belt laws and other public health interventions. Why, for instance, does there seem to be differences between the adoption of the rules in different countries? And why are some people prepared to challenge a health measure that will surely save lives? An uncertain start While the evidence that seat belts save lives is undeniable, there was a time when their introduction looked uncertain. Car manufacturers, insurance companies, law enforcement, politicians and drivers all had vested interests in seat belt laws. For the car manufacturers, the issue was cost. At the time they were hopeful that seat belts would become mandatory because they were much cheaper to fit than airbags – the other technology for which lobbyists were campaigning. “[If seat belts became mandatory], proponents of the airbag, which inflates upon impact in a collision to protect riders, fear the device will never achieve widespread use,” wrote the New York Times on 28 Feb 1985. As many as 65% of Americans were against seatbelts being made mandatory for reasons of comfort A single airbag in the mid-80s cost up to $800, compared to a few dollars for a seatbelt. Had the law required all cars to carry airbags, new car prices would have appreciated accordingly creating a mini-shock to the market. Motorists were most interested in comfort. One survey found that 86% of Americans recognised that seatbelts saved lives, while only 41% of those people actually used them (other surveys suggested the number was even lower in other countries). Meanwhile as many as 65% of Americans were against seatbelts being made mandatory for reasons of comfort. Insurance companies preferred airbags to seatbelts. The benefit of an airbag is that it is “passive” – it’s there ready to save your life. If an airbag was fitted, a driver had no choice whether to use it or not, reducing the injuries and deaths from accidents and therefore the companies’ payouts. The police were against having to stop motorists to enforce the law. A passive airbag would mean officers could avoid traffic stops. So the pro-seatbelt bloc faced off the pro-airbag bloc. But the debate was not usually centred on which saved more lives. The laws on seat belt use and their enforcement is still patchy across the United States (Credit: Getty Images) New York was the first US state to introduce a law requiring the use of seat belts in the front seats of cars on 1 January 1985, a couple of years after the UK, Canada, France and Germany. But the seat belt laws took years to introduce fully. In some countries, the gap between their first introduction for front-seat drivers and back-seat passengers was decades. Japan, for example, first made seat belts mandatory in the driver’s seat in 1971, but for back-seat passengers it took until 2008 to become law. The laws were also introduced in certain countries and states before others, meaning you could drive across state lines in the US, be required to wear your seat belt when you set off, but be able to take it off during your journey. And New Hampshire still does not have a law requiring adults to wear seat belts. In the US, there are three states where helmets are not mandatory for motorcyclists of any age The same baffling approach applies to other public health interventions, such as the introduction of motorcycle helmet laws. In the US, there are three states (Illinois, Iowa and New Hampshire) where helmets are not mandatory for motorcyclists of any age, but they border states where all riders must wear one. The cultural context In Illinois, another state to introduce new seat belt laws in 1985, not wearing a seat belt was considered a petty offence when first introduced, punishable with a fine of up to $25 (almost £50 adjusting for inflation). The modest fine was supposed to reassure motorists that the law was not to be strictly enforced. Instead, police officers publicly announced they would issue the fine only if there were other offences worthy of pulling the motorist over. The statute even went one step further by stating that violating the seat belt law could not be considered negligence, which meant insurers would still have to pay out if a driver had injured themselves while not wearing one. And yet, four motorists who were charged under the new law tried to challenge its constitutionality in court. There was precedence: when Illinois introduced laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets in 1969, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled it an unconstitutional restriction of personal liberty – a ruling which still stands today. On this occasion, however, the court ruled against the motorists who brought the case. Although the majority of people now face masks, some still see it as an infringement of their civil liberties (Credit: Alamy) And the protests against seat belt laws did not mean that Americans as a whole ignored them, even if they did object to them on principle. Data collected by federal officials in New York suggested that 70% of front-seat motorists were adhering to the law two months later. In the UK, about 90% of front-seat motorists were observed to be following the law after a similar amount of time. When the laws in both countries were updated in the early 1990s to include back-seat adult passengers, the effect was less noticeable. In the UK, about 10% of back-seat passengers were observed with their seat belts on prior to the law change, compared to 40% after the introduction. In other countries there were fewer protests, but adherence was much lower. In the late 1980s, Serbia (then Yugoslavia) had one of the highest rates of road deaths in Europe. Like the US, the Yugoslavian seat belt law became enforceable in 1985, carried a fine equivalent to $75 (£150 adjusted for inflation) and was strictly enforced. But, Yugoslavians still rarely wore their seat belts. It is clear that the level of protesting and the number of legal challenges did not necessarily equate to adoption of the new law or regulation. Something else was going on. One observational study of 12,000 people in the region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, found that about 30% of people were wearing masks incorrectly The general practice for drivers and passengers in Yugoslavia, according to studies at the time, was to drape their belts over their shoulders without clicking them in place. While it meant they often avoided a fine, they were not wearing the belt for its intended purpose. If there was no intention on the part of the drivers to wear the belt properly then why go to court? And there was no restriction on their personal liberties if the belt could be worn incorrectly. While courts were widely used in Yugoslavia, they were used for personal benefit not to pursue political or symbolic point-scoring. In the US, the reverse was true. Challenging a fine in court would have been far more expensive than paying the modest fee, and few people were fined anyway. This is perhaps the most useful lesson from comparing seat belt laws and face mask adoption: the amount of protesting is immaterial and is probably influenced by how much people in a country respect authority and the legal process.

O On the London Underground, the smartest commuters know hidden tricks to get from A to B. In the walking tunnels between station platforms, for example, non-signposted routes can offer shortcuts. And if you pick certain carriages, they’ll deposit you exactly by the platform exit at your destination so you can zip ahead of the crowds. Navigating public transport during the pandemic, however, is something that even the most experienced commuter has never faced before. Getting around quickly now feels much less important than getting around safely. During the pandemic, public transport usage has plummeted. In London, buses in late August were running with just over half the number of travellers typical for this time of year, and the Tube carried only a third. But as lockdowns lift and offices reopen for many nations, many commuters are tentatively returning to trains, buses and subways. You may also like: Are face-shields effective? The benefits of a 20-second handwash ‘What I learnt in Oxford’s vaccine trial’ So, how might a savvy passenger reduce their risk? There are of course essential things you should do – wear a mask, avoid rush hours if you can, and follow physical distancing guidance in stations and onboard. Following local public health advice is the most important thing, and will reduce your risk significantly. (Read more about how a face mask can help control Covid-19.) But there are also less obvious measures that are worth knowing. Insights from transport research and passenger psychology can provide clues – as well as pointing to changes in how we will get around in the months ahead. Ventilation and airflow matters With a respiratory disease like Covid-19, the more people breathing, coughing and talking into the same air as you in a confined space, the more chance there is of being infected by the virus. If you can cycle, walk or ride a scooter outside to get to work, that’s your best option as there is more space to keep your distance from others. Cars are obviously personally safer too, provided you stick to travelling with those in your own household. But if everyone drives it will lead to a “tragedy of the commons” effect of more traffic, and greater environmental cost, so it’s difficult to recommend as a socially responsible choice. “Cars are very inefficient in using the urban infrastructure. If we all move in a car, nobody moves,” says Carlo Ratti, director of the Senseable City Lab at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The more ventilation there is in your chosen form of transport, the better (Credit: Reuters) If travelling by train, bus and subway, one factor to consider when plotting your route is how well your method of transport is ventilated, according to Nick Tyler, a transport researcher at University College London, who has modelled the way that the virus propagates through buses. “Outside, in the open air, droplets are dissipated in the air and the wind,” he explains. “Once we're inside, you get much less movement.” Designs differ, but the more windows the better. For this reason, a deep subway is more difficult to ventilate than a train or bus at the surface. According to a 2018 study by Lara Gosce at University College London, people who used the London underground regularly were more likely to suffer flu-like symptoms than those that didn’t. Generally, public transport ventilation systems are less effective than those on aeroplanes. The air in planes is recirculated through sophisticated HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters every few minutes, which should screen out most viral particles. “Aircraft ventilation gets a very bad press in many ways. It’s actually one of the best systems you can find,” says Tyler. And unlike many trains and buses, the air flow travels directly from the ceiling to the floor. This means that droplets will be pushed to the ground, away from hands and faces, more rapidly. A New York subway car, by contrast, pushes air horizontally, and uses filters with a lower performance than planes, rated seven out of a scale of 20 in terms of screening efficiency. (You can dive deeper into the technical specs of filters in this interactive guide to the ventilation system on the NYC subway, which also shows the path of viral particles through the carriage.) Silence is golden When assessing your chosen form of transport, it is worth considering how much talking goes on inside – and how loudly. Noisy environments, where people must lean in and shout to be heard, are higher risk than quieter spaces. It’s thought to be one of the reasons why nightclubs, bars or meat-packing plants have experienced high levels of contagion. So, a cacophonous train carriage with singing sports fans would therefore pose more risk than a bus of silent commuters reading their phones. This diagram, recently published by researchers in the BMJ, captures these relative risks: The risk of viral transmission varies depending on setting, occupation times, venting, and conversation levels (Credit: BMJ/Nicholas Jones et al/doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3223) Where to choose a seat It’s an often-quoted piece of New Yorker wisdom: “never get on an empty subway car”. The implication is that you don’t want to find why everyone has shunned that carriage – at best, a bad smell; at worst, you might get assaulted. That advice will still hold for many – if you are a woman travelling at night, for example – but in the pandemic, avoiding crowds of fellow travellers is prudent if you can. In addition to encouraging masks, many transport authorities have introduced signs and stickers that remind people to physically distance with their seat choice, but are there any other things to know about which seats to choose or avoid? A recent Chinese study looked at how seating proximity affected transmission risk on trains. By tracing the journeys and seating of more than 2,000 people carrying the virus on China’s high-speed train network between December 2019 and March 2020, they were able to see how the virus had moved between people. Sitting in the same row, especially adjacent, carried the highest risk in this particular setting. It seems that the backrests between rows on the train type they looked at – a high-speed Chinese intercity train – may have provided something of a barrier. People sitting on the same row on an intercity journey may also have needed to pass each other at close quarters to visit the toilet or refreshments. (Importantly, though, the researchers couldn’t rule out that transmission on rows was higher because people sitting adjacent are more likely to be family and friends, already in close contact.) By tracing more than 2,000 people carrying the virus on China’s high-speed train network, they were able to see how the virus had moved between people Longer journeys, perhaps unsurprisingly, increased the risk, even for those sitting a couple of rows away. After two hours, a distance of less than 2.5m, without a mask, was insufficient to prevent transmission, the researchers found. Somewhat reassuringly though, using the same seat previously held by a coronavirus carrier did not significantly increase risk of catching the virus. Where to stand A study on subway passenger behaviour in NYC suggests that people standing are more likely to hold on to vertical poles than other handholds, such as straps and ball-and-spring devices. Perhaps worth knowing if you want to avoid touching the most handled surfaces. Although the virus is thought to mainly be transmitted through the fine spray of aerosols and droplets we produce when we talk, breathe and cough, it can also be spread when we touch surfaces that have become contaminated with the virus and then put our fingers near our mouth or nose. The researchers behind the subway study also found that New Yorkers deciding to stand were more likely to linger closer to the doors than elsewhere in the carriage, because of proximity to the exit, partitions to lean against, and the opportunity to avoid eye contact with seated passengers. So, lingering by the doors may have mixed benefits – it may be the among the best ventilated spaces, but also the busiest. According to one study, men are more likely to stand than women (Credit: Getty Images) Intriguingly, men were more likely to stand than women as carriages get busier. Perhaps it’s old-fashioned social courtesy, or perhaps men simply prefer being on their feet. Yet if you consider the studies showing that men wash their hands less often than women, you may conclude it’s better not to share a pole with a man who is more likely to have dirty palms. (Read more about the relative risks of catching the coronavirus from touching surfaces.) Unknowns ahead While travelling regularly on public transport will involve a change in risk for individuals, at the moment it’s not clear exactly how much. There is some cause for optimism as Christina Goldbaum recently reported for the New York Times: contract-tracing in Japan, France and Austria found no links between outbreaks and public transport networks. Some mathematical models also suggest that well-ventilated public transport with common mask use is less risky than some other indoor environments such as a busy, stuffy bar. It’s possible that short transit times, ventilation and the lack of talking among individual commuters (meaning fewer droplets) all help. But more evidence is needed. What’s clear is that returning to pre-pandemic ways simply won’t work, at least for the foreseeable future. Buses in London, for example, have been capped at 30% carrying capacity, so if every bus rider returned to their office now, you’d need 2-3 times more buses running in rush hour to maintain social distancing, or people would face delays. And even when they arrived, a skyscraper worker might have to wait in a long line for the socially-distanced elevator, says Tyler. Perhaps we should see this as an opportunity to rethink travel. “During times of change it is important to allow for experimentation in cities,” says Ratti. “That ability to test something, see if it works and transform the city is something that we should preserve in the post-Covid-19 world.” So, while there are short-term ways to reduce your risk on public transport, a bigger question to ask ourselves is whether it’s time to reassess how and when we get from A to B. What will city commuting look like after a year or two of focusing on safety, not capacity or speed? It’s unknown, but for now, all we can do as travellers as hang on to something firm, and hope we arrive at a better destination. -- As an award-winning science site, BBC Future is committed to bringing you evidence-based analysis and myth-busting stories around the new coronavirus.

It’s actually one of the best systems you can find,” says Tyler. And unlike many trains and buses, the air flow travels directly from the ceiling to the floor. This means that droplets will be pushed to the ground, away from hands and faces, more rapidly. A New York subway car, by contrast, pushes air horizontally, and uses filters with a lower performance than planes, rated seven out of a scale of 20 in terms of screening efficiency. (You can dive deeper into the technical specs of filters in this interactive guide to the ventilation system on the NYC subway, which also shows the path of viral particles through the carriage.) Silence is golden When assessing your chosen form of transport, it is worth considering how much talking goes on inside – and how loudly. Noisy environments, where people must lean in and shout to be heard, are higher risk than quieter spaces. It’s thought to be one of the reasons why nightclubs, bars or meat-packing plants have experienced high levels of contagion. So, a cacophonous train carriage with singing sports fans would therefore pose more risk than a bus of silent commuters reading their phones. This diagram, recently published by researchers in the BMJ, captures these relative risks: The risk of viral transmission varies depending on setting, occupation times, venting, and conversation levels (Credit: BMJ/Nicholas Jones et al/doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3223) Where to choose a seat It’s an often-quoted piece of New Yorker wisdom: “never get on an empty subway car”. The implication is that you don’t want to find why everyone has shunned that carriage – at best, a bad smell; at worst, you might get assaulted. That advice will still hold for many – if you are a woman travelling at night, for example – but in the pandemic, avoiding crowds of fellow travellers is prudent if you can. In addition to encouraging masks, many transport authorities have introduced signs and stickers that remind people to physically distance with their seat choice, but are there any other things to know about which seats to choose or avoid? A recent Chinese study looked at how seating proximity affected transmission risk on trains. By tracing the journeys and seating of more than 2,000 people carrying the virus on China’s high-speed train network between December 2019 and March 2020, they were able to see how the virus had moved between people. Sitting in the same row, especially adjacent, carried the highest risk in this particular setting. It seems that the backrests between rows on the train type they looked at – a high-speed Chinese intercity train – may have provided something of a barrier. People sitting on the same row on an intercity journey may also have needed to pass each other at close quarters to visit the toilet or refreshments. (Importantly, though, the researchers couldn’t rule out that transmission on rows was higher because people sitting adjacent are more likely to be family and friends, already in close contact.) By tracing more than 2,000 people carrying the virus on China’s high-speed train network, they were able to see how the virus had moved between people Longer journeys, perhaps unsurprisingly, increased the risk, even for those sitting a couple of rows away. After two hours, a distance of less than 2.5m, without a mask, was insufficient to prevent transmission, the researchers found. Somewhat reassuringly though, using the same seat previously held by a coronavirus carrier did not significantly increase risk of catching the virus. Where to stand A study on subway passenger behaviour in NYC suggests that people standing are more likely to hold on to vertical poles than other handholds, such as straps and ball-and-spring devices. Perhaps worth knowing if you want to avoid touching the most handled surfaces. Although the virus is thought to mainly be transmitted through the fine spray of aerosols and droplets we produce when we talk, breathe and cough, it can also be spread when we touch surfaces that have become contaminated with the virus and then put our fingers near our mouth or nose. The researchers behind the subway study also found that New Yorkers deciding to stand were more likely to linger closer to the doors than elsewhere in the carriage, because of proximity to the exit, partitions to lean against, and the opportunity to avoid eye contact with seated passengers. So, lingering by the doors may have mixed benefits – it may be the among the best ventilated spaces, but also the busiest. According to one study, men are more likely to stand than women (Credit: Getty Images) Intriguingly, men were more likely to stand than women as carriages get busier. Perhaps it’s old-fashioned social courtesy, or perhaps men simply prefer being on their feet. Yet if you consider the studies showing that men wash their hands less often than women, you may conclude it’s better not to share a pole with a man who is more likely to have dirty palms. (Read more about the relative risks of catching the coronavirus from touching surfaces.) Unknowns ahead While travelling regularly on public transport will involve a change in risk for individuals, at the moment it’s not clear exactly how much. There is some cause for optimism as Christina Goldbaum recently reported for the New York Times: contract-tracing in Japan, France and Austria found no links between outbreaks and public transport networks. Some mathematical models also suggest that well-ventilated public transport with common mask use is less risky than some other indoor environments such as a busy, stuffy bar. It’s possible that short transit times, ventilation and the lack of talking among individual commuters (meaning fewer droplets) all help. But more evidence is needed. What’s clear is that returning to pre-pandemic ways simply won’t work, at least for the foreseeable future. Buses in London, for example, have been capped at 30% carrying capacity, so if every bus rider returned to their office now, you’d need 2-3 times more buses running in rush hour to maintain social distancing, or people would face delays. And even when they arrived, a skyscraper worker might have to wait in a long line for the socially-distanced elevator, says Tyler. Perhaps we should see this as an opportunity to rethink travel. “During times of change it is important to allow for experimentation in cities,” says Ratti. “That ability to test something, see if it works and transform the city is something that we should preserve in the post-Covid-19 world.” So, while there are short-term ways to reduce your risk on public transport, a bigger question to ask ourselves is whether it’s time to reassess how and when we get from A to B. What will city commuting look like after a year or two of focusing on safety, not capacity or speed? It’s unknown, but for now, all we can do as travellers as hang on to something firm, and hope we arrive at a better destination. -- As an award-winning science site, BBC Future is committed to bringing you evidence-based analysis and myth-busting stories around the new coronavirus.

W When it comes to heating, retiree Lucy Craig’s bungalow in north London is high tech. A self-professed gadget lover, when she refurbished eight years ago, she was keen to find the most carbon friendly methods for keeping her home warm. She settled on heat pumps. Outside her house, all that can be seen of the pump is an innocuous metal box. Inside the machine is a closed circuit of liquid that cycles in a pipe running from the box outdoors to a water tank indoors. This liquid is a refrigerant with a very low boiling temperature, so even winter air has enough energy to vaporise it. At the outdoor box, the heat pump fans air over the refrigerant, helping it to absorb heat, which it then transfers to the water tank inside the house. Craig has one of these pumps to generate hot water for an underfloor heating system and another that generates hot water that runs from the taps. On her countertop, an owl-shaped monitor on the tells her how much she is using. It’s usually good news. Heat pumps use only around a quarter of the energy needed for a traditional gas boiler and Craig is able to get the electricity needed to keep the system running from solar panels she has had installed on her roof. What makes heat pumps so efficient is the refrigerant gas inside the network of pipes. It flows through a cycle of evaporation and condensation as it absorbs heat from the air, turns to vapour and is then compressed with an electric-powered pump. This compression step helps to concentrate the energy stored in the refrigerant. When it gets inside, the refrigerant cools and condenses as it transfers its heat to the water in the inside tank. Oil and gas burners are the most carbon intensive forms of heating a home while thermal solar panels are the least (Credit: Leonardo Soares) Even in low outside temperatures, it can generate enough heat to keep Craig’s home warm and produce enough hot water for her needs. It is a highly efficient process, and is leading many to see heat pumps as the future of home heating. The energy used to heat the spaces we live and work in is one of the highest contributors to our individual carbon footprints. Globally, heat accounts for nearly half of all energy consumption and 40% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Of course, exactly how much of your own emissions come from heating your home will depend on where you live. In cooler and temperate climates, that tends to be a far bigger proportion. In the US, 38% of greenhouse gas emissions from residential housing are produced from heating and cooling rooms, while a further 15% are produced heating water. It is estimated that 19% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from warming up the places we live and work, with more than three-quarters of this coming from domestic buildings. The vast majority of houses in the UK rely on gas boilers, but the British Government has moved to phase these out in the next five years. You might also like: Why eating your leftovers helps the planet The hidden cost of your daily water use Why your house could be a gold mine There are plenty of less carbon intensive alternatives for householders to switch to, such as using electric heating, heat pumps, or even district heat networks, where a central source is used to heat water, which is then shared among nearby houses through networks of pipes. The carbon footprint of heating, however, is only one half of the story. In order to cut down on emissions quickly, as well as prepare for low energy alternatives, “our houses need to be warmer”, says Hannah Jones, a mechanical engineer at a UK-based green design consultancy called Greengauge. “If we all just add heat pumps to most houses as they are we’ll need more energy than they can provide.” This means we need to be able to trap what heat we get into our homes inside rather than allowing it to leak out. This challenge motivated Craig to participate in Muswell Hill Sustainability group, a network of carbon-friendly homeowners in north London who are trying to demonstrate how carbon savings can be made. Through the network’s thermal imaging group – “the TIGgers” – homeowners can have their property photographed using heat-sensitive cameras to reveal where they are wasting the most energy. A heat pump uses a refrigerant to extracting the heat energy found in the ground or the surrounding air (Credit: Leonardo Soares) “People are often surprised to see their roofs are bright red with heat loss,” says Craig. “It’s one way to motivate communities to decarbonise the country’s housing stock en-masse.“ Once you have found where the heat is leaking out, it is then possible to do something about it. Where to start New builds are easier to tackle. Installing cavity insulation and new double-glazing during the construction stage saves replacement costs in the future. For the majority of the people, however, the challenge is how to adapting their existing properties. Much of the housing in Europe and North America is more than 40 years old. In the US 13.5% of homes were built before 1940 while a third of the housing in the UK, Denmark and Belgium were constructed prior to 1946. In Germany, Hungary and Sweden 45-50% of the houses were built between 1946 and 1980 while in Italy, Slovakia and Romania the share of housing of that age rises to 50-60%. Despite this, huge carbon savings can still be made by retrofitting the existing housing stock, according to Jones. Making sure doors shut properly is a good first step, and that they are draught proofed, with no gaps. “Door brushes, beading and rubber seals alldo their bit,” she says. “Not everyone can afford new cavity wall insulation, but everyone can drought-proof their letterbox.” According to a report from the University of Sussex, new double-glazing (manufactured after 2002) provides one of the most significant carbon savings. If all houses got new double-glazing it could save the UK 20.3 TWh of fuel per year. Assuming the heat saved is generated from natural gas, the savings would amount to 3.76 million tonnes of CO2 per year – around 1.2% of the nation’s total annual carbon emissions. In a house with five radiators, reflectors could save £20 ($26) a year from energy bills For households that can’t afford to refit windows, there are also magnetised versions available, where a second pane can be stuck over the top superficially. They fit different size and types of window, and come at about one-fifth of the cost. Making the best of a boiler While the energy you use to heat your home makes a big difference to the carbon footprint, there are other ways of reducing emissions. Terence Jeffrey is a green energy consultant, based in Islington, London, where he advises residents how to get more heat out of their existing boiler systems. He recommends people pay attention to their radiators. “We always recommend radiator reflectors” he says. “Much of radiator heat is lost through the mounting wall, a reflector it bounces back 95% of it.” In a house with five radiators, reflectors could save £20 ($26) a year from energy bills, he estimates. More efficient still is to turn off radiators that aren’t being used. Thermostatic radiator valves can be added and used to control the heat in individual rooms. “Letting the other rooms be a little cooler is going to save carbon,” Jeffrey says. Internet connected “smart” valves allow even greater control. The human body gives off heat and even a pet can add a small amount of extra body heat that can contribute to the warmth of a building (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty Images) Turning down room temperature down by 1C can have a big cumulative effect. According to Element Energy, the UK would save 1.18 million tonnes of CO2 if everyone carried out such a decrease. Jeffrey is quick to add, however, that many of his clients are in fuel poverty, so dropping the temperature further is not always an option for those already scrimping by on the barely any heat anyway. He does recommend lowering the running boiler temperature to 60C. “A lower temperature over a longer period is better than firing it up to higher temperatures in short bursts” he says. Insulation and passive designs After draught proofing, insulation is the most important way to cut back on carbon. At its most extreme is a rigorous sustainability energy certification called “passive house”. The movement has its roots in 1970s American architecture, when the energy crisis meant homes were designed to maximise as much as possible on insulation and “solar gains” – the free heat that comes from the sun. “It was a case of necessity becoming the mother of invention,” says Julie Torres Moskovitz, who completed the first certified passive house in New York. Growing up in the 70s, she remembers colouring-in exercises about how to save energy during the crisis at school. “Energy has always been a theme for me,” she says. To achieve passive house level of energy efficiency, a home must use below 15 kilowatt hours per square meter for heat for the whole year annually – about a 10% of that used by the average home. A dog might give off 50 watts while an oven, a refrigerator and electric lights also add to the warmth inside the building “Virtually airtight” is how Moskovitz describes the requirements of a passive house. “If the standard for insulation are met, a passive house can reduce heating energy consumption of its occupants by up to 90%,” she says. A passive house needs a high level of insulation, and to eke as much use as possible from the heat available inside. External insulation on the outside of the building is one of the most effective at creating a sealed envelope and avoid “thermal bridges”, which wick heat from warm indoors to cold outdoors. But it can also be the most expensive and, thanks to its change of appearance, runs up against planning permission problems. There are easier and cheaper options – 10mm-thick insulation can be rolled on like wallpaper to internal walls. “Adding a layer roof insulation is also very easy to do,” says Jones. “A roll of mineral wool to the floor of cold loft space could make a noticeable difference.” Insulation doesn’t just trap heat from radiators – it also keeps in warmth produced by other sources too. “Each person in the house is going to be giving off 100 watts,” says Justin Bere, a sustainable architect in London. In a 100sq m (1,076 sq ft) three bedroom passive house, it should only require 1kW to heat the building even in the coldest months, he estimates. “So in a family of five you’ve already got half the warmth you need for the house.” A dog might give off another 50 watts while appliances such as an oven, a refrigerator and electric lights also add to the warmth inside the building. A passive house aims to retain as much warmth as possible from the sun during the colder months so little additional heating is needed (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty Images) Bere’s point is that if the house can be fitted to hold onto the warmth inside, there is less need for more from carbon-emitting sources. While many new builds are being fitted to passive house standards, existing buildings can also be retrofitted with insulation. Bere often uses insulation panels that are as thick as a mattress and are attached to wooden board. These can be drilled on the interior of existing walls. “It means the rooms come in by 10cm (4in) on every side,” he says. “However, most people barely notice the difference in the end, and the added comfort is far more valuable than a few centimetres of wall.” Jones cautions that making a building too airtight can cause problems when it comes to ventilation. “You really don’t want to encourage mould growth, or create poor air quality,” she says. Installing a mechanical vent that circulates fresh air, while recovering the heat can help here. Accidental emissions While adding insulation and other measures to make your home more energy efficient might seem to make sense, there is a risk that the carbon footprint of the construction materials themselves could cancel out any savings made. “It can sometimes be a zero sum game,” says Ahmed Khan, a professor of sustainable architecture in Belgium. Through research at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, he found some of the most energy-efficient products, such as brand new insulation materials and triple glazing, can be more carbon heavy over their lifetime due to the energy needed to manufacture and transport the materials. This is called embodied energy. Rather than fibreglass insulation, cellulose fibres, mineral wool from mineral waste, cork and even wasted blue jean fabric can be used There is a sweet spot though. “It’s possible to achieve a very high energy efficiency and low embodied energy, so long as you pay attention to the sources of materials,” says André Stephan, expert in energy efficiency at the Univerité Catholique de Louvain. Favouring materials that come from natural sources, repurposed waste or reused materials can help. “It truly depends on the location of your home, but as a general rule materials which are bio-based and not fired at very high temperatures are typically less energy intensive,” says Stephan. Less energy intensive means less greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than fibreglass insulation, cellulose fibres, mineral wool from mineral waste, cork and even wasted blue jean fabric can be used. “Reaching passive house standards or equivalent with these materials is ideal for a low carbon footprint across the life cycle of the property,” says Stephan. Smart heating In the remains of a coal mine in east Belgium is a laboratory which is experimenting on another potential solution for keeping carbon emissions down. This is the EnergyVille complex where Chris Caerts researches “smart” fixes to improve energy efficiency. He’s often asked, is intelligent technology the answer to emitting less carbon? “Compared to having a boiler switched on all the time, a remote app which turns it off when it is not needed will appear revolutionary,” he says. “But a well-programmed ‘dumb’ thermostat could achieve near the same savings.” Manufacturing and transporting energy saving materials also produces carbon emissions that needs to be taken into account (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty Images) “We need systems that work automatically and learn how to make the most of changeable energy such as wind and solar.” That might mean a hot water system that activates when it receives a strong signal from the solar panels, or even knows when to expect one. In theory, an intelligent heating system should be able to make similar decisions on a daily basis, with information from regional wind and solar farms. Consumption could be timed when there is the greenest energy mix forecast. For those with gas boilers, a smart thermostat which learns which rooms you use and when could also help to reduce your carbon footprint some, says Caerts. While truly intelligent, flexible systems that adapt to the energy mix might still be some years away, a change in mentality can start now. The National Grid, for example, launched an app earlier this year which allows users to work out when the greenest time to use electricity is. One website even offered those taking up baking during the pandemic lockdown to decide the best time to crank up their ovens in order to have the least environmental impact. “We need to be thinking about how we can steer consumption to maximally coincide with times in the day when the carbon intensity is the lowest,” adds Caerts. With many of us likely to be spending more time in our homes this winter, it could make a big difference. -- Smart Guide to Climate Change For most BBC Future readers, the question of whether climate change is happening is no longer something that needs to be asked.

That's because of a refugee who built up an empire, and became known as the Donut King, only to lose it all. Ted Ngoy was a high school student in Phnom Penh when he first set eyes on Suganthini Khoeun, the daughter of a high-ranking government official. ""She was so beautiful,"" he remembers. ""You can't find any prettier woman besides her."" All the boys at his school were in love with her, and as a poor half-Chinese boy from a village near the Thai border he had no chance. ""She was powerful, like your royal princess,"" says Ted. And she was heavily chaperoned. But then Ted discovered that the tiny room where he lodged, on the fourth floor of a walk-up apartment block, overlooked Suganthini's villa. And he saw an opportunity. Every evening, he sat by his open window and played the flute. On hearing the music float across the quiet city, Suganthini's mother remarked that whoever was playing must be in love. One night, he saw Suganthini on her balcony, and decided it was time to make his move. He wrote a note, telling her that he lived in the building opposite and was the flute player. He wrapped the note around a stone, and threw it down. His gesture went unreciprocated for days. But then one of Suganthini's servants appeared at his door with a reply. ""The note said, 'I appreciate you blowing the flute. It's so amazing, so touching.' And then we started communicating, bringing back and forth the messages,"" Ted says. ""What happens if I decide to jump into your room?"" Ted wrote one day. Suganthini replied, ""Well be careful, if you don't jump into my room, you'll jump into my mum's room."" She thought Ted was joking, but he was serious. Despite the villa's armed security guards and guard dogs, one rainy night Ted climbed up a coconut tree and over the barbed wire and made his way in through a bathroom window. He took a chance and opened a bedroom door - and there was Suganthini, fast asleep. He woke her up and she was about to scream for help, when she realised it was her classmate. ""What are you doing here?"" she asked. ""Well, it is because I've fallen in love with you,"" Ted replied. ""But what shall we do in the morning? I have to go to school."" ""Don't worry, I will hide under your bed,"" said Ted. And that's what he did. Suganthini smuggled him food at night, and after many days she said she loved him too. They made a blood pact, promising to be forever faithful. He says he hid in her room for 45 days until he was discovered. Listen to Ted Ngoy on Outlook on the BBC World Service (produced by Maryam Maruf) Download the podcast for more extraordinary stories Ted's story is told in a new documentary, The Donut King Suganthini's family insisted Ted break it off by telling her he didn't love her. He did as he was told, but then pulled out a knife and stabbed himself, declaring he would rather die than live without her. While he was recovering in hospital, Suganthini also made an attempt on her life. Faced with such determination, her family allowed the young lovers to be together. ""It's a crazy story, but it's true,"" says Ted, now 78. ""I had true love for her."" But he admits he was also aware that conquering Suganthini's heart held out the promise of a better life. They married and started a family, and life was good until civil war broke out in 1970, between the government and the communist Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot. Ted, who spoke four languages, was offered a post as liaison officer in Thailand by Suganthini's brother-in-law, Gen Sak Sutsakhan. Instantly acquiring the rank of Major, Ted and his young family moved to Bangkok, and every month he travelled back to Cambodia to collect the wages for his soldiers. But the situation at home was increasingly dangerous and on his last trip, in April 1975, the capital fell. Ted managed to escape on the last flight out of Phnom Penh but Suganthini's parents were left behind. She later discovered that they were among the first to be executed by the Khmer Rouge. The following month, US President Gerald Ford insisted the US should welcome 130,000 refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia, telling any critics: ""We're a country built by immigrants from all areas of the world, and we've always been a very humanitarian nation."" Ted and Suganthini sold everything they had and arrived in California on one of the first refugee flights, with their three children, an adopted nephew and two nieces. The family were housed in a hastily erected refugee camp on a marine training base, Camp Pendleton. In order to be allowed to leave the camp and find work, they needed an American sponsor, who would find them a job and somewhere to live. image copyrightTed Ngoy For weeks, they watched other families leave, until finally they, too, were sponsored by a pastor from a church in Tustin, Orange County, about 35 miles south of Los Angeles. Ted worked as the church janitor but he soon realised earning $500 a month wouldn't be enough to support his family. With the pastor's permission he went out and got two more jobs, as a sales person from 6pm to 10pm and petrol attendant from 10pm to 6am. Next to the petrol station there was a doughnut shop called DK Donuts. It smelled delicious and when he first tasted one it reminded him of something from home - a fried pastry, also circular, called nom kong. ""It made me homesick,"" says Ted. All night long Ted would watch people buying coffee and doughnuts, and he realised it was a good business. One night he asked the woman at the counter if saving $3,000 would be enough to buy a doughnut shop. She said he would be throwing his money away. Instead, she told him about a training programme run by the doughnut chain, Winchell's. Ted became their first South East Asian trainee. ""I learned to bake, to take care of payroll, cleaning, sales - everything,"" he says. One of the tricks he learned was to bake doughnuts in small batches throughout the day to keep them fresh - and because the smell of baking was the best form of advertising. When he completed his three-month training, Winchell's gave him a shop to run on Balboa Pier, a tourist spot on the Newport peninsula not far from Tustin. Suganthini became the smiling face behind the counter, even though she hardly spoke any English. Ted did a lot of the baking at night, with his youngest son, Chris, collecting a light dusting of flour as he slept beside him in the kitchen. image copyrightTed Ngoy They saved money where they could, even washing and reusing coffee stirrers - until they were reprimanded by Winchell's. When there was an overrun of pink doughnut boxes Ted bought them cut-price, and the pink boxes became his trademark. The family worked 12 to 17 hours a day, with all hands on deck. At the weekend the oldest children, Chet and Savy, then nine and eight, helped out by pouring coffee, packing doughnuts and folding boxes. During the week they went to school, where sometimes they were so hungry they stole snacks from other kids' lunchboxes. In a year Ted had saved enough to put down a deposit on a second doughnut shop, a ""mom-and-pop"" shop called Christy's. Once again Suganthini was the friendly face welcoming customers, and when she became a US citizen she took the name Christy as her own. After a year of running two shops they had saved $40,000 and Ted decided to expand. He bought a bigger doughnut shop, and offered to lease the original Christy's to a family of Cambodian refugees, who had been working in fast food outlets on low wages. He trained them and handed over the keys. Ted began to look for more doughnut shops to buy and lease to fellow refugees. ""Using money to provide for others is a feeling as powerful as any drug,"" he later wrote. image copyrightTed Ngoy Working all hours, Ted and Christy knew very little about what was happening back home in Cambodia, but what they heard was bad. They cried and prayed for the family they had left behind. Under the Khmer Rouge leadership of Pol Pot people were forced to work on communal farms, and those with money or education were tortured and killed. Over four years nearly two million Cambodians were either executed, or died of starvation, disease and overwork. In 1978 Vietnamese troops invaded and in 1979 Pol Pot was overthrown, leading to another wave of Cambodian refugees. Ted's parents and sisters fled across the border to Thailand, and Ted got a call from the US embassy there asking if he would sponsor them to live in the US. Naturally he agreed, and set his sisters up with doughnut shops. More and more relatives came forward for sponsorship. ""Some of them were cousins, uncles, nieces,"" says Ted. ""But many of them were not related, they just lived in the same village or heard of my name. I think there's nothing wrong for them to lie to the embassy because everybody needs a chance to survive. So, I just did it. As many as I could."" Over the years, Ted and Christy sponsored more than 100 families, often hosting them before setting them up with homes, loans, and doughnut shops. Ted encouraged others to do the same. ""It went like fire on the hill, so fast,"" says Ted. The Cambodians worked hard and because the whole family pitched in, they did not have to pay out any wages. It provided a path for refugees to settle and was a profitable business model. Eventually Cambodians owned so many doughnut shops in California that they dominated the market, pushing Winchell's into second place. It's something Ted feels a bit bad about. ""They're a good company and I owe them gratitude,"" Ted says. ""Cambodian people owe them a lot."" image copyrightTed Ngoy By 1985, 10 years after arriving in the US as refugees, Ted and Christy were millionaires, owning around 60 doughnut shops. Ted became known as the Donut King - or Uncle Ted, because of the many Cambodian immigrants he'd sponsored. The couple had flash cars, bought a million-dollar mansion with a pool and an elevator, and went on holidays abroad. ""I achieved my American dream,"" Ted says. ""We were happy - until the gambling came to wreck my life. The gambling is sad, the saddest part of my life."" Ted's downfall was Las Vegas. The first few times he and Christy visited, on early family holidays, everything went well: they watched a magic show, they saw Elvis perform. But on a later trip Ted had a go on the blackjack tables, and soon he was hooked on the glamour and the adrenaline. ""Before I'd never gambled, but like all the compulsive gamblers in the world, first you throw in a couple of bucks, $10, $20. When time goes by it gets into your blood and you just cannot get it out,"" says Ted. Because he was a high roller the casinos put him up in $2,000-a-night suites and offered him VIP tickets to the best shows. He began to disappear off to Las Vegas for days, losing $5,000, $7,000 a game, and neglecting his family and his doughnut empire. ""I did not have time to take care of business, so business was going down. I did not have time to expand. That's a disaster,"" he says. Christy would search for him in the casinos, the children in tow. Ted remembers hiding from her behind the slot machines. image copyrightGetty Images Whenever Ted won, the family would rejoice with him. When he lost he would lash out, smashing doors, breaking furniture and frightening the children. Then he would return to Vegas in an attempt to win back what he had lost. ""The more you chase, the more it's gone,"" he says in a new documentary about his rise and fall, called The Donut King. ""It's a devil, it's a monster. It's a monster in me."" Christy always forgave him, but word got around that Ted could no longer be trusted. ""I became a very, very bad man and borrowed money here and there,"" he says. Some of those he borrowed from were the people he had leased doughnut shops to. When he lost their money he would just sign over the shop to them - without telling Christy, whose signature he forged. Ted did try to curb his habit. He joined Gamblers Anonymous but was back at the tables in no time. ""I cry. Everybody cry,"" he said. ""After cry, go back gambling,"" he told one interviewer. Twice he joined a Buddhist monastery. He shaved his head and spent three months barefoot in Thailand, coming back emaciated and a changed man - or so he thought. But within weeks he was back on a plane to Vegas. ""It's impossible to explain that money had nothing to do with it. I was addicted to a feeling, and money was simply the needle that delivered the toxic dose,"" he writes in his autobiography, also called The Donut King. Eventually he and Christy were left with just one doughnut shop, which they decided to sell. Their youngest son Chris drove them there to pick up the money - but it went horribly wrong. Driving back with $85,000 cash in the boot of the car, they were stopped by the police; they had fallen behind with payments, so the car showed up as stolen. All three were taken to the police station but they were too scared to mention the cash in the boot. When they were released, the cash was gone. ""It's a very very sad story,"" says Ted. In 1993 Ted and Christy moved back to Cambodia. They had lost their beautiful home and their chain of shops, but still had enough money to live comfortably. Ted now had a new passion - politics. Cambodia was having its first democratic elections since the war and he wanted to stand for office to help rebuild his country. Besides, he reasoned, as a politician he would not be able to gamble. ""If I need the vote, I cannot gamble. When people know about the bad reputation, people are not going to vote for me. So I decided to change."" At the height of his success in the US he had been an ardent Republican, and an enthusiastic fundraiser for the party. He had met Richard Nixon, the former president, and Presidents Reagan and George HW Bush. So he named his own political party the Free Development Republican Party. image copyrightGetty Images But the name was misleading. It led many voters to assume, incorrectly, that he was against Cambodia's royal family, and he didn't win a seat. He was, however, invited to become a government adviser on commerce and agriculture. Cambodia was poor and under-developed after years of war. Inspired by the economic success of Taiwan, Ted decided to lobby the US for ""most favoured nation"" status, which would open the door to foreign investment. ""I spent about $100,000 of my own money, my time, my everything,"" he says. He lobbied his contacts in the Republican inner circle, including Senator John McCain, and MFN status was granted permanently in 1996. While Ted was immersed in Cambodian politics, Christy flew to the US for the birth of a grandchild. But while she was gone Ted had an affair. Devastated that he had broken their pact, she filed for divorce. By 2002 Ted was broke. He had spent all his money on electioneering and on a failed attempt to introduce a new type of hybridised rice, which he believed would improve yields. Then, after falling out with a powerful political rival he feared for his life and fled to the US. He landed in LA with less than $100 in his pocket - all the money he had left. His family didn't want to see him, and nobody offered him work, not even baking doughnuts. He had lost the respect of his family and community. It was a humbling experience, and the lowest point in his life. ""Many times I try to commit suicide because I hate myself. And then I hate the gambling and then I hate that I treat Christy so badly, treat my children so badly, because of the gambling, so I hate myself,"" he says. He moved from church to church, until an elderly Cambodian woman allowed him to live on the covered porch of her mobile home. image copyrightGetty Images ""If I need to shower, I knock on the door, 'Lady can I take a shower?' And she let me in to take a shower. Then when dinner is ready, she knocks on the door and I open the door to have dinner."" On Sundays he would go to the church where her son was the pastor and join in Bible studies. Ted became deeply religious. image copyrightGetty Images Still penniless, after nearly four years of exile, Ted flew back to Cambodia. Still homeless, he moved to the coastal town of Kep, on the Gulf of Thailand. He had no way of making a living until a Chinese contact from better days asked him to help out with a real estate deal. Ted negotiated well and got a good commission. More land deals followed and he has now worked his way back to being a millionaire. He remarried and had four more children - the youngest two are still at school. Ted kept a low profile until the LA filmmaker Alice Gu got in touch a couple of years ago. A child of immigrants herself, she had become curious why Californian doughnut shops were so often run by Cambodians, and why there were so many of them. In most of America there's an average of about one doughnut shop for every 30,000 people - in LA, there's one for every 7,000 people. And of the 5,000 independent doughnut shops in California today, around 80% are still Cambodian, she says. ""This story sheds light on refugees in a positive way, about what happens when they're given an opportunity,"" she says. ""Ultimately, this is a story of a guy who came to the country with nothing, and with some hustle, and dreams, and a little luck, really made quite a charmed life for himself."" Which he then threw away. Alice found it hard to persuade Ted to return to California for filming. He had burned a lot of bridges and at the time his children hardly spoke to him. ""He was afraid of being shunned and feeling lonely - but I forced him!"" she says. In the end, filming the documentary was a healing experience for Ted. image copyrightGreenwich Entertainment Although there is still some resentment towards him in the Cambodian community, whose hard-earned cash he gambled away, he is also revered by many. He enjoyed meeting the younger generation of doughnut makers, who are innovating and inventing new flavours. He also apologised to many of those he hurt. Most importantly, the trip allowed him to mend relations with Christy, who has now remarried, and with their grown-up children. ""They forgive me fully. I told them I'm very sorry 1,000 times. Every time I met them I said, 'Sorry son, sorry my daughter, sorry Christy.' ""If you could turn the clock around, I would do that. The past I cannot change, but I learned the heavy way."" image copyrightGreenwich Entertainment image captionChristy has remarried and lives in the US He communicates with them almost every day. ""Everybody's happy to see me now, because I changed from the bad guy to the good guy."" Ted now sees that the same character traits that made him take bold risks in life also made it easy for him to fall prey to gambling. ""It is the purest form of risk-taking, the distilled anxiety and thrill behind every business decision and bold declaration of love,"" he writes in his autobiography. He credits his Christian faith with finally curing his gambling addiction, although he confesses he liked to bet on football games until last year. ""That's why I want to tell the world, 'Do not gamble.' When you hook up with gambling, your life's finished. You will end up destroying the whole family and no more relationship with the world, just finished. Gambling is a devil."" But in the end, he says, he beat it. ""I never back down. Never give up. Never surrender. Even in gambling. It took longer than 40 years. But I still win. At the end, I win.""

T The twin smokestacks of the Moss Landing Power Plant tower over Monterey Bay. Visible for miles along this picturesque stretch of the north Californian coast, the 500-foot-tall (150m) pillars crown what was once California's largest electric power station – a behemoth natural gas-fired generator. Today, as California steadily moves to decarbonise its economy, those stacks are idle and the plant is largely mothballed. Instead, the site is about to begin a new life as the world's largest battery, storing excess energy when solar panels and wind farms are producing electricity and feeding it back into the grid when they're not. Inside a cavernous turbine building, a 300-megawatt lithium-ion battery is currently being readied for operation, with another 100-megawatt battery to come online in 2021. These aren't the only super-sized batteries that will soon be operating at the Moss Landing plant. An additional 182.5 megawatts produced by 256 Tesla megapack batteries are scheduled to begin feeding into California's electric grid in mid-2021, with plans to eventually add enough capacity at the site to power every home in nearby San Francisco for six hours, according to the Bay Area utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, which will own and operate the system. Elsewhere in California, a 250-megawatt storage project went online this year in San Diego, construction has begun on a 150-megawatt system near San Francisco, a 100-megawatt battery project is nearing completion in Long Beach, and a number of others are in various stages of development around the state. California is currently the global leader in the effort to balance the intermittency of renewable energy in electric grids with utility-scale batteries, but the rest of the world is rapidly following suit. Recently announced plans range from a 409-megawatt system in South Florida, to a 320-megawatt plant near London in the UK, to a 200-megawatt facility in Lithuania and a 112-megawatt unit in Chile. Currently the world's largest battery facility is southern Australia's Hornsdale Power Reserve (Credit: Alamy) Driven by steeply falling prices and technological progress that allows batteries to store ever-larger amounts of energy, grid-scale systems are seeing record growth. Many of the gains are spillovers from the auto industry's race to build smaller, cheaper, and more powerful lithium-ion batteries for electric cars. In the US, state clean-energy mandates, along with tax incentives for storage systems that are paired with solar installations, are also playing an important role. The mass deployment of storage could overcome one of the biggest obstacles to renewable energy – its cycling between oversupply when the sun shines or the wind blows, and shortage when the Sun sets or the wind drops. By smoothing imbalances between supply and demand, proponents say, batteries can replace fossil fuel ""peaker"" plants that kick in for a few hours a day when energy demands soar. As such, widespread energy storage could be key to expanding the reach of renewables and speeding the transition to a carbon-free power grid. ""Energy storage is actually the true bridge to a clean-energy future,"" says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. You might also like: The new 'gold rush' for green lithium The world's most unlikely solar farms The electric plane leading a revolution How quickly that future arrives depends in large part on how rapidly costs continue to fall. Already the price tag for utility-scale battery storage in the US has plummeted, dropping nearly 70% between 2015 and 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This sharp price drop has followed advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry to significantly improve performance. Battery capacity has expanded too, with facilities able to store and discharge energy over ever-longer periods of time. Market competition and rising battery production also play a major role; a projection by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory sees mid-range costs for lithium-ion batteries falling an additional 45% between 2018 and 2030. ""We're almost entirely piggybacking on the growth of lithium-ion battery technology, which is driven mostly by electric vehicles and consumer electronics,"" says Ray Hohenstein, market applications director for Fluence, an energy storage technology provider with projects totalling nearly 1 gigawatt (1,000 megawatts) set to come online in California within a year. The money put into research for those applications is driving down costs across the board, says Hohenstein. ""It's just like what we saw with solar panels."" In California, falling battery prices, coupled with the state's aggressive push toward a carbon-free electrical grid by 2045, have led to a packed pipeline of storage projects. A 2013 bill set a target of 1.325 gigawatts of storage to be commissioned for the state's grid by 2020. With 1.5 gigawatts of projects now approved – including more than 500 megawatts installed so far – that goal has already been surpassed, according to the California Public Utilities Commission. Utility-scale battery storage is the solution to the volatility of renewable power – so power from solar isn't restricted to daylight hours (Credit: Getty Images) When the gigantic Moss Landing project becomes fully operational in mid-2021, it will more than double the amount of energy storage in California. Several other states are also now embarking on major energy storage projects. Among them: New York's 316-megawatt Ravenswood project will be able to power more than 250,000 homes for up to eight hours, replacing two natural gas peaker plants in the New York City borough of Queens. And the 409-megawatt Manatee system planned for South Florida will be charged by an adjacent solar plant. The facility, which utility Florida Power and Light says will be the world's largest solar-powered battery system, replaces two aging natural-gas-fired units. As a whole, the US's utility-scale battery power is set to grow from 1.2 gigawatts in 2020 to nearly 7.5 gigawatts in 2025, according to Wood MacKenzie, a natural resources research and consulting firm. Kelly Speakes-Backman, chief executive of the US Energy Storage Association, says that battery storage additions doubled in 2020, and would likely have tripled had it not been for construction slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Europe has been slower to get on board with storage. ""In general, Europe is a bit more conservative"" when it comes to such developments, says Daniele Gatti, analyst for IDTechEx, a UK-based market research firm specialising in emerging technology. Energy storage development in Europe has been hindered by a restrictive electricity market dominated by government auctions that tend to undervalue storage, she says. Still, some big-battery projects are now taking shape, including the 320-megawatt Gateway system to be built at a new port facility near London. An artist's impression of what is set to become the UK's largest battery storage facility, with 320 megawatt capacity (Credit: InterGen) Globally, Gatti projects rapid growth in energy storage, reaching 1.2 terawatts (1,200 gigawatts) in the next decade. Key players include Australia, which in 2017 became the first nation to install major battery storage on its grid with the 100-megawatt Hornsdale Power Reserve, and is now planning to add another 300 megawatts near Victoria. The new system will dispatch electricity between states on an as-needed basis, maximising the efficiency of existing transmission infrastructure and reducing the need for building new power lines that would sit idle most of the time. A similar projects are gearing up in Baden-Württemberg, south-west Germany. And while the US's Moss Landing is set to be the world's largest battery, it may be so for long. Saudi Arabia has just announced a bid for that title, with a massive solar-plus-storage system on the country's west coast. The facility will provide 100% renewable energy around the clock to a resort complex of 50 hotels and 1,300 homes being built along the Red Sea. With a recent report concluding that most fossil fuel power plants in the US will reach the end of their working life by 2035, experts say that the time for rapid growth in industrial-scale energy storage is at hand. Yiyi Zhou, a renewable power systems specialist at Bloomberg NEF, says that renewables combined with battery storage are already an economically viable alternative to building new gas peaker plants. Pairing electricity generation with storage works especially well with solar energy, which generally follows a predictable daily pattern. And, says Zhou, as more solar energy enters the grid, the cost of operating gas plants actually goes up. ""That's mainly because [gas plants] are forced to cycle on and off much more now because of solar penetration,"" Zhou says. ""This adds wear-and-tear, and shortens their lifetime."" The price of lithium-ion batteries has plummeted in recent years, and is predicted to fall further, making even larger batteries more viable (Credit: Alamy) Batteries are even beginning to reach a size – around 200 megawatts – that enables renewables to replace small- to medium-sized natural gas generators, says Fluence's Hohenstein. ""Now we're able to truly build these hybrid resources – solar, storage, wind – and do the job that was traditionally done by fossil fuel power plants,"" says Hohenstein, whose company is seeing a surge of interest in large projects. Adding storage also makes renewable energy more profitable, says Wesley Cole, an energy analyst with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ""One of the challenges of renewable energy is the more you put on the grid, the more the value declines,"" Cole says. Storage helps deal with that by soaking up excess energy that would have been lost in the middle of the day, when electricity demand is lower, and moving it to a time when it is more valuable. While energy storage is thriving in high-value markets, such as California, battery prices still need to come down more to reach large-scale global deployment. Yet analysts are optimistic that battery prices will eventually drop low enough for widespread energy storage use. ""We see storage being a large player across effectively every future we look at,"" says Cole. ""And not just one or two gigawatts… but tens to hundreds of gigawatts."" -- This article was originally published by Yale e360, and is republished with permission – read the original story here.

Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on FacebookShare on Linkedin Bookmark this article (Image credit: Getty Images) By Zaria Gorvett3rd February 2021 There's no evidence that any of the current Covid-19 vaccines can completely stop people from being infected – and this has implications for our prospects of achieving herd immunity. I It was 17 June 2009. An 11-year-old boy returned to the US from the UK – and inadvertently brought something with him. Later that week, while attending a religious education programme in Sullivan County, New York, he developed a mysterious swelling of his salivary glands. He had mumps, a respiratory infection spread by contact with droplets in the air. Meanwhile, the religious course continued. The 400 children in attendance spent hours each day engaging in prolonged face-to-face contact – specifically, a kind of Orthodox Jewish education involving facing a study partner, a chavrusa, across a narrow table, while analysing and debating text from the Talmud. By the time the programme ended, 22 others had been infected, along with three adults. As the students went back to their homes, the virus spread to Brooklyn and Rockland County, then on to Ocean County and Orange County. In all, the outbreak lasted a year, and at least 3,502 people developed the disease. When scientists analysed what had happened, they suggested that the chavrusa style of learning might have allowed for ""particularly efficient transmission of mumps virus"". What might seem most surprising in this case is that the accidental super-spreader had received a full course of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. It's likely that he did have some immunity – like the other vaccinated children, he developed relatively mild symptoms with no complications – but he was still able to carry the virus and transmit it to others. In fact, most vaccines don't fully protect against infection, even if they can block symptoms from appearing. As a result, vaccinated people can unknowingly carry and spread pathogens. Occasionally, they can even start epidemics. ""Effective"" or ""sterilising"" immunity There are two main types of immunity you can achieve with vaccines. One is so-called ""effective"" immunity, which can prevent a pathogen from causing serious disease, but can't stop it from entering the body or making more copies of itself. The other is ""sterilising immunity"", which can thwart infections entirely, and even prevent asymptomatic cases. The latter is the aspiration of all vaccine research, but surprisingly rarely achieved. Occasionally, vaccinated people will inadvertently cause an outbreak of the Victorian-era illness mumps (Credit: Alamy) Take meningitis as an example. For the kind caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis, there are many vaccines available for the tens of different strains. The three given in the US – MCV4, MPSV4 and MenB – can together prevent 85-90% of disease cases. However, several have been shown to still allow people to ""carry"" the bacteria involved. They can hide out in the nose or the back of the throat, from where they are able to infect others via sneezing, coughing, kissing, or sharing cigarettes or utensils. In one study of university students in the United Kingdom, the vaccine had no effect on the proportion of people harbouring the pathogen four weeks later. ""Two meningitis vaccines can have two very different effects on whether you can spread the disease,"" says Keith Neal, professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham. ""But only a minority of those people who get the germ go down with meningitis [in well-vaccinated communities] because they have immunity to it."" You might also like: How effective is a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccines? What we know about the new Covid-19 variants How Covid-19 might evolve in the future How Covid-19 is changing the flu It's also possible to be infected with pertussis, hepatitis B, mumps, and (often, but not always) influenza, regardless of whether you have been vaccinated – though all these immunisations are highly effective at preventing people from developing serious symptoms or needing to be hospitalised. How sterilising immunity works While effective immunity is usually provided by a combination of white blood cells – such as B and T cells – along with antibodies, sterilising immunity is typically all about the latter. In particular, it relies on neutralising antibodies, which defend the body from pathogens by sticking to their outer surface and preventing them from interacting with their intended targets, such as the cells that line the nose, throat or lungs. In the case of Covid-19, neutralising antibodies that recognise the virus bind to the spike protein on its surface, which it uses to enter cells. To achieve sterilising immunity, vaccines must stimulate enough of these antibodies to catch any virus particles entering the body and immediately disarm them. What type of immunity do the Covid-19 vaccines provide? ""In a nutshell we don't know, because they’re too new,"" says Neal. So far, the available Covid-19 vaccines have not been judged primarily on their ability to prevent transmission – though this is now being evaluated as a secondary endpoint for many of them. Instead, their efficacy was assessed by whether they could prevent symptoms from developing. ""This means that we set our targets kind of pragmatically,"" says Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London. Israel had already vaccinated more than half of its citizens by the end of January, making it a useful place to study how the vaccines affect transmission (Credit: Getty Images) Scientists already know that the antibodies people develop after natural infections with Covid-19 don't always prevent them from being reinfected. One study of British healthcare workers found that people who had antibodies already when the study began – presumably from a first infection – had a 17% chance of catching it a second time. Around 66% of these cases were asymptomatic, but it's thought that you don't need to have symptoms to be at risk of passing the virus on to others. ""For a virus like this, I almost think that's asking too much of a vaccine,"" says Altmann. ""It's really, really hard to do."" Happily, this isn't quite the end of the story. There are some early hints that certain vaccines might be able to reduce transmission, even if they can’t eliminate it entirely. One way it might do this is by reducing the number of viral particles in people’s bodies. ""It is quite likely that if the vaccines are making people less ill, they are producing less virus, and therefore will be less infectious, but that's just a theory,"" says Neal. Sterilising immunity is also notoriously tricky to prove. Since most clinical trials didn't check whether the vaccines were preventing transmission, scientists are currently looking to see whether they are having an impact on infection rates in places where they have already been widely distributed. In the UK, you might expect that outbreaks in care homes – where vaccination efforts are being prioritised – would become less frequent, if the vaccines were having an effect. But this is problematic. ""There are two factors,"" says Neal. ""We've got lockdowns and a vaccine. So, it's actually quite difficult to separate them out. Is it the vaccine? Is it the lockdown, or more likely a combination of both?"" Here's what we know so far about the current vaccines' ability to halt transmission. (But first – to avoid confusion, information about their ability to prevent symptoms or protect people from disease has not been included.) Oxford-AstraZeneca Back in July last year, a study testing the efficacy of this vaccine in rhesus macaques – which have similar lung physiology to humans – provided some promising results. It found that while the monkeys were protected from serious illness, it did not prevent them from becoming infected with Covid-19 in the first place. Vaccinated monkeys were as likely to become infected as the unvaccinated ones, though they did have fewer viral particles in their lungs than the unvaccinated group. The authors noted that their results suggested that the vaccine might not prevent the transmission of the virus, ""however, it could significantly reduce illness"". Fast-forward to the phase III trials in humans, and the picture becomes a little more complicated. Unusually, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine didn't just involve injecting the participants with two doses of either the new vaccine or a placebo – in this case, the meningitis vaccine – and then following up to see if they had developed any symptoms several weeks later. This trial also involved the additional step of asking them to complete a nose and throat swab each week, to test for asymptomatic infections. It's possible to carry certain strains of the bacteria that causes meningitis, even after being vaccinated (Credit: Alamy) According to these results, published in January 2021, the vaccine was 59% effective at preventing infections in those who received a half dose, followed by a standard dose – a group that also happened to be younger than the average for the study overall. However, among those who received two full doses, that figure dropped to just 4%. The research did not look at whether the vaccine had any impact on the number of viral particles in the patients' lungs. The authors explained that while the reduction in the number of infections – and therefore the potential for transmission – in the half-dose group was promising, further data was needed to confirm the findings. The latest development is a new paper published in pre-print on 1 February, which revealed the results of a further month of studying the trial participants. The researchers found that the vaccine cut the number of cases with detectable virus by 67% after a single standard dose, and wrote that this shows ""the potential for a substantial reduction in transmission"". Pfizer-BioNTech There isn't yet any conclusive evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can prevent people from being infected with the coronavirus – and therefore halt its spread. But there are some early signs that it might. In early January, the chief executive of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, said animal studies found that it provided significant protection from transferring the virus, though this hasn’t been proven in humans. Then a small Israeli survey found that, out of 102 medical staff who had received two doses of the vaccine, only two had developed ""low"" amounts of antibodies. The other 98% had more antibodies than people who had been infected with Covid-19. The results were released via a press release, which quotes the head of the study speculating that these powerful immune responses were likely to prevent people from becoming carriers or spreading the disease. However, there are a number of reasons to be cautious about interpreting these results, such as the small sample size and the fact that the research was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. More recently, the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) looked at the health records of a million people in the country, and found that – a week after being fully vaccinated – just 317 people out of 715,425 tested positive for the coronavirus. Again, this was not a clinical trial – there was no unvaccinated control group, and the effect could be down to something else, such as the impact of a lockdown imposed in December. But the infection rate was considerably lower than elsewhere (0.04%, while it's estimated that 1.87% of people in England had the virus in the week ending 23 January). So far, Covid-19 vaccines have not been primarily assessed based on their ability to stop the spread of Covid-19 (Credit: Getty Images) A study by the nation’s domestic healthcare provider – Maccabi Healthcare Services – found similarly encouraging results. Out of 163,000 people given a full course of the vaccine, just 31 were infected, compared to 6,500 infections in an equivalent group of unvaccinated people. Moderna Though the Moderna trial did not look specifically at whether the vaccine can prevent transmission, participants were checked for Covid-19 infection before they received their first and second doses – meaning it was possible to compare the rates of infection in these groups. In all, 14 people tested positive after having one shot, verses 38 who had received a placebo. This suggests that the vaccine might be able to prevent two-thirds of asymptomatic cases after one shot. However, there were limitations to this provisional research – the number of people who tested positive was small, so the estimate may not be entirely accurate. It was published in a briefing submitted to the FDA, and has not yet been peer-reviewed. Novavax The vaccine hasn't yet been approved for use anywhere in the world – and like the others, it has not yet been comprehensively shown to prevent infections or transmission in humans. But back in November, some early results got scientists excited. The company revealed that it prevented the virus spreading entirely during studies in rhesus macaques, when they were given a high enough dose. These results put it in an exclusive club of vaccines that are able to prevent asymptomatic transmission completely in other primates – seen as a promising sign, because they have similar respiratory physiology to humans. Now scientists are waiting to find out if the vaccine can achieve sterilising immunity in vaccinated humans, too. Incomplete herd immunity Unfortunately, the ability of the vaccines to prevent transmission won't just have an effect on how long social distancing rules need to be followed – it will also have an impact on herd immunity. “If the vaccines don't completely stop transmission, it will increase the amount of people we need to vaccinate to truly cross the herd immunity thresholds and drive down cases to somewhere near zero,"" says Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. He explains that it's not yet clear what the herd immunity threshold is, because it hasn't been reached either through natural infection or through vaccination. As more people are vaccinated, scientists expect to see fewer people testing positive for Covid-19 in care homes (Credit: Russell Cheyne/ Reuters) Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that populations acquire when enough people are immune. The threshold needed to achieve it depends on many different factors, such as the reproduction number of the virus, or ""R"" – the number of further people infected by each carrier – which itself varies widely. Some factors that affect the latter include where in the world you live, the variant involved, and the conditions on the ground, such as lockdowns. This means that, even when scientists do know more, there will be no set threshold for herd immunity that works everywhere – but it's possible to estimate roughly what it might be. For example, one calculation suggests that for a vaccine that totally eliminates transmission, 60-72% of the population would need to have it, it order to accomplish complete herd immunity. But if the vaccine’s effectiveness were 80%, between 75 and 90% of people need to have it. This is potentially higher than the vaccination ambitions of many countries. The UK is aiming to immunise every adult by September, which equates to around 51m out 67.5m people – 75% of the population in total. That's assuming that every adult in the country is willing to be vaccinated, and healthy enough to be eligible. However, most scientists aren't expecting to eliminate the virus entirely. For the moment, the goal is to reduce its transmission as much as possible. ""Even if you vaccinate, you've still got a fairly large number of susceptible people there,” says Head. ""So, we will still see outbreaks happen. I think they would be fairly localised, but they would still cause concern and cause a burden of disease"". Some scientists argue that the emphasis on preventing transmission is a red herring, because once enough people have been vaccinated, it doesn't matter if they are still able to spread the virus – everyone will have immunity. However, it may prove crucial for those who are unable to be vaccinated, for example because they are pregnant, too young, or too unwell. Until we have an answer, perhaps we should all keep in mind the story of the 11-year-old boy with mumps – and act as though we haven't been vaccinated, even if we have.

491537,20210226,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55975052,text/html,text/html,en,"Covid: South Africa halts AstraZeneca vaccine rollout over new variant - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help BBC Account Home News Sport Reel Worklife Travel Future Culture MenuMore Search Home News Sport Reel Worklife Travel Future Culture Music TV Weather Sounds Close menu BBC News Menu Home Coronavirus Video World US & Canada UK Business Tech Science Stories Entertainment & Arts More Health In Pictures Reality Check World News TV Newsbeat Long Reads World Africa Asia Australia Europe Latin America Middle East Covid: South Africa halts AstraZeneca vaccine rollout over new variant Published 8 February Share close Share page Copy linkAbout sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyrightReuters image captionSouth Africa has recorded more than 1.4 million Covid cases South Africa has put its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant. Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa. The trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. But experts are hopeful that the vaccine will still be effective at preventing severe cases. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. The country has received one million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and was preparing to start vaccinating people. Oxford jab offers less S Africa Covid protection How worrying are the new variants? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against jumping to conclusions about the efficacy of Covid vaccines. Dr Katherine O'Brien, the WHO's director of immunisation, said it was very plausible that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would still have a meaningful impact on the South African variant, especially when it came to preventing hospitalisations and death. ""Comparing from one piece of evidence to the next really can't be done without a sort of level playing field,"" she said, referring to the evaluation of different trials in different populations and age groups. Dr O'Brien stressed that the WHO's expert panel held ""a very positive view"" of proceeding with the use of the vaccine, including in areas where variants were circulating, but that more data and information would be needed as the pandemic continued. South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said his government would wait for further advice on how best to proceed with the AstraZeneca vaccine in light of the findings. In the meantime, he said, the government would offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks. What does it mean for serious cases? The trial was carried out by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University, but has not yet been peer reviewed. The trial's chief investigator, Prof Shabir Madhi, said it showed that ""unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness"". media captionProf Barry Schoub on South Africa's decision to stop the AstraZeneca vaccine roll-out. Prof Madhi said the study had not been able to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections, as participants had an average age of 31 and so did not represent the demographic most at risk of severe symptoms from the virus. The vaccine's similarity to one produced by Johnson & Johnson, which was found in a recent study to be highly effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa, suggested it would still prevent serious illness, according to Prof Madhi. ""There's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that I address of severe disease,"" he told the BBC. Other experts were also hopeful that the vaccine remained effective at combating more serious cases. ""What we're seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses and what that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases, but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford's lead vaccine developer, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. She said developers were likely to have a modified version of the injection against the South Africa variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, later this year. Ministers in the UK have sought to reassure the public over the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the injection appeared to work well against dominant variants in the UK, while Health Minister Edward Argar said there was ""no evidence"" the vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness. Early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant, while AstraZeneca has said its vaccine provides good protection against the UK variant first identified late last year. Early results also suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. We should be careful about rushing to judgement Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way. Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator. Therefore the news about Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue. The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant. But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings. What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus. Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this. What do we know about the variant? The South Africa variant carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have found cases of the variant. Health officials say all is not lost Many South Africans have reacted with shock and disappointment at news that the 1.5 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines will not be as effective as experts had hoped against the new variant first discovered here in November. While there are now more questions than ready answers, the message from health officials is that all is not lost. They believe the vaccine may still be effective in preventing severe illness and go some way in reducing the number of people who need to be admitted into hospital for treatment. This is important in a country where some 80% of the population cannot afford private health care and rely on state hospitals - which are currently overstretched - for health care. So what's the plan now? South Africa's health minister has said they will take a steer from local scientists on how to repurpose the vaccine to get the most out of it. It has been suggested that the vaccine may be useful if given to the older population and to people with co-morbidities. In terms of managing people's concerns, the government and scientists may need to go the extra mile in reassuring citizens that there is still a plan in place and lives can and will be saved.

By The Visual and Data Journalism Team BBC News Published 2 hours ago Share close Share page Copy linkAbout sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic More than 19 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched. In a race against a faster-spreading variant of the virus, ministers have pinned their hopes of easing a third national lockdown on protecting the most vulnerable groups by spring. How is the rollout going? The UK vaccine programme has entered the second part of its first phase after everyone in the first four priority groups - those aged 70 and over, care home residents, healthcare workers and people required to shield - were offered a jab by mid-February. The rollout is now being expanded to include those aged 60 and above and those with underlying health conditions. The rest of the over-50s will follow, with the government aiming to offer everyone in priority groups five to nine a jab by 15 April. These groups account for 88% of deaths so far. More than 19.1 million people so far have had a first vaccine dose - equivalent to more than one in three adults in the UK. More than 700,000 have had a second. The number of first doses administered each day had been steadily climbing since December - reaching more than 400,000 a day mid-February. However, the current seven-day average for first doses is about 329,000 doses a day. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, acknowledged there were ""supply fluctuations"" for the vaccines and said it could take ""a few months"" for manufacturers to get into a steady routine for production. The campaign to reach as many people as quickly as possible was boosted by a shift in policy in early January - to prioritise the first dose of a vaccine, with a second dose up to 12 weeks later, a bigger gap than originally planned.

From spring, the government plans to begin vaccinating the rest of the adult population in age order, another 21 million people. People in their 40s will be next, once the current phase is completed. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Has the rollout been even across all areas? Within England and Wales, there has been some regional variation in the vaccination rollout - but everywhere except Wales and London have now jabbed 95% or more of people aged 70 or above with their first dose. Scotland has done the same. Equivalent age-related data for Northern Ireland is not yet available. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a vaccine among those aged 80 and over, while white people were the most likely. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, 85% of those aged 80 and over in the poorest areas had been given the vaccine by 11 February compared with 94% in the most affluent areas. Are the vaccines having an impact? When looking for evidence for whether the campaign is working, data for England shows coronavirus numbers are falling faster for vaccinated groups compared with unvaccinated groups. This suggests that the vaccine is starting to push numbers down, instead of as a result other factors like the lockdown. On average, deaths of over-80s fell by 55% between 6-20 February, compared with 46% for under-80s. Coronavirus hospital admissions are also falling faster for older age groups. We would expect this effect to become stronger over time - but this might take several weeks, and significant population coverage. How will we know if the vaccine is working? Where are the vaccines coming from? The UK is currently receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator. The Pfizer-BioNTech jab - the first to be given the green light in December - is being imported from Puurs, Belgium. A second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, is being made in Britain by two biotech companies: Oxford BioMedica, based in Oxford; and Cobra Biologics, based at Keele Science Park, Staffs. Another company, Wockhardt, based in Wrexham, fills the vials and packages them for use. Supplies of a third vaccine to be approved, made by US company Moderna, will come from Europe but are not expected to be available until later next month. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. A jab manufactured by US firm Novavax will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England, while another by French company Valneva will be made in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland. The third, by Belgian firm Janssen, owned by Johnson & Johnson, should also be available later this year. How will people be vaccinated? People will be vaccinated in three main ways, at: Local GP practices and community pharmacies Hospital hubs Major vaccination sites across the country The government has urged the public to ""play their part"" in supporting ""the largest vaccination programme in British history"", including helping people attend their appointments. Is there enough vaccine? The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines. Three have so far been approved for use: Oxford-AstraZeneca; Pfizer-BioNTech; and Moderna. The UK government has also announced an eighth deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants. It has placed an initial order for 50 million doses to be delivered later this year - if they are required. But there have been a number of challenges in what is called the vaccine ""supply chain"" - the logistics of how the jab gets from manufacturers to people. Getting enough supplies, checking those supplies are up to scratch and transporting vaccines according to their requirements have all thrown up difficulties.

Share using Email Share on Twitter Share on FacebookShare on Linkedin Bookmark this article (Image credit: Getty Images) By Zaria Gorvett3rd February 2021 There's no evidence that any of the current Covid-19 vaccines can completely stop people from being infected – and this has implications for our prospects of achieving herd immunity. I It was 17 June 2009. An 11-year-old boy returned to the US from the UK – and inadvertently brought something with him. Later that week, while attending a religious education programme in Sullivan County, New York, he developed a mysterious swelling of his salivary glands. He had mumps, a respiratory infection spread by contact with droplets in the air. Meanwhile, the religious course continued. The 400 children in attendance spent hours each day engaging in prolonged face-to-face contact – specifically, a kind of Orthodox Jewish education involving facing a study partner, a chavrusa, across a narrow table, while analysing and debating text from the Talmud. By the time the programme ended, 22 others had been infected, along with three adults. As the students went back to their homes, the virus spread to Brooklyn and Rockland County, then on to Ocean County and Orange County. In all, the outbreak lasted a year, and at least 3,502 people developed the disease. When scientists analysed what had happened, they suggested that the chavrusa style of learning might have allowed for ""particularly efficient transmission of mumps virus"". What might seem most surprising in this case is that the accidental super-spreader had received a full course of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. It's likely that he did have some immunity – like the other vaccinated children, he developed relatively mild symptoms with no complications – but he was still able to carry the virus and transmit it to others. In fact, most vaccines don't fully protect against infection, even if they can block symptoms from appearing. As a result, vaccinated people can unknowingly carry and spread pathogens. Occasionally, they can even start epidemics. ""Effective"" or ""sterilising"" immunity There are two main types of immunity you can achieve with vaccines. One is so-called ""effective"" immunity, which can prevent a pathogen from causing serious disease, but can't stop it from entering the body or making more copies of itself. The other is ""sterilising immunity"", which can thwart infections entirely, and even prevent asymptomatic cases. The latter is the aspiration of all vaccine research, but surprisingly rarely achieved. Occasionally, vaccinated people will inadvertently cause an outbreak of the Victorian-era illness mumps (Credit: Alamy) Take meningitis as an example. For the kind caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis, there are many vaccines available for the tens of different strains. The three given in the US – MCV4, MPSV4 and MenB – can together prevent 85-90% of disease cases. However, several have been shown to still allow people to ""carry"" the bacteria involved. They can hide out in the nose or the back of the throat, from where they are able to infect others via sneezing, coughing, kissing, or sharing cigarettes or utensils. In one study of university students in the United Kingdom, the vaccine had no effect on the proportion of people harbouring the pathogen four weeks later. ""Two meningitis vaccines can have two very different effects on whether you can spread the disease,"" says Keith Neal, professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham. ""But only a minority of those people who get the germ go down with meningitis [in well-vaccinated communities] because they have immunity to it."" You might also like: How effective is a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccines? What we know about the new Covid-19 variants How Covid-19 might evolve in the future How Covid-19 is changing the flu It's also possible to be infected with pertussis, hepatitis B, mumps, and (often, but not always) influenza, regardless of whether you have been vaccinated – though all these immunisations are highly effective at preventing people from developing serious symptoms or needing to be hospitalised. How sterilising immunity works While effective immunity is usually provided by a combination of white blood cells – such as B and T cells – along with antibodies, sterilising immunity is typically all about the latter. In particular, it relies on neutralising antibodies, which defend the body from pathogens by sticking to their outer surface and preventing them from interacting with their intended targets, such as the cells that line the nose, throat or lungs. In the case of Covid-19, neutralising antibodies that recognise the virus bind to the spike protein on its surface, which it uses to enter cells. To achieve sterilising immunity, vaccines must stimulate enough of these antibodies to catch any virus particles entering the body and immediately disarm them. What type of immunity do the Covid-19 vaccines provide? ""In a nutshell we don't know, because they’re too new,"" says Neal. So far, the available Covid-19 vaccines have not been judged primarily on their ability to prevent transmission – though this is now being evaluated as a secondary endpoint for many of them. Instead, their efficacy was assessed by whether they could prevent symptoms from developing. ""This means that we set our targets kind of pragmatically,"" says Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London. Israel had already vaccinated more than half of its citizens by the end of January, making it a useful place to study how the vaccines affect transmission (Credit: Getty Images) Scientists already know that the antibodies people develop after natural infections with Covid-19 don't always prevent them from being reinfected. One study of British healthcare workers found that people who had antibodies already when the study began – presumably from a first infection – had a 17% chance of catching it a second time. Around 66% of these cases were asymptomatic, but it's thought that you don't need to have symptoms to be at risk of passing the virus on to others. ""For a virus like this, I almost think that's asking too much of a vaccine,"" says Altmann. ""It's really, really hard to do."" Happily, this isn't quite the end of the story. There are some early hints that certain vaccines might be able to reduce transmission, even if they can’t eliminate it entirely. One way it might do this is by reducing the number of viral particles in people’s bodies. ""It is quite likely that if the vaccines are making people less ill, they are producing less virus, and therefore will be less infectious, but that's just a theory,"" says Neal. Sterilising immunity is also notoriously tricky to prove. Since most clinical trials didn't check whether the vaccines were preventing transmission, scientists are currently looking to see whether they are having an impact on infection rates in places where they have already been widely distributed. In the UK, you might expect that outbreaks in care homes – where vaccination efforts are being prioritised – would become less frequent, if the vaccines were having an effect. But this is problematic. ""There are two factors,"" says Neal. ""We've got lockdowns and a vaccine. So, it's actually quite difficult to separate them out. Is it the vaccine? Is it the lockdown, or more likely a combination of both?"" Here's what we know so far about the current vaccines' ability to halt transmission. (But first – to avoid confusion, information about their ability to prevent symptoms or protect people from disease has not been included.) Oxford-AstraZeneca Back in July last year, a study testing the efficacy of this vaccine in rhesus macaques – which have similar lung physiology to humans – provided some promising results. It found that while the monkeys were protected from serious illness, it did not prevent them from becoming infected with Covid-19 in the first place. Vaccinated monkeys were as likely to become infected as the unvaccinated ones, though they did have fewer viral particles in their lungs than the unvaccinated group. The authors noted that their results suggested that the vaccine might not prevent the transmission of the virus, ""however, it could significantly reduce illness"". Fast-forward to the phase III trials in humans, and the picture becomes a little more complicated. Unusually, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine didn't just involve injecting the participants with two doses of either the new vaccine or a placebo – in this case, the meningitis vaccine – and then following up to see if they had developed any symptoms several weeks later. This trial also involved the additional step of asking them to complete a nose and throat swab each week, to test for asymptomatic infections. It's possible to carry certain strains of the bacteria that causes meningitis, even after being vaccinated (Credit: Alamy) According to these results, published in January 2021, the vaccine was 59% effective at preventing infections in those who received a half dose, followed by a standard dose – a group that also happened to be younger than the average for the study overall. However, among those who received two full doses, that figure dropped to just 4%. The research did not look at whether the vaccine had any impact on the number of viral particles in the patients' lungs. The authors explained that while the reduction in the number of infections – and therefore the potential for transmission – in the half-dose group was promising, further data was needed to confirm the findings. The latest development is a new paper published in pre-print on 1 February, which revealed the results of a further month of studying the trial participants. The researchers found that the vaccine cut the number of cases with detectable virus by 67% after a single standard dose, and wrote that this shows ""the potential for a substantial reduction in transmission"". Pfizer-BioNTech There isn't yet any conclusive evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can prevent people from being infected with the coronavirus – and therefore halt its spread. But there are some early signs that it might. In early January, the chief executive of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, said animal studies found that it provided significant protection from transferring the virus, though this hasn’t been proven in humans. Then a small Israeli survey found that, out of 102 medical staff who had received two doses of the vaccine, only two had developed ""low"" amounts of antibodies. The other 98% had more antibodies than people who had been infected with Covid-19. The results were released via a press release, which quotes the head of the study speculating that these powerful immune responses were likely to prevent people from becoming carriers or spreading the disease. However, there are a number of reasons to be cautious about interpreting these results, such as the small sample size and the fact that the research was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. More recently, the Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) looked at the health records of a million people in the country, and found that – a week after being fully vaccinated – just 317 people out of 715,425 tested positive for the coronavirus. Again, this was not a clinical trial – there was no unvaccinated control group, and the effect could be down to something else, such as the impact of a lockdown imposed in December. But the infection rate was considerably lower than elsewhere (0.04%, while it's estimated that 1.87% of people in England had the virus in the week ending 23 January). So far, Covid-19 vaccines have not been primarily assessed based on their ability to stop the spread of Covid-19 (Credit: Getty Images) A study by the nation’s domestic healthcare provider – Maccabi Healthcare Services – found similarly encouraging results. Out of 163,000 people given a full course of the vaccine, just 31 were infected, compared to 6,500 infections in an equivalent group of unvaccinated people. Moderna Though the Moderna trial did not look specifically at whether the vaccine can prevent transmission, participants were checked for Covid-19 infection before they received their first and second doses – meaning it was possible to compare the rates of infection in these groups. In all, 14 people tested positive after having one shot, verses 38 who had received a placebo. This suggests that the vaccine might be able to prevent two-thirds of asymptomatic cases after one shot. However, there were limitations to this provisional research – the number of people who tested positive was small, so the estimate may not be entirely accurate. It was published in a briefing submitted to the FDA, and has not yet been peer-reviewed. Novavax The vaccine hasn't yet been approved for use anywhere in the world – and like the others, it has not yet been comprehensively shown to prevent infections or transmission in humans. But back in November, some early results got scientists excited. The company revealed that it prevented the virus spreading entirely during studies in rhesus macaques, when they were given a high enough dose. These results put it in an exclusive club of vaccines that are able to prevent asymptomatic transmission completely in other primates – seen as a promising sign, because they have similar respiratory physiology to humans. Now scientists are waiting to find out if the vaccine can achieve sterilising immunity in vaccinated humans, too. Incomplete herd immunity Unfortunately, the ability of the vaccines to prevent transmission won't just have an effect on how long social distancing rules need to be followed – it will also have an impact on herd immunity. “If the vaccines don't completely stop transmission, it will increase the amount of people we need to vaccinate to truly cross the herd immunity thresholds and drive down cases to somewhere near zero,"" says Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. He explains that it's not yet clear what the herd immunity threshold is, because it hasn't been reached either through natural infection or through vaccination. As more people are vaccinated, scientists expect to see fewer people testing positive for Covid-19 in care homes (Credit: Russell Cheyne/ Reuters) Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that populations acquire when enough people are immune. The threshold needed to achieve it depends on many different factors, such as the reproduction number of the virus, or ""R"" – the number of further people infected by each carrier – which itself varies widely. Some factors that affect the latter include where in the world you live, the variant involved, and the conditions on the ground, such as lockdowns. This means that, even when scientists do know more, there will be no set threshold for herd immunity that works everywhere – but it's possible to estimate roughly what it might be. For example, one calculation suggests that for a vaccine that totally eliminates transmission, 60-72% of the population would need to have it, it order to accomplish complete herd immunity. But if the vaccine’s effectiveness were 80%, between 75 and 90% of people need to have it. This is potentially higher than the vaccination ambitions of many countries. The UK is aiming to immunise every adult by September, which equates to around 51m out 67.5m people – 75% of the population in total. That's assuming that every adult in the country is willing to be vaccinated, and healthy enough to be eligible. However, most scientists aren't expecting to eliminate the virus entirely. For the moment, the goal is to reduce its transmission as much as possible. ""Even if you vaccinate, you've still got a fairly large number of susceptible people there,” says Head. ""So, we will still see outbreaks happen. I think they would be fairly localised, but they would still cause concern and cause a burden of disease"". Some scientists argue that the emphasis on preventing transmission is a red herring, because once enough people have been vaccinated, it doesn't matter if they are still able to spread the virus – everyone will have immunity. However, it may prove crucial for those who are unable to be vaccinated, for example because they are pregnant, too young, or too unwell. Until we have an answer, perhaps we should all keep in mind the story of the 11-year-old boy with mumps – and act as though we haven't been vaccinated, even if we have.

T The planet had already warmed by around 1.2C since pre-industrial times when the World Health Organization officially declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. This began a sudden and unprecedented drop in human activity, as much of the world went into lockdown and factories stopped operating, cars kept their engines off and planes were grounded. There have been many monumental changes since then, but for those of us who work as climate scientists this period has also brought some entirely new and sometimes unexpected insights. Here are three things we have learned: 1. Climate science can operate in real time The pandemic made us think on our feet about how to get around some of the difficulties of monitoring greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon dioxide in particular, in real time. When many lockdowns were beginning in March 2020, the next comprehensive Global Carbon Budget setting out the year's emissions trends was not due until the end of the year. So climate scientists set about looking for other data that might indicate how CO2 was changing. You might also like: A ‘mass experiment’ for the climate How your money can hurt the climate What ‘net-zero carbon’ really means We used information on lockdown as a mirror for global emissions. In other words, if we knew what the emissions were from various economic sectors or countries pre-pandemic, and we knew by how much activity had fallen, we could assume that their emissions had fallen by the same amount. While emissions may have dropped because airlines halted flights, the lack of air traffic may have actually caused a slight warming in temperatures (Credit: Getty Images) By May 2020, a landmark study combined government lockdown policies and activity data from around the world to predict as much as a 7% fall in CO2 emissions by the end of the year, a figure later confirmed by the Global Carbon Project. This was soon followed by research by my own team, which used Google and Apple mobility data to reflect changes in 10 different pollutants, while a third study again tracked CO2 emissions using data on fossil fuel combustion and cement production. The latest Google mobility data shows that although daily activity hasn't yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, it has recovered to some extent. This is reflected in our latest emissions estimate, which shows, following a limited bounce back after the first lockdown, a fairly steady growth in global emissions during the second half of 2020. This was followed by a second and smaller dip representing the second wave in late 2020/early 2021. Meanwhile, as the pandemic progressed, the Carbon Monitor project established methods for tracking CO2 emissions in close to real time, giving us a valuable new way to do this kind of science. 2. No dramatic effect on climate change In both the short and long term, the pandemic will have less effect on efforts to tackle climate change than many people had hoped. Looking further ahead to 2030, simple climate models have estimated that global temperatures will only be around 0.01C lower as a result of Covid-19 Despite the clear and quiet skies, research I was involved in found that lockdown actually had a slight warming effect in spring 2020: as industry ground to a halt, air pollution dropped and so did the ability of aerosols, tiny particles produced by the burning of fossil fuels, to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. The impact on global temperatures was short-lived and very small (an increase of just 0.03C), but it was still bigger than anything caused by lockdown-related changes in ozone, CO2 or aviation. Looking further ahead to 2030, simple climate models have estimated that global temperatures will only be around 0.01C lower as a result of Covid-19 than if countries followed the emissions pledges they already had in place at the height of the pandemic. These findings were later backed up by more complex model simulations. Closing down a global economy is not a practical way to clamp down on carbon emissions (Credit: Getty Images) Many of these national pledges have been updated and strengthened over the past year, but they still aren't enough to avoid dangerous climate change, and as long as emissions continue we will be eating into the remaining carbon budget. The longer we delay action, the steeper the emissions cuts will need to be. 3. This isn't a plan for climate action The temporary halt to normal life we have now seen with successive lockdowns is not only not enough to stop climate change, it is also not sustainable: like climate change, Covid-19 has hit the most vulnerable the hardest. We need to find ways to reduce emissions without the economic and social impacts of lockdowns, and find solutions that also promote health, welfare and equity. Widespread climate ambition and action by individuals, institutions and businesses is still vital, but it must be underpinned and supported by structural economic change. It’s essential that strong climate action is integrated into future investments Colleagues and I have estimated that investing just 1.2% of global GDP in economic recovery packages could mean the difference between keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C, and a future where we are facing much more severe impacts – and higher costs. Unfortunately, green investment is not being made at anything like the level needed. However, many more investments will be made over the next few months. It's essential that strong climate action is integrated into future investments. The stakes may seem high, but the potential rewards are far higher.

The first man in space became a powerful propaganda tool. I It was the smile that clinched it. The first cadre of Soviet space explorers gathered together numbered 20. Among them were Gherman Titov, still the youngest person to fly in space (aged 26), and Alexei Leonov, the first person to venture out of the safety of a capsule to conduct a spacewalk. But these pioneers still followed in the footsteps of another. The cosmonaut who would become the first man in orbit needed to be a calm and confident pilot, someone able to function on a mission no person had ever encountered without going to pieces. But there was more to this selection process than pure technical skill. Yuri Gagarin's smile, it's been said, could melt the stoniest heart, and not even those at the highest echelons of Soviet power were immune. When Sergei Korolev – the USSR's chief rocket designer – first met the cadre of pioneering cosmonauts, he spent most of that first meeting chatting to the charismatic Gagarin. Korolev would later call him his ""little eagle"". Gagarin's historic mission in Vostok 1 on 12 April 1961 lasted one hour and 48 minutes – far less than the average multiplex movie. The 5ft 2in (155cm) fighter pilot and former foundry worker – his short stature perfect for the cramped interior of the Vostok capsule, it turned out – blasted into space from the Baikonur Cosmodrome (now in Kazakhstan) with a delightfully informal quip into his earpiece: ""Let's roll!"" Less than two hours later, his re-entry capsule landed on the ground near the city of Engels in Western Russia, with Gagarin himself landing by parachute minutes later.

The pilot who stole a secret Soviet fighter jet A farmer and her granddaughter, who had seen the round capsule fall heavily to Earth, were greeted by the site of a strange, silver-suited figure. ""I told them, don't be afraid, I am a Soviet like you, who has descended from space and I must find a telephone to call Moscow!"" Gagarin later wrote in his log book. In a few short weeks, the cosmonaut's face would become one of the most recognisable in the world. *** Yuri Gagarin had become the first human to conquer space. The politburo had another mission for him – to conquer the world. The Soviet Union's leadership knew that should the maiden mission be successful, the first human in space would become a face recognised around the world. The first cosmonaut would become a weapon of soft power. Gagrin's dazzling smile helped make him one of the most recognisable people on the planet (Credit: Gamma Keystone/Getty Images) The Soviets kept quiet about Gagarin's mission until he had returned safely to Earth – and then broadcast the news far and wide via the state news agency Tass. The reports sent shockwaves around the world, not least in the US, which had been trying to beat the Russians to the first manned flight. ""About 4am, telephones began buzzing up and down the east coast of the United States as reporters demanded responses from Nasa officials to the Tass dispatch,"" Nasa wrote in a report on Gagarin’s mission. ""John A 'Shorty' Powers half-consciously replied to his first inquisitor, 'We're all asleep down here'."" One widely celebrated US newspaper headline later that day reads: ""Soviets put man in space: Spokesman says US asleep."" At this stage, Gagarin was just a name, a previously unknown Soviet air force pilot now being trumpeted as the first space explorer. On 14 April, two days after he returns to Earth, the USSR unveils the cosmonaut to the world at a giant gathering in Moscow's Red Square after a 12-mile (10km) parade through the city. Millions of Soviet citizens attend. There are crowds wherever he goes to meet him, even in the UK, which is very firmly in the US camp – Tom Ellis ""[Soviet leader] Nikita Khrushchev said before: 'It's not going to be stage-managed, this is going to be spontaneous',"" says Tom Ellis, a professor of Cold War history at the London School of Economics. ""And the gathering is spontaneous, there's this amazing footage of labourers and students all dancing together."" It's thought the celebrations to mark Gagarin's return are the biggest since the end of the war in Europe, 16 years before. Gagarin's charisma and easy smile are quickly evident. There are invitations for the first cosmonaut to visit from across the globe. ""There are crowds wherever he goes to meet him, even in the UK, which is very firmly in the US camp,"" says Ellis. ""It's very difficult for us now to understand the interest. People just wanted to get a glimpse of him."" Gagarin's humble roots are a godsend for the Soviet propaganda industry. Born to peasant farmers in a small village near the western Russian city of Smolensk, Gagarin's village was invaded by the Germans when he was only seven years old; his family are evicted from their home and have to spend the next 21 months living in a mud hut. Yuri sabotages German equipment and is lucky to survive the war, though he spends several months in a hospital. He's a gifted student – especially in engineering and maths – but is no bookish wallflower – he's equally good at sports, and works in a foundry while studying. Later, after graduating as a military pilot, he flies MiG fighter jets in the far north of Russia, near the Finnish border. Out of hundreds of applicants, he is one of the first 20 chosen as the USSR’s first batch of cosmonauts. Gagarin's achievement is remembered through statues like this one in Moscow (Credit: Joel Sagat/AFP/Getty Images) Gagarin's visit to the UK, three months after his historic flight, is initially a cautious affair. The US-aligned United Kingdom steps carefully around the politics, refusing to make it a state visit, even though Gagarin is accompanied by an official delegation. The UK authorities are perhaps taken aback by the excitement. A foundry workers' union – in honour of Gagarin's former occupation – invite the cosmonaut to Manchester, and Gagarin accepts, extending his stay. ""There's quite a famous moment when he's appearing in Manchester, and he stays in an open-top car even though it's raining, because, he says, 'The people have come to see me.'"" Gagarin's world tour comes at a delicate time in East-West relations. It is only a few months before the building of the Berlin Wall. His flight takes place only a few days before the abortive US-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba; the Cuba Missile Crisis a year later will bring the world closer to a nuclear confrontation than ever before. Amid such tension, Gagarin's visit is a rare moment of celebration, and possibly a way of building detente. ""One of the other people who was working with him said, 'That person who asks for an autograph and gets a moment with him, will come back and show all their friends and family, and start reading more about the space programme,'"" says Ellis. In the UK, Gagarin's popularity took the establishment by surprise ""When he came here to England, he was seen as a superhero,"" says Gurbir Singh, a space journalist who has written a book about Gagarin's visit to the UK. ""He had experienced something no one else had experienced. Apart from the speed and altitude records he achieved… he'd also experienced a realm – space, micro-gravity, weightlessness – something no one had ever experienced, and for a few months, no one else would experience."" In 1957, the launch of Sputnik 1 had sent a spasm of panic around Western nations, who saw it as proof of the USSR's ballistic missile arsenal. But Sputnik never survived its historic mission, Gurbir says, burning up in the atmosphere some three months later. ""Gagarin was a person, a human being, a very delightful character… he came across as a very warm and engaging individual. And that smile! Everybody I spoke to remembered that."" Gagarin's iconic presence did not die with the fall of the Soviet Union (Credit: Yuri Kadobnov/AFP/Getty Images) In the UK, Gagarin's popularity took the establishment by surprise. ""He certainly met the prime minister MacMillan and the Queen at Buckingham Palace, and neither of those two things were on the cards at the time he arranged to come. It was very confusing for the British government, to on the one hand recognise the technological achievement. And it was a huge technological achievement – and the bravery of this individual… it was a very high-risk adventure."" Gagarin, it emerged later, was lucky to survive the mission – not because of problems in space, but because his re-entry module had failed to disengage properly from the orbital module. The cables failed to cut correctly and the two craft spun violently until the wires gave way. Only after that was Gagarin able to eject from the module and make it safely back down to Earth. ""So when he did come over, everybody in the West acknowledged that this was a huge achievement for the Soviet Union."" This glorification of Gagarin's humble roots goes deeper than a simple East-vs-West battle of wills ""It put the senior politicians here in the UK in a very awkward position. One the one hand they did want to acknowledge the huge achievement for the Soviet Union, but on the other hand they didn't want to upset the allies across the Atlantic. At that time the American space programme was struggling to catch up. In the end there was a compromise, the invitation for Gagarin to visit the UK didn't come from the British government, it came from various places – including the mayor of Newcastle."" An exhibition promoting the Soviet Union, which started the day before Gagarin arrived, was another convenient peg on which to hang his visit. Though by this time Gagarin had already visited Prague in then-Czechoslovakia and the Finnish capital Helsinki, Singh says the London visit was the pinnacle because ""it was the heart of the capitalist West"". Gagarin's popularity took the British government by surprise, and audiences with the prime minister and the Queen were hastily arranged (Credit: Hoxton/Getty Images) The ever-smiling Gagarin was, Ellis says, ""a much more appealing face for communism. Gagarin is a really charismatic figure. He embodies the Soviet Union and the journey it's going through. He's had a childhood interrupted by the war… he's come from a collective farm to the stars in just 27 years. It's kind of what the Soviet Union has done, too."" When his parents attend his parade in Red Square, they are told to dress simply – further strengthening the ""carpenter to cosmonaut"" ideal the Soviet top brass wishes to present. This glorification of Gagarin's humble roots goes deeper than a simple East-vs-West battle of wills, says Ellis. The early 1960s is a period of enormous global change, with many former colonies finally gaining their independence. Ellis says the exploits of Gagarin – and wider Soviet accomplishments – are a ""model of development"" for many new nations. ""The Soviets are essentially saying to them, 'Look, we've been through the same things that you have, we were technologically backward, and we've managed to forge ahead and get to space in a short amount of time.'"" The garrulous, ever-smiling Gagarin was the easygoing public face of something more imposing – a giant technical/industrial base able to design and build a rocket to send a human into space. Gagarin's tour included a stop off at the United Nations in New York (technically he did not set foot on US soil because he was taken from the airport to the UN by helicopter) but also visited some newly independent nations, like India, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. When he died, it all started to go wrong for the Soviet Union – Tom Ellis Unlike most of his contemporary cosmonauts – such as Alexei Leonov, who passed away in 2019 aged 85 – Gagarin is frozen in time. The statues and paintings, like the young cosmonaut himself, never age. After his world tour, Gagarin became deputy director of the new Cosmonaut Training Centre. Sudden fame and the pressure of his diplomatic duties put strain on his marriage; there were rumours of a drink problem and infidelities, including one where Gagarin leapt out of a window after being caught by his wife in bed with another woman. Gagarin then focused on getting fit enough for a return to space. The first cosmonaut was reserve pilot for the first Soyuz mission in April 1967; this mission ended in tragedy, killing Gagarin's friend Vladimir Komarov. Soviet authorities banned him from space travel, though Gagarin still insisted on logging enough flight hours on jet aircraft to remain a credible instructor. It was on one of these flights, in March 1968, that Gagarin died. In an incident still mired in conspiracy and controversy, Gagarin's MiG-15 trainer crashed in woodland just outside Moscow. he was only 34. Gagarin's feat ensured that huge crowds greeted everywhere on his world tour (Credit: Daily Herald/Getty Images) ""When he died, it all started to go wrong for the Soviet Union,"" says Ellis. ""Korolev dies. You have the Americans surging ahead with the Saturn 5 rocket [which eventually takes them to the Moon]. They know they're in trouble. ""Gagarin's status survives the Soviet space programme being eclipsed by the Americans. ""He's enshrined as a hero,"" says Ellis. ""When Neil Armstrong visits the Soviet Union, he is mobbed by crowds who are really pleased to see him. Nasa thought that it's maybe because Armstrong looks a little like Gagarin.""

Six cases were detected in more than 6.8 million doses of the vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said. Johnson & Johnson has paused its EU rollout, which started this week. It follows similar cases after doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which prompted curbs to its use. The FDA said it was recommending the temporary pause ""out of an abundance of caution"". It confirmed that one patient died from blood clotting complications, and another is in a critical condition. All six cases were in women aged between 18 and 48, with symptoms appearing six to 13 days after vaccination. Following the advice, all federal sites in the US have stopped using the vaccine until further investigations into its safety are completed. State and private contractors are expected to follow suit. The US has by far the most confirmed cases of Covid-19 - more than 31 million - with more than 562,000 deaths, another world high. Blood clot is 'very rare AstraZeneca side effect' What you need to know about vaccine safety Johnson & Johnson is a US health care company, but the vaccine was developed mainly by a pharmaceutical branch in Belgium with laboratories in the Netherlands, and is also known as Janssen. Unlike some of the other jabs, it is given as a single shot and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, making it easier to distribute in hotter climates or more remote areas. While many countries have pre-ordered millions of doses, it has only been approved in a few nations. image copyrightReuters It was cleared for use in the US on 27 February, but the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been used more widely. The J&J vaccine has been administered to nearly seven million people in the US, which is around 3% of the total immunisations given so far. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's top Covid adviser, said it was too early to comment on whether it could have its authorisation revoked. South Africa, which was the first country to administer the vaccine, has also paused its use, although no cases of blood clots have been reported in the country. The jab became the preferred vaccine there after studies showed it had a higher protection rate against the South African variant than other jabs. Since mid-February, nearly 300,000 healthcare workers have received it. image copyrightReuters image captionSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa receives one of the first Johnson & Johnson vaccines in Cape Town The World Health Organization told Reuters it was monitoring the situation and waiting for reports from the US and European regulators. However deliveries of the vaccine to EU countries started just 24 hours before J&J said it would pause the European rollout. As it has not been administered in the EU yet, experts there will be looking to the United States to see what their next move is. The EU's vaccine roll-out has been criticised by the WHO for being too slow, and and there are concerns this latest delay could throw it into further turmoil. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Today’s developments with the J&J vaccine in the US are under close monitoring by @EMA_News and its pharmacovigilance bodies, with an open line to the @US_FDA and other international regulators. EU rollout has been paused by the company. Vaccine safety is always paramount. — Stella Kyriakides (@SKyriakidesEU) April 13, 2021 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is yet to be approved in the UK, although 30 million doses are on pre-order. The Department of Health said the rollout delay would not affect vaccine supplies in the UK, or derail the aim to offer a jab to all adults by the end of July. Canada has pre-ordered 10 million doses of the vaccine, and is ""still on track"" to receive the first shipment by the end of the month, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""But obviously, we're following closely the developments in the United States,"" he added. What do we know about the latest cases of blood clots? In a joint statement, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they were ""reviewing data involving six reported US cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine"". It said the clotting was called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). The statement said that this type of blood clot needed a different treatment than usual. media captionWATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna – three Covid-19 vaccines compared The common treatment - an anticoagulant drug called heparin - ""may be dangerous"", it said. Pending a further review, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution"". Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Why the vaccine alone won't rid us of Covid The joint statement said that ""people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider"". Johnson & Johnson statement Johnson & Johnson issued a statement saying that it shared ""all adverse event reports"" with the health authorities. It added: ""We are aware that thromboembolic events including those with thrombocytopenia have been reported with Covid-19 vaccines. At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine."" Cautious approach for the incredibly rare By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter The US health protection agency has identified a very small number of the same rare form of blood clots seen in people given the AstraZeneca jab. Governments around the world have cautiously begun to link these rare blood clotting incidents to the vaccine because of their unusual presentation - though this link hasn't been definitively proven. People suffering them had very low platelet counts - blood cells that normally help repair damage in the body. The Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines work in very similar ways. so in some respects it's not surprising they may cause similar side effects. And these appear to be comparably rare. The numbers we're talking about are so low that it's difficult to say confidently what the risk of fatal blood clots is, but for the AstraZeneca jab it has been estimated at one-in-a-million. There have been six cases out of 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson jab. In contrast, Covid kills one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms (and this risk is much higher among older people). Once you get into the youngest age groups, who are less likely to die from Covid, that risk calculus shifts, particularly when there aren't too many infections in circulation.

The charity had been tapped by his government last year to oversee a volunteer programme for students during the pandemic. Mr Trudeau later faced scrutiny when it was revealed he had personal ties to the organisation. But the report found former finance minister Bill Morneau had breached federal ethics rules in the scandal. Mr Morneau resigned in August, although he denied it was because of this case. A simple guide to the new crisis engulfing Trudeau Charity embroiled in Trudeau scandal to exit Canada Canada ex-finance minister cleared on charity gift Mr Morneau faced pressure to step down last summer after it was revealed WE had covered some of his expenses while he was on two trips with his family to see some of the charity's work in Kenya and Ecuador. He said it was an oversight and repaid C$41,000 ($33,000; £ 24,000). In October, federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion cleared Mr Morneau of ethical wrongdoing for that, saying it appeared to be a genuine mistake. But on Thursday, Mr Dion released a report that found Mr Morneau had placed himself in a conflict of interest ""on several occasions"" in other ways. The former finance minister's relationship with the charity, and a friendship with WE co-founder Craig Kielburger in particular, ""afforded WE unfettered access to the Office of the Minister of Finance"", Mr Dion wrote. image copyrightReuters image captionMr Morneau stepped down as finance minister last year amid criticism for his involvement with WE Charity Mr Morneau broke conflict of interest rules by ""improperly furthering WE's private interests, by failing to recuse himself from decisions relating to WE, and by giving WE preferential treatment"", the report said. In a statement, Mr Morneau reiterated that he should have recused himself from the government's discussion regarding the charity, given his personal ties. He had previously apologised for failing to do so. The former finance minister also reiterated a finding of the report - that he did not have direct involvement in the recommendation of WE Charity for the programme. What did the report say about Mr Trudeau? When it came to Mr Trudeau, the ethics commissioner acknowledged there was an ""appearance"" of a conflict of interest because of Mr Trudeau's family connection to WE but that no ethical wrongdoing had occurred. ""I am satisfied that Mr Trudeau did not give preferential treatment to WE,"" he wrote. Responding to the findings, Mr Trudeau said the commissioner had confirmed ""what I have been saying from the beginning"". ""At the heart of this initiative was getting support for youth during this pandemic as fast as possible."" What happened to the programme? WE charity had been hired by the federal government to deliver a national youth volunteer programme for students hard hit by the economic slump caused by Covid-19. But in July 2020, WE co-founders Craig and Marc Kielburger announced they were withdrawing from the programme because it had been ""enmeshed in controversy from the moment of its announcement"". The founders told members of Parliament last summer they were not tapped for the programme due to any political connections, did not gain financially, and in fact lost C$5m when the deal was dissolved. Craig Kielburger added that fallout from the matter had ""resulted in serious challenges that risk the entire organisation"". And in September, WE said it would be ""winding down the organisation's operations in Canada"". The brothers will be leaving the organisation entirely. The pair - who co-founded the charity in their parents' Ontario home when Craig was 12 years old - had achieved celebrity status in their home country, and appeared on television programmes like Oprah and 60 Minutes.

Extensive reports by the 9/11 Commission, US government agencies and expert groups have refuted the existence of any hidden conspiracy. But activist groups in the US and elsewhere, the 9/11 Truth movement, say the facts have been hidden. Some leading members of the movement have also embraced conspiracies about Covid-19 and vaccines. And some senior politicians, celebrities and media figures have also disputed the official account. 'World government' The rise of new conspiracy movements online, such as QAnon, whose followers, among other conspiratorial views, believe a US ""deep state"" responsible for the attacks, has kept these conspiracy theories in circulation and brought them to a far larger audience. And online clips from a series of films known as Loose Change have reinforced many of the falsehoods circulating. Some claim the US government staged the attacks or knew of them in advance and allowed them. And these falsehoods mesh with more recent online movements' belief global elites plan to curtail civil liberties in response to the attacks and facilitate the establishment of an authoritarian world government. image source, Getty Images image captionOnline conspiracy-theory platforms continue to push claims of US involvement in the attacks A claim widely shared online, ""Jet fuel cannot melt steel beams,"" suggests the World Trade Center's Twin Towers were demolished by explosives. But according to an official report, the crashed planes considerably damaged support columns of both the towers and dislodged fire-proofing. Additionally, the fires reached up to 1,000C in some areas, causing the steel beams to warp and the eventual collapse of the buildings. Uncontrolled fires The collapse of 7 World Trade Center, a 47-storey skyscraper in the vicinity of the Twin Towers, has attracted many conspiracy theories, some of which were trending on major social networks on last year's 9/11 anniversary. This building - containing offices of the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the Office of Emergency Management - collapsed hours after the Twin Towers without being hit by a plane or directly targeted. The evolution of 9/11 conspiracy theories image source, YOUTUBE/NIST image captionFootage of 7 World Trade Center vertically collapsing on itself is cited as evidence of a controlled demolition But in 2008, a three-year investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded it had collapsed because of intense and uncontrolled fires - lasting for nearly seven hours - started by debris from the fall of the nearby North Tower. 7 World Trade Center was the first tower of its kind to collapse because a fire. But in 2017, the Plasco tower in the Iranian capital, Tehran, became the second. Go viral The fact the collapse of 7 World Trade Center was announced in a live report by BBC News correspondent Jane Stanley - while it was still visibly standing behind her - has been cited by conspiracy theorists as evidence major media organisations were part of the inside-job plot. image caption7 World Trade Center was still standing while its collapse was erroneously reported on BBC World News The Reuters news agency had mistakenly reported the collapse of the building, which was also picked up by CNN, just before the live report. Reuters later issued a correction - but clips of the report continue go viral in the days leading up to 9/11 anniversaries. Was the BBC part of the 9/11 conspiracy? Business jet Some online conspiracy theories suggest US missiles were fired at the Pentagon, as part of a government plot, and the hole left in the building was too small to have been caused by a passenger plane. But a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers told Popular Mechanics magazine the size and shape of the hole was due to one wing of the Boeing 757 hitting the ground and the other being severed on impact with the building. image source, Getty Images image captionTheories suggest a missile, not a Boeing 757, actually hit the Pentagon Meanwhile, United Airlines Flight 93 crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers tried to take control of the plane from the hijackers. Online theories claim it was shot down by a white business jet flying into a nearby airport. But aviation officials had requested the jet inspect the area, which it did, reporting back evidence of a big hole in the ground with smoke coming out of it. image source, Reuters image captionA theory claims wreckage of United Airlines Flight 93 proves it was shot down Vice-President Dick Cheney later revealed in his autobiography that following the attack on the Twin Towers, he had ordered the shooting down of any commercial airliner believed to have been hijacked. But in the chaos and confusion that followed the attack, his order was not passed to fighter pilots, according to the 9/11 Commission report. 'Jewish elites' Another theory falsely claims no Jewish people were killed in the attacks because 4,000 Jewish employees at the World Trade Center had received advance notice not to turn up for work. Believers conclude the Israeli government mounted the attacks to goad the US into attacking its regional enemies or responsibility lies with powerful Jewish elites who control world events from the shadows. But of the 2,071 victims of 9/11 who worked at the World Trade Center, 119 were confirmed to be Jewish and at least a further 72 were believed to be Jewish. That would constitute 9.2% of the victims, according to research by BBC documentary Conspiracy Files, broadly in line with the 9.7% of New York's commuting population believed to be Jewish at the time. And some estimate up to 400 Jewish people might have died that day. Similar theories surround other states, including Iraq and Iran, but no evidence of their direct involvement has ever been found.
