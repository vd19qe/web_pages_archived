With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

Our clients and the communities that we live in need the supports that we, as members of CUPE 1287 provide every day in our jobs. Each and every one of us is stressed, worried, frustrated…and the uncertainty goes on. There have been individual emails that I have received as president, and yes I have yet to reply. If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

It can’t be said enough, Thank you. The work that you all continue to do is not going unnoticed. Our clients and the communities that we live in need the supports that we, as members of CUPE 1287 provide every day in our jobs. Each and every one of us is stressed, worried, frustrated…and the uncertainty goes on. There have been individual emails that I have received as president, and yes I have yet to reply. If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

It can’t be said enough, Thank you. The work that you all continue to do is not going unnoticed. Our clients and the communities that we live in need the supports that we, as members of CUPE 1287 provide every day in our jobs. Each and every one of us is stressed, worried, frustrated…and the uncertainty goes on. There have been individual emails that I have received as president, and yes I have yet to reply. If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk.

With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf.

I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario.

It can’t be said enough, Thank you. The work that you all continue to do is not going unnoticed. Our clients and the communities that we live in need the supports that we, as members of CUPE 1287 provide every day in our jobs. Each and every one of us is stressed, worried, frustrated…and the uncertainty goes on. There have been individual emails that I have received as president, and yes I have yet to reply. If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

It can’t be said enough, Thank you. The work that you all continue to do is not going unnoticed. Our clients and the communities that we live in need the supports that we, as members of CUPE 1287 provide every day in our jobs. Each and every one of us is stressed, worried, frustrated…and the uncertainty goes on. There have been individual emails that I have received as president, and yes I have yet to reply. If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way.

We’ve communicated as much to OMERS, asking that the June vote on a proposal to get rid of 100% inflation indexing be postponed. We will update you as soon as we hear back from OMERS. Stay safe and don’t hesitate to reach out to CUPE Ontario for any help needed.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”.

We’ve communicated as much to OMERS, asking that the June vote on a proposal to get rid of 100% inflation indexing be postponed. We will update you as soon as we hear back from OMERS. Stay safe and don’t hesitate to reach out to CUPE Ontario for any help needed.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

It can’t be said enough, Thank you. The work that you all continue to do is not going unnoticed. Our clients and the communities that we live in need the supports that we, as members of CUPE 1287 provide every day in our jobs. Each and every one of us is stressed, worried, frustrated…and the uncertainty goes on. There have been individual emails that I have received as president, and yes I have yet to reply. If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf.

I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

Each and every one of us is stressed, worried, frustrated…and the uncertainty goes on. There have been individual emails that I have received as president, and yes I have yet to reply. If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard.

With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf.

It is especially bad for younger workers Read more [...] Categories Uncategorized Important OMERS Update from CUPE Ontario, Time Sensitive June 10, 2020June 10, 2020 by cupe1287 For the 3rd time in 4 years, OMERS is trying to take away guaranteed indexing, an important benefit that protects our pensions from inflation when we retire. They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk. This proposal, if passed, will actually benefit employers by shifting risk from employers to workers and retirees.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard. It may appear and feel that nothing is being done. This is not the case. Your concerns are being forwarded and addressed. I cannot emphasize enough to all of you, to continue bringing your concerns and suggestions to your supervisors/managers, your union executive, stewards and Joint Occupational Health & Safety representatives. With all our bargaining units that we represent, 1st VP Brandie, 2nd VP Kevin and I will continue to be your voice to all employers in CUPE 1287, on every members’ behalf. Not all CUPE 1287 employers have it, but if yours does, make sure to access the services of your Employee Family Assistance Programs (EFAP). I would encourage everyone to be accessing information updates that are posted on our CUPE National website: https://cupe.ca/. You can subscribe for the updates or regularly access. CUPE National deals with the Federal Government on National issues. The Q & A on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) https://cupe.ca/canada-emergency-response-benefit-qa is another example of helpful information. (March 25, 2020). As well CUPE Ontario at https://cupe.on.ca/ . They deal with issues on the Provincial Government level. The Region’s Website https://www.niagararegion.ca/ is also a good resource for information; how to contact public health, information fact sheets on COVID-19 from Niagara Regional Health as well as links to Public Health Ontario. Again… stay informed, stay safe and stay well. Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY. DIGNITY.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated. It is especially bad for younger workers Read more [...] Categories Uncategorized Important OMERS Update from CUPE Ontario, Time Sensitive June 10, 2020June 10, 2020 by cupe1287 For the 3rd time in 4 years, OMERS is trying to take away guaranteed indexing, an important benefit that protects our pensions from inflation when we retire. They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk. This proposal, if passed, will actually benefit employers by shifting risk from employers to workers and retirees.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

The “Shared Risk indexing” proposal passed. This means that for service worked after December 31, 2022, annual indexing for that portion of your OMERS pension could be reduced or even eliminated. It is especially bad for younger workers Read more [...] Categories Uncategorized Important OMERS Update from CUPE Ontario, Time Sensitive June 10, 2020June 10, 2020 by cupe1287 For the 3rd time in 4 years, OMERS is trying to take away guaranteed indexing, an important benefit that protects our pensions from inflation when we retire. They cynically call their proposal to cut guaranteed indexing “Shared Risk Indexing” but fail to mention it is only workers and retirees, like us, sharing the risk.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful. From our National CUPE website: https://cupe.ca/cupe-backgrounder-federal-income-support-announcements and Q & A on these Income supports https://cupe.ca/income-supports-workers-during-coronavirus-pandemic Niagara Region Public Health website with informational links and how to contact the nurses at the Covid-19 Info Line, including Self-Assessment: https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/covid-19/default.aspx?topic=1 Ontario Government Tele Health and link to their online Self-Assessment : https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-medical-advice-telehealth-ontario Sharon Mills, President CUPE 1287 C: 289-686-7582 E: president@cupe1287.com EQUALITY.

A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”. On a personal note, please remember to take care of yourselves. To continue to take care of our families, our work, we need to make time for ‘us’. It may only be a moment, but sliver out that personal time. Be it your faith, your own mindfulness following, a workout regime, quiet time with a book, listening to music, make sure to take that moment for yourselves. It always proves surprising to me, what energy and strength I get from my personal ‘faith’ moment. Please continue to follow the guidelines of social distancing, handwashing in our work lives and in our home lives. Below are some links which I have found helpful.

If I have missed a reply to you, it is coming. And I will do better. I know that my replies are important to you. I want to re-iterate that your voice(s) are being heard.

With that out of the way, let’s get down to the heart of your president’s message. I want to acknowledge the concerns that our members have been bringing to the union office as well as their unions representatives in the various workplaces that CUPE 1287 represents. I want to assure the members that we take these concerns seriously, are forwarding them to the appropriate parties, be it the Emergency Operations Centre at the Niagara Region, Human Resources for our various Units in CUPE 1287, managers of departments, and so on. Continue to abide by the 6 feet/2 metres physical distancing. When this is not happening bring it your supervisors/managers attentions. If the issue is not resolved, please contact myself as per contact information below. A ” Letter of Understanding Re: Conducting Local Union Business During the COVID-19 Pandemic” has been sent to all our Units employers, which gives a clear message as to what the union is expecting from each of our employers during this pandemic. Our units in CUPE 1287 offer various community services that our families, our neighbours, our communities themselves are relying on. In a number of our units we are the safety net that many individuals rely on. We are also support staff to our co-workers, the technology support needed to keep communications open. Services such as keeping our homes and communities clean with garbage pickup, offering food banks and housing to the homeless, being a mental health resource to our communities, job supports to the unemployed, social assistance monies and supports, and the list goes on. We are the faces of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to our various communities in Niagara Region. Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication. These are not easy times. We are facing stresses in our homes lives and yes in our work lives. There are many questions coming to the Union office and our union representatives in our work places as per ‘essential services’, why are we still working, why can’t I work from home, is it safe to come to work, will my employer be topping up the EI services being offered. These are all viable questions and no one easy answer. The services that our CUPE 1287 units are offering are vital to our communities. In some cases we are public servants/municipal workers, in others we are offering services to people in need. When our grocery stores are open so we can buy food, when pharmacies are staying open for our medications, when liquor stores are staying open, when municipalities are still doing their work, this is the new ‘essential services’. If may not feel like it, but our employers are continuously assessing what can be done, what options can be put in place that keep people working What may have been off the table yesterday is on the table today. We may be re-deployed ( checked with National Rep and can occur). All employers have the mandate to provide safe workplaces and not putting their staff in harm’s way. They are following the advice and guidelines of our Public Health Department under the watchful eye of our Medical Office of Health, Dr. Hirji. A recent email to all Locals from our National President, Mark Hancock, has also re-iterated this “CUPE locals, councils, and divisions should follow directives from the public health authorities in their region”.
