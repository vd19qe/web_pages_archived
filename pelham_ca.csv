In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has closed all of its facilities, including municipal libraries to the walk-in public until further notice. During these closures, Town Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. No meeting shall exceed five (5) people. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings to five (5) or fewer people, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. While outdoor municipal parks remain open, it is recommended to avoid playground equipment, which is a potentially high contact area. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. While outdoor municipal parks remain open, it is recommended to avoid playground equipment, which is a potentially high contact area.

Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopening its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the MCC and Pool are open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. No meeting shall exceed five (5) people. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. While outdoor municipal parks remain open, it is recommended to avoid playground equipment, which is a potentially high contact area. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopening its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the MCC and Pool are open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. No meeting shall exceed five (5) people. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents.

Residents are asked to be mindful of when they park on the street and avoid doing so when available. Street sweeping is essential seasonal maintenance, and public safety is a primary concern. This maintenance removes debris from the gutters and roadsides that would otherwise end up going to the storm drains, causing water pollution, affecting fish or wildlife. It also reduces the chances of flooding – by keeping catch basins and drains clear of debris – and lessens the risk of skids and collisions. Street sweepers will be throughout town for approximately the next two weeks.

Clark noted that the Master Plan requires regular review and assessment to ensure progress, reflect changing conditions, update budget planning, and ensure milestones are met and celebrated. In 2018, Council approved a review of progress to-date. The PATC members volunteered to assist in the review. A high-level review was completed in June 2020. Clark, on behalf of the PATC, requested that Council accept the high-level review of the AT Master Plan and support the following four priorities: Complete a sidewalk gap analysis Move forward with wayfinding and signage Continue to review progress on the ATMP Ensure capital budget allocations are included in the long-term capital budget plan to incrementally address items outlined in the ATMP Sanitary Sewer Diversion at Summersides and Station Street As part of the East Fonthill development, the Summersides Boulevard road construction project originally included constructing a roundabout at the intersection of Station Street, Summersides Boulevard, and Pelham Town Square. Council deferred the roundabout construction to 2023; however, there are some sanitary sewer improvements required at this intersection to free up capacity at the Region's Hurricane Road pumping station and allow development to continue in East Fonthill north of Meridian Way. The delay in undertaking the sanitary sewer diversion work at Station Street and Summersides Boulevard has meant that servicing capacity with regards to sanitary sewers may not be available to these lands and puts the Town at significant risk and will result in an undue delay for these two development projects which does not benefit the Town. As a result, Pelham staff recommended proceeding with the sanitary sewer diversion at Summersides and Station Street now to make use of the materials that have already been purchased and provide relief to the existing sanitary sewer system currently near capacity, which would allow the developments in East Fonthill to proceed. The improvements will help resolve back up and flooding issues in the Hurricane Road sewer shed and help alleviate sewer capacity concerns in the College and Emmet area resulting from extraneous flows infiltrating system based on the age condition of the sewer. Staff recommended that the additional work to complete the sanitary sewer diversion project be awarded to Beam Excavating Inc. for $40,000 (excluding HST) and that the current scope of work to complete improvements at the intersection be amended to include the additional work. Council approved the funds, however, directed staff to follow the Town's purchasing policy for the selection of the successful contractor to complete the sanitary sewer diversion project at Summersides Boulevard and Station Street. Council seeks support on cannabis costs Councillor Lisa Haun sought and gained Council's support in petitioning multiple levels of government for assistance in the Town's costs of developing a municipal cannabis regulatory framework and the court challenges faced as a result. The full motion reads: Be it resolved that Pelham Town Council endorse the following resolutions as matters of highest priority: WHEREAS the Town of Pelham is a municipality of fewer than 18,000 persons; AND WHEREAS the Town has already spent in excess of $100,000 in legal and professional fees in developing a municipal, cannabis (which includes industrial hemp) regulatory framework and is bearing the entire cost of seven separate proceedings against that framework before the Superior Court of Justice, the Normal Farm Practices Protection Board, and/or the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (""LPAT""), which are currently estimated to cost the taxpayer over $300,000 to litigate; AND WHEREAS hundreds of residents have suffered ongoing adverse effects (particularly light and odour pollution) from cannabis facilities in the Town, and the Town will have to incur ongoing enforcement costs in order to have any hope of mitigating these adverse effects; AND WHEREAS the Town of Pelham is not the only municipality in Niagara, or in Ontario, that has suffered these adverse effects from these cannabis facilities which operate on an industrial scale; AND WHEREAS at present residents of the Town of Pelham are on track to pay 100% of the costs of civil cases that are precedential in nature and will impact neighbouring communities, all of Niagara, and ultimately have a provincial impact; NOW THEREFORE Pelham Town Council formally requests that the Region of Niagara seek ""Party"" status in the various LPAT proceedings that have been initiated by Woodstock Biomed Inc., CannTrust Holdings and Redecan Pharm as against Town of Pelham. As a Party, the Region can offer direct evidence, planning expertise and testimony in support of the Town of Pelham's recently amended Official Plan and Zoning Bylaw, which were adjusted with the approval of Regional Staff; AND FURTHER Pelham Town Council requests that Member of Provincial Parliament Sam Oosterhoff be requested to champion the Town's plight with the Provincial Government so as to result in the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing seeking ""Party"" status in the various LPAT proceedings that have been initiated by Woodstock Biomed Inc., CannTrust Holdings and Redecan Pharm as against Town of Pelham and a financial contribution from the Provincial Government towards the Town's litigation costs in recognition of the broader provincial public interest being represented; AND FURTHER that Niagara West MP Dean Allison be requested to champion the Town of Pelham's plight in the legislature (after it recommences sitting) and further pressure Health Canada to satisfy its own obligations with respect to enforcement of standards and regulations as they pertain to odour emissions from cannabis facilities, including providing a financial contribution towards the Town's litigation and enforcement costs in recognition of the broader public interest being represented. AND FURTHER that Niagara West MP Dean Allison be requested to obtain a clear and satisfactory answer from Health Canada as to why, after a year since CannTrust Holdings has acknowledged growing cannabis in a manner that contravened its license, no penalty or fine has been formally levied nor have charges been laid. AND FURTHER Pelham Town Council formally requests that the City of Welland and the City of Thorold each be asked to voluntarily contribute $15,000 (which represents 5% of the estimated litigation costs) towards defense of the aforementioned legal actions as Pelham has received complaints from residents of both those municipalities pertaining to light and/or smell associated with the industrial production of Cannabis.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made.

Approved by Council on Monday night, the 2020 event will have an expanded event footprint, putting physical distancing requirements, controlling the number of participants, and modeling similar to the successful 2020 Pelham Farmers Market layout and protocols in place. The other key element of the Christmas in Pelham season is the Santa Claus Parade, organized by the Fenwick Lions Club with support from the Town of Pelham staff. This annual event provides a ""family tradition"" for residents of the town. With the impact of COVID-19 on parades, a reverse parade model, supported by Town staff, was proposed for the 2020 season. The reverse parade would take the route off Canboro Road in Fenwick and into Centennial Park in Fenwick. The reverse parade allows for static floats along the park's designated route, and spectators would then drive through the event to see the floats Both elements of the Christmas in Pelham will be contingent on the most recent and changing requirements for attendees' safety regarding COVID-19 as deemed necessary by the Province of Ontario and the Niagara Region Public Health. Town staff continue to monitor and consult with industry professionals on best practices and update event plans as recommendations change. Both the Outdoor Christmas Market and the Santa Claus Reverse Parade would be cancelled if they could not adhere to any new restrictions that come into effect. Council receives petition for three-way stop sign at Pelham Street and Shorthills Place Council received a petition for the installation of a three-way stop sign at Pelham Street and Shorthills Place. Director of Public Works, Jason Marr, informed Council that these types of requests are often accompanied by a warrant study, similar to that of one conducted last year at Hurricane Road and Pelham Street; this study indicated that a three-way stop sign was not warrantees din this location. In accordance with the Town's traffic calming policy, Town staff will start collecting data to determine whether the Town would proceed with any traffic calming measures at this location. Public code of conduct policy Chief Administrative Officer David Cribbs introduced a public code of conduct policy on Monday night, receiving Council's approval. As per the report, ""The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly increased stress, anxiety and exacerbated mental health issues across Canada. Town staff have noticed a significant increase in the amount of conflict, bullying, harassment, ridicule and general opposition from members of the community as staff attempt to provide services. While the root cause of this behavioural shift may be understandable, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1, as amended, makes it clear that an employer must provide a safe and harassment free work environment. As such, Town administration recommends to Council the approval and adoption of the attached Public Code of Conduct. The purpose of the Code is to ensure that staff are free from bullying, harassment and discrimination while providing public services. The proposed Code of Conduct clearly communicates the steps to be taken if and when breaches occur, which potentially include blocks on electronic and telephone communication with staff, and/or the issuance of short term bans or longer term trespass orders at Town facilities. The purpose of the attached policy is to clearly define a Code of Conduct for community members accessing Town services, and outline procedures for dealing with inappropriate behaviour arising from the use of Town services. The policy covers all municipal property and special events and covers staff working out in the community at large (such as bylaw officers while on patrol, building inspections, parks staff, aquatics staff, etc.). The policy includes examples and the processes in place for staff in dealing with incidents from minor to major cases requiring a trespass order. Only the Fire Chief or Town Bylaw Enforcement Officers may issue trespass orders. The policy also covers incidents which occur during special events, on social media, traditional written communications and by phone."" Safe Restart Agreement-Municipal Operating Funding Council supported the assessment that the Town of Pelham’s financial situation requires provincial funding under Phase 2 on the basis that the funding under Phase 1 is not sufficient to address 2020 COVID-related operating pressures, and Town of Pelham’s decision to apply for Phase 2 funding. Under the federal-provincial Safe Restart Agreement, the Ontario government is providing up to $4 billion in emergency assistance so that municipalities are supported as they respond to COVID-19. As part of this agreement, $1.39 billion in funding is being made available to Ontario’s 444 municipalities in two phases for general municipal operating pressures. The government distributed $695 million in Phase 1. It will be distributing $695 million in Phase 2. Phase 1 funding was allocated to municipalities in August 2020, on a per household basis. The Town of Pelham received $428,500 towards the projected COVID-19 shortfall of $669,336 as reported on the July 27, 2020 report to Council. The Phase 2 funding template was released by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing on October 1, 2020. A webinar was held on October 5 discussing the application process and what items are eligible for Phase 2 funding. One of the requirements is a Council resolution that Council supports the application for Phase 2 funding based on the need of the funds. The deadline for the application is October 30, 2020. The reporting template will have actual revenue and expenditures to September 30 and projected revenue and expenditures from October 1 to December 31. The reporting format is based on the Financial Information Return categories. The timelines for gathering the information is tight. A decision on the amount of Phase 2 funding will be made before the end of December 31, 2020. Payments of this grant will be made in early January 2021.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

After careful consideration and discussion of Provincial and Regional Public Health guidelines and recommendations, the decision to cancel the event is in the best interest of health and safety pursuant to Public Health guidelines. Though the Christmas Market is not running this year, some of the most cherished market traditions will surface within a variety of other planned events. “We know that people were looking forward to the Christmas Market, this year especially, and it’s disappointing that we had to cancel,” said Mayor Marvin Junkin. “The good news is that Town staff are working on a variety of events and activities for Pelham residents to enjoy within the best public health guidelines; everyone’s safety is our main priority.” Those missing the sights of the holidays at the market are encouraged to participate in the Christmas lights competition and self-guided tour, whether by decorating their home or travelling the route to view Pelham’s most decorated homes. The official route will be posted on the Town’s website after the Dec. 13 entry date has passed. Winter break camp, free skates, and Santa’s Workshop all remain on the calendar this year. New this year is the Town’s assistance in helping Pelham children get their letters to Santa. To learn more about these events, please visit www.pelham.ca/christmas. All events are subject to change based on Provincial and Regional Public Health recommendations.

For more than 15 years, Stirton has defended municipalities across southwestern Ontario in a wide range of cases. A graduate from Osgoode Hall Law School in 2002, in the top nine percent of her class, Stirton also holds an Honours Bachelor of Science from McMaster University. Stirton articled and practiced at a national firm in Toronto until 2005 before joining McCall Dawson LLP, a litigation firm in London focusing on municipal clients, practicing as an associate and a partner. Stirton has represented municipalities and other local public authorities before all court levels in Ontario. “I am thrilled to be the new Town Solicitor for the Town of Pelham, Town of Fort Erie and Township of Wainfleet,” said Stirton. “I look forward to focusing on the legal needs of the three municipalities in service to the communities.” The innovative initiative is expected to reduce legal costs and is, to the municipalities’ understanding, the first such shared in-house position in Ontario. The agreement positions all three municipalities to reduce their legal expenditures, supporting financial sustainability. “Local governments in Niagara are again being municipal innovators,” said Pelham Mayor Marvin Junkin. “All three municipalities will be saving our taxpayers money and bringing valuable expertise and skill to our teams, while engaging in cost-sharing services with our municipal neighbours. This hiring is significant on many levels.” Stirton will take over routine legal matters, leaving conflict work and specialized work to the municipalities’ highly capable external legal counsel. The process, beginning in March 2020, received full support from all three Councils. In the agreed-upon terms, Stirton will be a direct employee of the Town of Pelham; however, all three municipalities will contribute towards employment costs. It is anticipated that the exact amount of time worked for any municipality will vary from month-to-month but is expected to ultimately result in a 40-40-20 (Pelham, Fort Erie, Wainfleet, respectively) split based on historical data. If the percentage paid by each municipality requires future adjustment, contractual and budgeting processes will address the issue. All three municipalities warmly welcome Jennifer Stirton to Niagara and look forward to benefiting from her skills and knowledge in the years to come. -30- For more information, please contact: Marc MacDonald Town of Pelham Communications and Public Relations Specialist 905-892-2607 x309 mmacdonald@pelham.ca Janine Tessmer Town of Fort Erie Communications Advisor 905-871-1600 x2217 jtessmer@forterie.ca Lee Gudgeon, B.A., D.H.S., M.A. Township of Wainfleet Manager of HR / Communications 905-899-3463 x243 lgudgeon@wainfleet.ca Pelham, Fort Erie and Wainfleet get innovative in addressing legal costs, hire shared solicitor (pdf) Contact Us Subscribe to this page A-Z Services|Accessibility and Inclusion|Freedom of Information|Terms of Use Legal Disclaimer|Privacy Policy|Sitemap|Website Feedback|Contact Us © 2019 Town of Pelham 20 Pelham Town Square P.O.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

Pelham Council approved the creation of the plan for 2021, allowing all taxpayers whose taxes were paid in full as of February 28, 2020, and who have since experienced severe financial hardship due to the pandemic, to pay their outstanding 2020 and 2021 property taxes penalty and interest-free over a 10- month period starting March 2021. Applications are due by February 19, 2021, for the 10-month payment period. After this date, applicants will see the payment period reduced by the number of months left in 2021. The application-based program allows for all property taxpayers to pay their outstanding 2020 tax balance (including any penalty and interest charged), in addition to their 2021 taxes, through pre-authorized payments over 10 equal instalments on the 15th of each month from March 15, 2021, to December 15, 2021. The Town will not charge a penalty, and interest will not be charged on accounts for this pre-authorized plan. If a payment returns NSF, the property tax account holder must replace the payment within the first month of default. A $30 NSF fee will be charged for the returned transaction. If the payment is not replaced within one month, the account will be removed from the program, and the normal penalty and interest will apply as of the date of default. Program restrictions: • All applications must be made on the Town's form and must include documentation that reasonably and sufficiently establishes eligibility under the pre-authorized payment program. • Applications will automatically be denied if false, inaccurate or insufficient information is provided. Eligibility for inclusion in the program will be determined at the time the application is first approved, and changes in financial circumstances before December 1, 2021, will not affect eligibility. • The Treasurer's determinations with respect to eligibility shall be final.

Restaurants have been significantly impacted due to the restrictions on their operations and some have not survived. The permission to allow ‘pop-up’ patios in the parking lots during the summer and fall months of 2020 was important to many of these business and it is anticipated that with the COVID-19 pandemic extending well into 2021 it will continue to have a significant impact on the operations of these businesses. By continuing to temporarily waive the requirement of up to 6 parking spaces for restaurants and allow those spaces to be uses as ‘pop- up’ patios during the pandemic in 2021 will be a support for these businesses and is consistent with the provincial government’s directive to provide flexibility to these businesses. The Town also has a Sidewalk Encroachment Policy that allows for restaurants to apply to the Town for permission to encroach on the municipal right-of-way i.e. the sidewalk, for outdoor sidewalk patio use subject to meeting the policy requirements related to proof of insurance, provincial licensing requirements, pedestrian accessibility requirements and urban design zoning, sign and Building Code requirements. Approval of sidewalk patios under the Sidewalk Encroachment policy is managed through the Clerk’s Office and there is no fee associated with this permission. It is recognized that outdoor restaurant patios contribute positively to the vitality of downtowns, main streets and public spaces. Staff recognize the need to open the economy slowly and safely during the COVID19 pandemic and at the same time want to support local restaurants in their ability to offer a dining and food experience. It is recognized that ‘pop-up’ parking lot patios are temporary in nature and will only be allowed during the period of pandemic. Also, it is acknowledged that the ‘pop-up’ parking lot patios provide some opportunity for restaurants to offer hospitality service and the waiving of up to six parking space requirements supports these small businesses during a very difficult economic time. In 2020 all of the ‘pop-up’ parking lot patios occurred on private property and were subject to meeting Public Health protocols and Provincial licensing requirements related to food service and serving of alcohol. Should a ‘pop-up’ parking lot patio be proposed on municipal property, in addition to meeting Public Health, accessibility, and licensing requirements, the proponent would be required to provide evidence of having the liability and property damage insurance in the amount of $2,000,0000 in place for the patio area and name the Town as an insured entity prior to being allowed to operate the patio on municipal property. By continuing to allow the temporary ‘pop-up’ parking lot patios during the pandemic, in addition to the sidewalk patios, Council continues to provide support to these local businesses. The only cost associated with the extension of the program is the value of staff time. No additional monies are required to deliver the serice and permit the existence of temporary ‘pop-up’ parking lot patios. Continuing to allow the temporary ‘pop-up’ patios for restaurants supports local businesses during the pandemic and is one measure that the Town can offer to help these businesses survive the pandemic. Motion re: Toronto Dominion Bank Pelham Branch Closure WHEREAS the Toronto Dominion Bank has notified is customers that they are closing the Fonthill Branch July 16, 2021; AND WHEREAS Council believes the Toronto Dominion Bank has not taken into full consideration the fact that Pelham is a fast growing municipality with many current and future residents depending on their in-person financial services; AND WHEREAS the Town of Pelham has a large and growing senior population who will be seriously impacted by this closure; AND WHEREAS a trip to a neighbouring city to a bank that is already overly busy is unacceptable; AND WHEREAS many residents of the Town of Pelham are not tech savvy enough or do not have suitable access for internet banking; NOW THEREFORE Council for the Town of Pelham asks that the Toronto Dominion Bank seriously take into account these concerns and reconsider the closure of the Fonthill Branch.

The current by-law is outdated, requiring updating as significant time has elapsed since prepared initially more than 30 years ago. The review ensures the new by-law represents current development trends and will be flexible to respond to future changes. Additionally, the Zoning By-law needs to be updated to conform with the Town Official Plan. ""There have been some fundamental shifts in the focus of the provincial, regional, and local policy framework since the original 1987 zoning by-law,"" said director of community planning and development Barb Wiens. ""The Town has the responsibility to bring the Zoning By-law in line with the current planning policy framework at all levels of government."" The Comprehensive Zoning By-law being proposed is a hybrid, using contextual zoning primarily in the Town's greenfield areas and conventional zoning in the built-up areas and rural agricultural areas of the Town. The Town is offering the public an opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process and provide input on land-use issues that affect them. Planning staff want residents to participate in the review process and release draft sections of the proposed zoning by-law for review and comment online. The current schedule is: Date Topic March 15-19, 2021 General Provisions March 22 – April 2, 2021 Rural/Agricultural Zones April 5-16, 2021 Residential Zones and Greenfield Development April 19-30, 2021 Commercial Zones May 3-7, 2021 Definitions May 10-14, 2021 Review of feedback received A zoning by-law allows the Town to regulate such things as how land and buildings are used, the type of structures that can be constructed, the height of buildings, the size of properties, landscaping requirements, and many other features shaping the physical attributes of buildings and land in Town. The new Zoning By-law for Pelham will reflect the Town's unique community structure. The Town encompasses well-developed and complete urban communities that include existing development areas and new greenfield opportunities, a village and a smaller hamlet, and the diverse rural and agricultural land use context. The need to update the Zoning By-law provides the Town with a unique opportunity to assess historic zoning practices and implement contemporary and innovative development regulation strategies. As part of the Town's public engagement strategy for this review, the Town's policy planner will be hosting a live Q&A session on the Town's public engagement site every Tuesday beginning March 16, 2021. Residents can submit questions and request one-on-one appointments through the site or by calling 905-892-2607 x335. – 30 – For media inquiries, please contact: Marc MacDonald Communications and Public Relations Specialist 905-892-2607 x309 mmacdonald@pelham.ca Feedback sought in Comprehensive Zoning By-Law review (pdf) Contact Us Subscribe to this page A-Z Services|Accessibility and Inclusion|Freedom of Information|Terms of Use Legal Disclaimer|Privacy Policy|Sitemap|Website Feedback|Contact Us © 2019 Town of Pelham 20 Pelham Town Square P.O.

The current by-law is outdated, requiring updating as significant time has elapsed since prepared initially more than 30 years ago. The review ensures the new by-law represents current development trends and will be flexible to respond to future changes. Additionally, the Zoning By-law needs to be updated to conform with the Town Official Plan. ""There have been some fundamental shifts in the focus of the provincial, regional, and local policy framework since the original 1987 zoning by-law,"" said director of community planning and development Barb Wiens. ""The Town has the responsibility to bring the Zoning By-law in line with the current planning policy framework at all levels of government."" The Comprehensive Zoning By-law being proposed is a hybrid, using contextual zoning primarily in the Town's greenfield areas and conventional zoning in the built-up areas and rural agricultural areas of the Town. The Town is offering the public an opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process and provide input on land-use issues that affect them. Planning staff want residents to participate in the review process and release draft sections of the proposed zoning by-law for review and comment online. The current schedule is: Date Topic March 15-19, 2021 General Provisions March 22 – April 2, 2021 Rural/Agricultural Zones April 5-16, 2021 Residential Zones and Greenfield Development April 19-30, 2021 Commercial Zones May 3-7, 2021 Definitions May 10-14, 2021 Review of feedback received A zoning by-law allows the Town to regulate such things as how land and buildings are used, the type of structures that can be constructed, the height of buildings, the size of properties, landscaping requirements, and many other features shaping the physical attributes of buildings and land in Town. The new Zoning By-law for Pelham will reflect the Town's unique community structure. The Town encompasses well-developed and complete urban communities that include existing development areas and new greenfield opportunities, a village and a smaller hamlet, and the diverse rural and agricultural land use context. The need to update the Zoning By-law provides the Town with a unique opportunity to assess historic zoning practices and implement contemporary and innovative development regulation strategies. As part of the Town's public engagement strategy for this review, the Town's policy planner will be hosting a live Q&A session on the Town's public engagement site every Tuesday beginning March 16, 2021. Residents can submit questions and request one-on-one appointments through the site or by calling 905-892-2607 x335. – 30 – For media inquiries, please contact: Marc MacDonald Communications and Public Relations Specialist 905-892-2607 x309 mmacdonald@pelham.ca Feedback sought in Comprehensive Zoning By-Law review (pdf) Contact Us Subscribe to this page A-Z Services|Accessibility and Inclusion|Freedom of Information|Terms of Use Legal Disclaimer|Privacy Policy|Sitemap|Website Feedback|Contact Us © 2019 Town of Pelham 20 Pelham Town Square P.O.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.

Danby Award for its role in developing, sharing, and executing safe and successful practices during last year’s by-election. The E.A. Danby Award is a tiered awards program based on the size of the municipality. In Ontario, there are 444 municipalities, and each year, the Association of Municipal Managers, Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario recognizes municipalities with populations less than 20,000 and those with larger populations. The E.A. Danby Award focuses on initiatives that fall within the broad categories of finance, administration and implementation of legislation and recognizes one or more municipalities that demonstrate an initiative or a willingness to explore innovative techniques that produce tangible results related to the efficiency and effectiveness of the municipal corporation. “If ever there was evidence of positive inter-municipal cooperation and collaboration, this is it,” said Town Clerk Holly Willford. “Though we were the smallest municipality in this group, we weren’t spectators; we were active contributors and the first of the four to hold our by-election. Nancy Bozzato guided Pelham through this process, and the by-election’s success is in great part because of her leadership, knowledge and expertise.” Along with members from the City of Ottawa, the City of Windsor, and the City of Cambridge, Pelham staff developed protocols and procedures for running a by-election during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, the working group members from the four municipalities and the leaders of their respective by-elections were all women. In Pelham, this group included now-retired Clerk Nancy Bozzato, former Deputy Clerk and current Town Clerk Holly Willford, and current Deputy Clerk Sarah Leach. The by-election in 2020 was the first in Pelham since 2011, and despite being held during the peak of the pandemic and among stringent public health measures, 2020 saw an increase in voter turnout. Community engagement strategies were particularly effective in increasing voter turnout and included voter notification packages with detailed information on COVID-19 safety precautions, the process of submitting a mail-in ballot, and a comprehensive communication strategy. -30- For media inquiries, please contact: Marc MacDonald Communications and Public Relations Specialist 905-892-2607 x309 mmacdonald@pelham.ca Town of Pelham receives top municipal award for work on by-election (pdf) Contact Us Subscribe to this page A-Z Services|Accessibility and Inclusion|Freedom of Information|Terms of Use Legal Disclaimer|Privacy Policy|Sitemap|Website Feedback|Contact Us © 2019 Town of Pelham 20 Pelham Town Square P.O.

The operating and water and wastewater budgets have been scheduled for completion in January 2022. The Pelham Finance and Audit Committee will review the 2022 budgets prior to the Council presentation of the budgets. The proposed 2022 Budget Schedule will act as a guide to help the Corporate Services Department plan budget events during the course of the budget process. The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic is changing rapidly, and its impact on the 2022 budget is uncertain at this time. Should issues arise which affect the ability to meet the dates indicated, a revision to the schedule may berequired. Any items of this nature will be brought forward for Council’s information and approval. The location of the meetings, and whether they will be physical or electronic, will be determined in the future in keeping with the best health information available. Date Purpose Tuesday, September 13, 2021 5:30pm Public Meeting - To receive input into Town’s 2022 Budget Monday, November 8, 2021 Draft Capital, Operating and Water & Wastewater Budgets Available for Council & Pelham Finance and Audit Committee Review Wednesday, November 24, 2021 4:00pm Draft Capital, Operating and Water & Wastewater Budgets Finance and Audit Committee Review Monday, November 29, 2021 5:30pm Capital Budget Special Meeting - Presentation at General Committee Tuesday, December 14, 2021 5:30pm Operating and Water & Wastewater Budgets Special Meeting Presentation at General Committee Monday, December 20, 2021 5:30pm Capital Budget Consideration for Approval at Council Monday, January 24, 2022 5:30pm Operating and Water & Wastewater Budgets Consideration for Approval at Council Green and Inclusive Community Building Grants On October 7, 2019 Council received report# 2019-0099-Corporate Services and approved the grant submission of the ICIP: Community, Culture and Recreation Stream. One of projects that was listed on this grant application included the construction of public restrooms and event facilities at Town Hall and renovations to the Pelham Library in Fonthill. On October 28, 2019 a verbal update was provided to Council that this grant application would include a $8 Million request for building an addition to the Meridian Community Centre (MCC) for the Pelham Library instead of a renovation to the existing library. The Town has not been official notified as to the status of these requests. The Ministry grant portal shows these projects are still opened under review. In April 2021, Infrastructure Canada issued the Green and Inclusive Community Buildings (GICB) fund. This is a federal government initiative. It is a five-year $1.5 billion fund which aims to build more community buildings and improve existing ones, particularly in areas with populations experiencing higher needs while also making buildings more efficient, lower carbon, more resilient and higher performing. The grant program supports green and accessible retrofits, repairs and upgrades of existing public community buildings and the construction of new publicly accessible community buildings that serve high-needs, underserved communities across Canada. 1.Retrofits of community buildings: -$860 million available -To be completed between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2026 -Federal funding is 80/20 for retrofits <$10 million -Federal funding is 60/40 for retrofits $10 million or more -Green retrofit measures are those that renovate, upgrade, and/or repair aspects of a physical building in a way that improves environmental outcomes. -All retrofit project applicants will be required to submit their building’s structural information, energy profile, and GHG emissions using the RETScreen® Expert software. The software is free to download. 2. New construction of community buildings: -$430 million available -To be completed between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2026 -Federal funding is 60/40 for new builds <$10 million -Federal funding is 50/50 for new builds between $10 million and $25 million -New builds must be of a building/asset that is open and accessible to the public and that will provide non-commercial services to the community. $150 million has been allocated to projects for Indigenous communities. Municipalities, regions, provinces public sector, Indigenous groups, non-profits all eligible to apply. Multiple applications allowed. Buildings NOT eligible: Administrative buildings, Hospitals, fire stations, police station, EMT stations, day care centres, shelters, Multi-unit housing and hospices. The Town would like to resubmit the two projects relating to the new library addition at the MCC and build a carbon zero additiona; and also retrofit Town Hall to make it more efficient while adding on the public restrooms and event facility. The Town has had discussions with Petroff, the Architect firm that designed the MCC to receive a quote to help the Town complete the technical section of the grant application. They have already prepared a schematic drawing of the library addition in order to see how the addition will fit at the MCC for the grant application in November 2019. The cost to the Town for the retrofit to Town Hall is 20% of the cost. For the new library addition, the cost will be 40% to the Town. The sale of the existing library will offset the Town’s cost, so the net impact to the Town will be zero. Mandatory Mask Bylaw Extension In March of 2020 a pandemic was declared due to the outbreak of COVID-19. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus on August 10, 2020, Council for the Town of Pelham passed By-Law No. 4270(2020) requiring mandatory face coverings in enclosed public places. On September 21, 2020, Council extended the Mandatory Face Covering By-law until December 7, 2020 by resolution. On October 19, 2020, Council passed By-law Amendment No. 4285(2020) extending the By-law to include common areas of residential apartment buildings and condominium buildings. On December 7, 2020, Council further passed By-law Amendment No. 4295(2020) to further extend the mandatory face covering bylaw which is due to expire on August 31, 2021. On March 25, 2021, Niagara Regional Council voted to extend The Niagara Region’s Temporary Face-covering By-law to expire when Provincial requirements no longer require mandatory face coverings in all enclosed public spaces within the Niagara Region. The Regional By-law aligns with face covering orders issued by the Province of Ontario under the Reopening Ontario Act, 2020. S.O. 2020. c.17. Pursuant to the Reopening Ontario Act, amended order O. Reg 364/20, the use of masks or face coverings is mandatory in all public spaces, workplaces and vehicles that operate as part of a business or organization. Face coverings must fit securely to an individual’s head, be made of at least two layers of tightly woven material and be large enough to cover the nose, mouth and chin. The Town of Pelham is committed to the health and safety of its residents, visitors and in the fight against COVID-19. Staff recommend the Town’s Mandatory Face Covering By-Law be amended to expire when Provincial requirements no longer require mandatory face coverings in all enclosed public spaces within the Niagara Region. The proposed amendment is intended to align the Town of Pelham’s By-law with the Niagara Region’s Face Covering By-law and orders issued by the Province under the Reopening Ontario Act. It is important to remember that COVID-19 continues to be a significant public health concern, which has been exacerbated by the spread of COVID-19 variants. While Niagara’s vaccination efforts continue, it is important to follow the public health measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 including physical distancing, hand hygiene and wearing a proper face covering in public spaces.

In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to both the public and Town Staff, the Town has reopened its facilities based on strict public health guidelines. Town Hall is open by appointment only, and the Meridian Community Centre is open with limited capacity and by pre-registering for programs. Before reopening, a variety of pre-return checks, tasks, and assessments were completed to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone, including preparing the building with floor stickers for appropriate distancing, preparing staff and their workspaces, controlling access to buildings through screening, reducing touchpoints, and increasing cleaning. All meeting rooms will be wiped down and cleaned after each meeting and individual offices will not be used for meetings. Welcoming guests in this manner ensures the health and safety of Town staff and the public. Residents who wish to make water or tax payments are encouraged to sign up for preauthorized payments or can do so via online or in-person banking; cheques can also be dropped off at the Town Hall drop box outside the lower level doors. Staff continue to be available to assist the public, Monday - Friday, 8:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. by phone at 905-892-2607 or by email. To conduct business at Town Hall, the Town encourages people to make contact by telephone or electronically. For matters where it is impractical to do so, pre-arranged appointments can be made. For a complete list of employee contact information, click here. Alternative options for payment of taxes and fees include payment through a financial institution, pre-authorized payment and cheque payment. A drop box outside of Town Hall is also available to deposit cheques and documents. We remind residents that all Council meetings are livestreamed through the Town of Pelham YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/townofpelham/live Residents are strongly encouraged to practice physical distancing, limit all public gatherings, avoid touching your face and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is suitable when soap and water is unavailable. Returning home from travelling abroad? If you and/or your family have just returned to Canada: Self-isolate for 14 days Ask a friend or family member to help you get a supply of groceries & other necessities, don't go out and get them yourself. Have them drop at your door. No visitors No play dates Monitor your health Travel Advice & Restrictions The Government of Canada has a number of standard border measures in place to prevent communicable diseases from being introduced to or spreading in Canada. Additional measures have been implemented including messaging on arrivals screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. In addition, a health screening question has been added to electronic kiosks. All non-essential border crossings are no longer allowed. Crossings are for commercial trade only to keep Ontario & Canada's supply chain functioning.
