Effective May 4, the decision to close Welcome Wagon Ltd. has been made. This decision has been very heartbreaking and difficult to make. Welcome Wagon was inspired by frontier settlers and their Conestoga Wagons in the mid to late 1800’s. Their communal ways of greeting new settlers on the prairies laid the foundation for Welcome Wagon. Welcome Wagon Ltd was incorporated as a wholly Canadian operation in 1979. We have been very proud to serve you for these many years. Thank you for supporting Welcome Wagon over the last 90 years. Best wishes. Copyright 2020 Website.com. All Rights Reserved.
