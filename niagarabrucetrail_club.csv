Contact Us Latest News MARCH 27, 2020 - MESSAGE FROM BRUCE TRAIL CONSERVANCY CEO MICHAEL MCDONALD We didn’t think we’d ever be encouraging people to stay off the Bruce Trail, but unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. For the safety of our communities, and to assist the province with its efforts to keep our communities safe as the COVID-19 pandemic quickly evolves, I have an important request: Please postpone your use of the Bruce Trail for walks or hikes until further notice, to minimize the spread or contraction of COVID-19. We realize that we cannot close-off the Bruce Trail. We cannot bar access to all trailheads nor enforce closures. We can and do, however, urge everyone to please stay away from the Bruce Trail until further notice. Many popular areas have seen increased crowding in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. And even beyond these areas, travelling to and on the Trail puts local communities, hikers, and our health system at risk. I know this is hard. For many of us, the Bruce Trail is an escape from the stresses of difficult times. We know hiking is good for our overall physical and mental health. It is heartbreaking to dissuade people from using our wonderful footpath, but it is absolutely crucial that we all do what we can to limit the spread of COVID-19. Our public health officials have sent us a clear message; stay home, and stay safe. Many parks, conservation areas, municipalities and other landowners along the Bruce Trail have already made the difficult decision to close their facilities and access to trails. In these areas, hikers should consider the Bruce Trail closed. We support these organizations and landowners in their closures to halt the spread of the virus. During this uncertain time, please know the Bruce Trail Conservancy is here for you. Although our Bruce Trail Conservancy office is closed, our staff are working remotely and will continue to be available by email and phone. Our main source of contact is: info@brucetrail.org or 1-800-665-4453. I thank you for your patience and understanding during these challenging times. The Bruce Trail will be there for us all to enjoy when the pandemic comes to an end. Stay well and be safe. Michael McDonald CEO, Bruce Trail Conservancy Effective immediately all NBTC led hikes are cancelled until April 30, 2020. See the following BTC communication for full details Fort-to-Fort 2020, April 18-19 - CANCELLED for 2020 Abbey Road Concert - changed from March 28 to June 27, 2020 An Update to Our BTC Members Regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19), March 16 We have been monitoring the COVID-19 situation and after thought and careful consideration, the Bruce Trail Conservancy and its Clubs are making changes to our operations and events. The health and safety of our staff and members is always our priority and we are doing our part to act responsibly and to help stop the spread of the virus. We appreciate your help and understanding during these unprecedented times. Bruce Trail Conservancy Office Beginning Tuesday, March 17, 2020 the Bruce Trail Conservancy office at 55 Head St. in Dundas will be closed and our staff will work remotely until at least April 6, 2020. We continue to be available by email and phone, and our online membership, donation and store processes will remain in operation. We hope to maintain our current levels of service but appreciate everyone’s understanding and patience during this time. We will have limited access to letter mail via Canada Post.

Product orders, End-to-End certificates, and membership packages will not be shipped until after the office re-opens. Bruce Trail Conservancy Events All Bruce Trail Conservancy events between now and April 30, 2020 will be rescheduled to a later date. Bruce Trail Club Events & Hikes All organized hikes across all 9 Clubs are being cancelled until April 30, 2020. We recognize the hike program represents an important outlet for many of our members to reduce stress, socialize and stay physically active. The Bruce Trail Conservancy has made this important decision to be proactive, to do our part to support the health care system, and to keep our volunteers and members safe. The following other Club events and programs are affected through April 30th: Club social events & workshops are cancelled or postponed Club Annual General Meetings to be held by teleconference Trail Angels (trailhead transportation program) cancelled Trail maintenance group activities cancelled Bruce Trail The Bruce Trail itself remains open. Keep in mind that some access points, washrooms or visitor centres operated by our partnering conservation organizations (like parks and conservation areas) may be closed. Covid 19 - NBTC Club Guidelines, Sunday March 15, 2020. 4:30pm As you are aware there is at present a lot of anxiety and concern surrounding the COVID-19 or as it is commonly known as, the coronavirus. The official government directive currently suggests that social gatherings in excess of 250 people should be discontinued. At the NBTC we share the concerns of our members but believe that with the appropriate levels of caution and common sense measures our hiking program can continue with some modifications. We believe that being outside in the fresh air is beneficial providing that risk mitigating measures are followed. Accordingly, we provide the following guidelines that should be followed with immediate effect going forward and until otherwise advised. ✔ No carpooling hikes will take place. Existing hikes scheduled as carpooling will be modified by the hike leader as a loop or an “in and out” hike. This will be clarified with the group at the start of the hike. ✔ Pens or pencils used in the sign-up sheet must be cleaned with a wipe after each use. Ideally a separate pen or pencil should be used of each ✔ The hike leader will emphasize the requirement for social distancing encouraging hikers to remain at least arm’s length apart. Note that this will not be required for family members (youth hikes) ✔ At the start of each hike the hike leader should ask that anybody feeling unwell with a cough and / or high temperature should not participate in the hike. We will be monitoring the situation and will make a decision about delaying or cancelling our Abbey Road Fundraiser to be held on March 29.
