When will the Covid-19 pandemic end? And how? According to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes. “When people ask, ‘When will this end?,’ they are asking about the social ending,” said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins. In other words, an end can occur not because a disease has been vanquished but because people grow tired of panic mode and learn to live with a disease. Allan Brandt, a Harvard historian, said something similar was happening with Covid-19: “As we have seen in the debate about opening the economy, many questions about the so-called end are determined not by medical and public health data but by sociopolitical processes.” Endings “are very, very messy,” said Dora Vargha, a historian at the University of Exeter. “Looking back, we have a weak narrative. For whom does the epidemic end, and who gets to say?” In the path of fear An epidemic of fear can occur even without an epidemic of illness. Dr. Susan Murray, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, saw that firsthand in 2014 when she was a fellow at a rural hospital in Ireland. In the preceding months, more than 11,000 people in West Africa had died from Ebola, a terrifying viral disease that was highly infectious and often fatal. The epidemic seemed to be waning, and no cases had occurred in Ireland, but the public fear was palpable. “On the street and on the wards, people are anxious,” Dr. Murray recalled recently in an article in The New England Journal of Medicine. “Having the wrong color skin is enough to earn you the side-eye from your fellow passengers on the bus or train. Cough once, and you will find them shuffling away from you.” The Dublin hospital workers were warned to prepare for the worst. They were terrified, and worried that they lacked protective equipment. When a young man arrived in the emergency room from a country with Ebola patients, no one wanted to go near him; nurses hid, and doctors threatened to leave the hospital. Dr. Murray alone dared treat him, she wrote, but his cancer was so advanced that all she could offer was comfort care. A few days later, tests confirmed that the man did not have Ebola; he died an hour later. Three days afterward, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola epidemic over. Dr. Murray wrote: “If we are not prepared to fight fear and ignorance as actively and as thoughtfully as we fight any other virus, it is possible that fear can do terrible harm to vulnerable people, even in places that never see a single case of infection during an outbreak. And a fear epidemic can have far worse consequences when complicated by issues of race, privilege, and language.” Black Death and dark memories Image Disinfecting an autopsy table at a plague hospital in Mukden, China, in 1910, during a wave of pneumonic plague, also caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis.Credit...Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG, via Getty Images Bubonic plague has struck several times in the past 2,000 years, killing millions of people and altering the course of history. Each epidemic amplified the fear that came with the next outbreak. The disease is caused by a strain of bacteria, Yersinia pestis, that lives on fleas that live on rats. But bubonic plague, which became known as the Black Death, also can be passed from infected person to infected person through respiratory droplets, so it cannot be eradicated simply by killing rats. Historians describe three great waves of plague, said Mary Fissell, a historian at Johns Hopkins: the Plague of Justinian, in the sixth century; the medieval epidemic, in the 14th century; and a pandemic that struck in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The medieval pandemic began in 1331 in China. The illness, along with a civil war that was raging at the time, killed half the population of China. From there, the plague moved along trade routes to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In the years between 1347 and 1351, it killed at least a third of the European population. Half of the population of Siena, Italy, died. “It is impossible for the human tongue to recount the awful truth,” wrote the 14th-century chronicler Agnolo di Tura. “Indeed, one who did not see such horribleness can be called blessed.” The infected, he wrote, “swell beneath the armpits and in their groins, and fall over while talking.” The dead were buried in pits, in piles. In Florence, wrote Giovanni Boccaccio, “No more respect was accorded to dead people than would nowadays be accorded to dead goats.” Some hid in their homes. Others refused to accept the threat. Their way of coping, Boccaccio wrote, was to “drink heavily, enjoy life to the full, go round singing and merrymaking, and gratify all of one’s cravings when the opportunity emerged, and shrug the whole thing off as one enormous joke.” That pandemic ended, but the plague recurred. One of the worst outbreaks began in China in 1855 and spread worldwide, killing more than 12 million in India alone. Health authorities in Bombay burned whole neighborhoods trying to rid them of the plague. “Nobody knew if it made a difference,” the Yale historian Frank Snowden said. Image Dissecting rats in New Orleans in 1914 for signs that they might be carrying bubonic plague.Credit...Corbis, via Getty Images It is not clear what made the bubonic plague die down. Some scholars have argued that cold weather killed the disease-carrying fleas, but that would not have interrupted the spread by the respiratory route, Dr. Snowden noted. Or perhaps it was a change in the rats. By the 19th century, the plague was being carried not by black rats but by brown rats, which are stronger and more vicious and more likely to live apart from humans.

See more updates Updated 11m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York “You certainly wouldn’t want one for a pet,” Dr. Snowden said. Another hypothesis is that the bacterium evolved to be less deadly. Or maybe actions by humans, such as the burning of villages, helped quell the epidemic. The plague never really went away. In the United States, infections are endemic among prairie dogs in the Southwest and can be transmitted to people. Dr. Snowden said that one of his friends became infected after a stay at a hotel in New Mexico. The previous occupant of his room had a dog, which had fleas that carried the microbe. Such cases are rare, and can now be successfully treated with antibiotics, but any report of a case of the plague stirs up fear. One disease that actually ended Image Edward Jenner, one of the early developers of the smallpox vaccine, inoculating a child from the disease in 1796.Credit...Hulton Archive/Getty Images Among the diseases to have achieved a medical end is smallpox. But it is exceptional for several reasons: There is an effective vaccine, which gives lifelong protection; the virus, Variola major, has no animal host, so eliminating the disease in humans meant total elimination; and its symptoms are so unusual that infection is obvious, allowing for effective quarantines and contact tracing. But while it still raged, smallpox was horrific. Epidemic after epidemic swept the world, for at least 3,000 years. Individuals infected with the virus developed a fever, then a rash that turned into pus-filled spots, which became encrusted and fell off, leaving scars. The disease killed three out of 10 of its victims, often after immense suffering. In 1633, an epidemic among Native Americans “disrupted all the native communities in the northeast and certainly facilitated English settlement in Massachusetts,” said Harvard historian Dr. David S. Jones. William Bradford, leader of the Plymouth colony, wrote an account of the disease in Native Americans, saying the broken pustules would effectively glue a patient’s skin to the mat he lay on, only to be torn off. Bradford wrote: “When they turn them, a whole side will flay off at once as it were, and they will be all of a gore blood, most fearful to behold.” The last person to contract smallpox naturally was Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Somalia, in 1977. He recovered, only to die of malaria in 2013. Forgotten influenzas The 1918 flu is held up today as the example of the ravages of a pandemic and the value of quarantines and social distancing. Before it ended, the flu killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide. It preyed on young to middle-aged adults — orphaning children, depriving families of breadwinners, killing troops in the midst of World War I. In the autumn of 1918, Victor Vaughan, a prominent doctor, was dispatched to Camp Devens near Boston to report on a flu that was raging there. He saw “hundreds of stalwart young men in the uniform of their country, coming into the wards of the hospital in groups of ten or more,” he wrote. “They are placed on the cots until every bed is full, yet others crowd in. Their faces soon wear a bluish cast, a distressing cough brings up blood stained sputum. In the morning the dead bodies are stacked up in the morgue like cord wood.” The virus, he wrote, “demonstrated the inferiority of human inventions in the destruction of human life.” Image Red Cross volunteers in Piedmont, Calif., making masks in October 1918.Credit...Edward (Doc) Rogers/MediaNews Group/Oakland Tribune, via Getty Images After sweeping through the world, that flu faded away, evolving into a variant of the more benign flu that comes around every year. “Maybe it was like a fire that, having burned the available and easily accessible wood, burns down,” Dr. Snowden said. It ended socially, too. World War I was over; people were ready for a fresh start, a new era, and eager to put the nightmare of disease and war behind them. Until recently, the 1918 flu was largely forgotten. Other flu pandemics followed, none so bad but all nonetheless sobering. In the Hong Kong flu of 1968, one million people died worldwide, including 100,000 in the United States, mostly people older than 65. That virus still circulates as a seasonal flu, and its initial path of destruction — and the fear that went with it — is rarely recalled. How will Covid-19 end? Will that happen with Covid-19? One possibility, historians say, is that the coronavirus pandemic could end socially before it ends medically. People may grow so tired of the restrictions that they declare the pandemic over, even as the virus continues to smolder in the population and before a vaccine or effective treatment is found. “I think there is this sort of social psychological issue of exhaustion and frustration,” the Yale historian Naomi Rogers said. “We may be in a moment when people are just saying: ‘That’s enough. I deserve to be able to return to my regular life.’” It is happening already; in some states, governors have lifted restrictions, allowing hair salons, nail salons and gyms to reopen, in defiance of warnings by public health officials that such steps are premature. As the economic catastrophe wreaked by the lockdowns grows, more and more people may be ready to say “enough.” “There is this sort of conflict now,” Dr. Rogers said. Public health officials have a medical end in sight, but some members of the public see a social end. “Who gets to claim the end?” Dr. Rogers said. “If you push back against the notion of its ending, what are you pushing back against? What are you claiming when you say, ‘No, it is not ending.’” The challenge, Dr. Brandt said, is that there will be no sudden victory. Trying to define the end of the epidemic “will be a long and difficult process.” AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World U.S. Politics Election 2020 New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater Watching Video: Arts Living Automobiles Crossword Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services N.Y.C.

A friend’s aunt. A former classmate. The gravediggers of the city, one of the biggest in West Africa, say they are working overtime. And so many doctors and nurses have been infected with the coronavirus that few hospitals are now accepting patients. Officially, Kano has reported 753 cases and 33 deaths attributed to the virus. But in reality, the metropolis is experiencing a major, unchecked outbreak, according to doctors and public health experts. It could be one of the continent’s worst. The coronavirus has been slower to take hold in Africa than on other continents, according to the numbers released daily by the World Health Organization. But blazing hot spots are beginning to emerge. Kano is only one of several places in Africa where a relatively low official case count bears no resemblance to what health workers and residents say they are seeing on the ground. In Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, officials say that burials have tripled. In Tanzania, after cases suddenly rose and the United States Embassy issued a health alert, the Tanzanian government abruptly stopped releasing its data. Kano’s state government, until recently, claimed a spate of unusual deaths was caused not by the coronavirus, but by hypertension, diabetes, meningitis or acute malaria. There is little social distancing, and few people are being tested. “The leadership is in denial,” said Usman Yusuf, a hematology-oncology professor and the former head of Nigeria’s national health insurance agency. “It’s almost like saying there is no Covid in New York.” He said he thought a significant portion of the population was probably infected in Kano, a city with an estimated five million people (though there has been no census since 2006). Though they have now acknowledged they have a problem with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the authorities in Kano spent precious weeks denying it, despite the surge in what Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the state governor, called “mysterious deaths.” “So far, there’s been nothing to suggest that they are linked with Covid-19,” Mr. Ganduje posted on Twitter on April 27, when, according to doctors in Kano’s hospitals, the city was already firmly in the grip of a serious coronavirus outbreak. Image A mobile testing laboratory in Kano this month. Test results in Kano can take two weeks to come through. Credit...Sipa, via Associated Press There was nothing mysterious about what doctors said they were seeing at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, the city’s main public hospital. Starting well before Kano’s first case was reported on April 11, the hospital saw a steady stream of older patients with fevers, coughs, difficulty breathing and low oxygen saturation levels, many of them with underlying health conditions. Doctors at the hospital called the government’s response team. Sometimes it took 24 hours to get a call back. Sometimes, the team refused to test or isolate patients, saying they did not qualify because they had not traveled recently. About 60 to 70 percent of the elderly patients who went to the hospital and later died had arrived with full symptoms of Covid-19, said a doctor in the medical department, who, along with another doctor, spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. One doctor said the department’s death registers for April showed far more patients had died than normal. Most patients were sent home, he said, and the hospital’s staff members often would hear later that they had died. With no personal protective equipment except surgical masks, the doctors said they knew the risks they were running in treating these patients. They said that they begged the hospital management for N-95 masks, face shields, gloves and aprons, but that none came. They asked for an isolation center at the hospital, scared that patients with other ailments would be infected. They wanted the facilities fumigated. Nothing happened. And then it was too late. The doctors began to get sick. “All of us were exposed,” said the other doctor. “Ultimately, what we feared has happened.” Twenty of the 91 doctors in the hospital’s medical department tested positive, the doctors said. Overall in Kano, 42 doctors and 28 nurses have tested positive, and one doctor has died, according to Dr. Sanusi Bala, chairman of the Kano branch of the Nigerian Medical Association. Laboratory technicians in what was then Kano’s only testing laboratory got sick too, and it closed for several days. The city’s health system, already extremely limited, was crippled.

But it has been conducting far fewer tests, typically 1,000 to 1,200 daily. Test results in Kano can take two weeks. Doctors awaiting their test results cannot go to work. People in quarantine cannot leave. Image A coronavirus isolation center in Kano, funded by private donations, on April 7, before the virus surged in the city.Credit...Aminu Abubakar/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “If I say thousands of people are dying from Covid, I don’t think I exaggerated the figure,” said the doctor who begged for P.P.E. “So many people are dying without being tested, without even going to the hospital.” While the government loosened lockdowns on May 4 in the capital, Abuja, and biggest city, Lagos, it extended the one in Kano. But few people observe it. The many funerals are well attended, residents said. Many in the city think the coronavirus is a hoax, perhaps because public messaging about it is mostly in English, which most Kano residents do not speak, health experts said. Others believe that a Covid-19 diagnosis is a death sentence, the experts said, and do not want their neighbors to think they are infected. So they avoid being tested, and try to behave as if all is normal. They go to burials, and shake fellow mourners’ hands because it would be socially unacceptable not to. They shop, barefaced, in crowded markets. They hold soccer tournaments — a recent one was called the “Coronavirus Cup.” While the situation in Kano is grim, the picture varies greatly from one country in Africa to another. From the numbers gathered by the World Health Organization and other groups, Djibouti, in East Africa, looks as if it has the highest infection rate per capita on the continent, at 1 in 746 people. But public health officials interviewed there attribute that to aggressive testing and contact tracing. Anyone who tests positive is hospitalized, even if no symptoms are apparent. Tanzania has reported 509 cases, but it stopped releasing data two weeks ago, and the United States Embassy there said on Wednesday that the risk of contracting Covid-19 was “extremely high.” A government spokesman told the BBC that testing had been suspended while the authorities investigated the many testing kits, but denied that Tanzania was doing too little to stop the virus’s spread. In Somalia, more than 1,200 people have tested positive and, officially, 53 have died. But doctors, officials and humanitarian workers think these numbers are way off. Thousands of people with the virus are staying home and not getting tested, they say. Image Praying at the burial of a man suspected of having died of the coronavirus last month in Somalia.Credit...Feisal Omar/Reuters The office of the Somali prime minister, which is overseeing the response to the outbreak, has dismissed the notion of a hidden toll, saying Mogadishu has already reached its peak. Dr. Mohamed Abdi Hassan, who is leading the medical response to Covid-19 at the prime minister’s office, said that “there might be cases here and there that abruptly died and then were buried,” but that the number of instances in which people had died of the coronavirus without being tested had been exaggerated. “We have as much as possible captured the real picture.” The Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice Updated May 20, 2020 What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.? Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said. How can I protect myself while flying? If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) Is ‘Covid toe’ a symptom of the disease? There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing. Can I go to the park? Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea. How do I take my temperature? Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. Should I wear a mask? The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. What should I do if I feel sick? If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. How do I get tested? If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. How can I help? Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. In Nigeria, some say that with the outbreak in Kano so widespread, the city may already be home to a giant, unintentional experiment in herd immunity. “The disease is taking its natural course,” said Dr. Faruk Sarkinfada, a medical microbiologist who works in Kano. Eighty percent of tests conducted in the city are coming back positive, a presidential task force sent to Kano in late April told the BBC’s Hausa-language service. But since no one trusts the official reports, Kano’s citizens have come up with their own ways of gauging the toll of the virus. Nazir Adam Salih, a writer and engineer, conducted an impromptu survey of more than 100 acquaintances. Almost all said they had fever, cough and loss of smell. Almost none had gotten tested or treated. Doctors phone relatives of the dead to conduct “verbal autopsies.” By late April, the Kano state government finally admitted there was a Covid-19 problem and asked the federal government for help. Dr. Sarkinfada, the medical microbiologist, said that the federal government focused its efforts on increasing Kano’s testing capacity, and that test results were now coming in sooner. “The Kano situation has seen us through deception, denial, defiance, denunciation, disagreement and finally acceptance and action to control the disaster,” said Oyewale Tomori, a virologist who leads a Nigerian government committee on Covid-19.

Already there are reports of hundreds more people dying “mysterious deaths” in Nigeria’s northern states of Jigawa, Yobe, Sokoto and Katsina, including three emirs, or traditional Muslim rulers, and a former health minister. “If Kano falls, the whole of northern Nigeria falls. The whole of Nigeria falls,” Dr. Yusuf said. “It spreads into the whole of West Africa and the whole of Africa.” Abdi Latif Dahir contributed reporting from Nairobi, Kenya, and Simon Marks from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Upshot The World Is Still Far From Herd Immunity for Coronavirus By Nadja Popovich and Margot Sanger-KatzMay 28, 2020 856 The coronavirus still has a long way to go. That’s the message from a crop of new studies across the world that are trying to quantify how many people have been infected. Official case counts often substantially underestimate the number of coronavirus infections. But in new studies that test the population more broadly, the percentage of people who have been infected so far is still in the single digits. The numbers are a fraction of the threshold known as herd immunity, at which the virus can no longer spread widely. The precise herd immunity threshold for the novel coronavirus is not yet clear; but several experts said they believed it would be higher than 60 percent. Herd immunity estimate At least 60% of population New York CityMay 2 19.9% have antibodies May 2 LondonMay 21 17.5% have antibodies May 21 MadridMay 13 11.3% have antibodies May 13 Wuhan (returning workers)April 20 10% have antibodies April 20 BostonMay 15 9.9% have antibodies May 15 Stockholm regionMay 20 7.3% have antibodies May 20 BarcelonaMay 13 7.1% have antibodies May 13 Note: Studies represent best current estimates, but are inexact and may overestimate immunity where coronavirus infections are low. Reported dates reflect when study results were publicly released. The study from Wuhan, China, evaluated immunity only among people returning to work, not in the general population. Broader estimates from the city are unavailable. Sources: New York State; Public Health England; Carlos III Health Institute; Wu et al., Journal of Medical Virology; City of Boston; The Public Health Agency of Sweden Even in some of the hardest-hit cities in the world, the studies suggest, the vast majority of people still remain vulnerable to the virus. Some countries — notably Sweden, and briefly Britain — have experimented with limited lockdowns in an effort to build up immunity in their populations. But even in these places, recent studies indicate that no more than 7 to 17 percent of people have been infected so far. In New York City, which has had the largest coronavirus outbreak in the United States, around 20 percent of the city’s residents have been infected by the virus as of early May, according to a survey of people in grocery stores and community centers released by the governor’s office. Similar surveys are underway in China, where the coronavirus first emerged, but results have not yet been reported. A study from a single hospital in the city of Wuhan found that about 10 percent of people seeking to go back to work had been infected with the virus. Viewed together, the studies show herd immunity protection is unlikely to be reached “any time soon,” said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The herd immunity threshold for this new disease is still uncertain, but many epidemiologists believe it will be reached when between 60 percent and 80 percent of the population has been infected and develops resistance. A lower level of immunity in the population can slow the spread of a disease somewhat, but the herd immunity number represents the point where infections are substantially less likely to turn into large outbreaks. “We don’t have a good way to safely build it up, to be honest, not in the short term,” Dr. Mina said. “Unless we’re going to let the virus run rampant again — but I think society has decided that is not an approach available to us.” The new studies look for antibodies in people’s blood, proteins produced by the immune system that indicate a past infection. An advantage of this test is that it can capture people who may have been asymptomatic and didn’t know they were sick. A disadvantage is that the tests are sometimes wrong — and several studies, including a notable one in California, have been criticized for not accounting for the possibility of inaccurate results or for not representing the whole population. Studies that use these tests to examine a cross section of a population, often called serology surveys, are being undertaken around the country and the world. These studies are far from perfect, said Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington. But in aggregate, he said, they give a better sense of how far the coronavirus has truly spread — and its potential for spreading further. The herd immunity threshold may differ from place to place, depending on factors like density and social interaction, he said. But, on average, experts say it will require at least 60 percent immunity in the population. If the disease spreads more easily than is currently believed, the number could be higher. If there is a lot of variation in people’s likelihood of becoming infected when they are exposed, that could push the number down. All estimates of herd immunity assume that a past infection will protect people from becoming sick a second time. There is suggestive evidence that people do achieve immunity to the coronavirus, but it is not yet certain whether that is true in all cases; how robust the immunity may be; or how long it will last. Dr. Mina of Harvard suggested thinking about population immunity as a firebreak, slowing the spread of the disease. If you are infected with the virus and walk into a room where everyone is susceptible to it, he said, you might infect two or three other people on average. “On the other hand, if you go in and three out of four people are already immune, then on average you will infect one person or fewer in that room,” he said. That person in turn would be able to infect fewer new people, too. And that makes it much less likely that a large outbreak can bloom. Even with herd immunity, some people will still get sick. “Your own risk, if exposed, is the same,” said Gypsyamber D’Souza, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. “You just become much less likely to be exposed.” Diseases like measles and chickenpox, once very common among children, are now extremely rare in the United States because vaccines have helped build enough herd immunity to contain outbreaks. We don’t have a vaccine for the coronavirus, so getting to herd immunity without a new and more effective treatment could mean many more infections and many more deaths. If you assume that herd protection could be achieved when 60 percent of the population becomes resistant to the virus, that means New York City is only one-third of the way there. And, so far, nearly 250 of every 100,000 city residents has died. New York City still has millions of residents vulnerable to catching and spreading this disease, and tens of thousands more who are at risk of dying. “Would someone advise that people go through something like what New York went through?” said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. “There’s a lot of people who talk about this managed infection of young people, but it just feels like hubris to think you can manage this virus. It’s very hard to manage.” Infections have not been evenly distributed throughout the population, with low-income and minority communities in the United States bearing a greater burden. On Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that antibody testing showed that some neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn had double the infection rate of New York City in general. Those areas are already approaching the herd immunity threshold, when new outbreaks become less likely. But because they are not isolated from the city at large, where immunity rates are much lower, residents are still at risk. In other cities, serology surveys are showing much smaller shares of people with antibodies. The quality of these studies is somewhat varied, either because the samples weren’t random or because the tests were not accurate enough. But the range of studies shows that most places would have to see 10 or more times as many illnesses — and possibly, deaths — to reach the point where an outbreak would not be able to take off. The serology studies can also help scientists determine how deadly the virus really is. Currently, estimates for what’s called the infection fatality rate are rough. To calculate them precisely, it’s important to know how many people in a place died from the virus versus how many were infected. Official case rates, which rely on testing, undercount the true extent of infections in the population. Serology helps us see the true footprint of the outbreak. In New York City, where 20 percent of people were infected with the virus by May 2, according to antibody testing, and where more than 18,000 had died by then, the infection fatality rate appears to be around 1 percent. For comparison, the infection fatality rate for influenza is estimated at 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent. But the way the government estimates flu cases every year is less precise than using serology tests and tends to undercount the number of infections, skewing the fatality number higher. But even if the fatality rates were identical, Covid-19 would be a much more dangerous disease than influenza. It has to do with the number of people who are at risk of getting sick and dying as the disease spreads. With the flu, only about half the population is at risk of getting sick in a given flu season. Many people have some immunity already, either because they have been sick with a similar strain of flu, or because they got a flu shot that was a good match for the version of the virus they encountered that year. That number isn’t high enough to fully reach herd immunity — and the flu still circulates every year. But there are benefits to partial immunity in the population: Only a fraction of adults are at risk of catching the flu in a normal year, and they can spread it less quickly, too. That means that the number of people at risk of dying is also much lower. Covid-19, unlike influenza, is a brand-new disease. Before this year, no one in the world had any immunity to it at all. And that means that, even if infection fatality rates were similar, it has the potential to kill many more people. One percent of a large number is bigger than 1 percent of a smaller number. “There aren’t 328 million Americans who are susceptible to the flu every fall at the beginning of the flu season,” said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine. “But there are 328 million Americans who were susceptible to this when this started.” Additional research by Anna Joyce.

Upshot The World Is Still Far From Herd Immunity for Coronavirus By Nadja Popovich and Margot Sanger-KatzMay 28, 2020 856 The coronavirus still has a long way to go. That’s the message from a crop of new studies across the world that are trying to quantify how many people have been infected. Official case counts often substantially underestimate the number of coronavirus infections. But in new studies that test the population more broadly, the percentage of people who have been infected so far is still in the single digits. The numbers are a fraction of the threshold known as herd immunity, at which the virus can no longer spread widely. The precise herd immunity threshold for the novel coronavirus is not yet clear; but several experts said they believed it would be higher than 60 percent. Herd immunity estimate At least 60% of population New York CityMay 2 19.9% have antibodies May 2 LondonMay 21 17.5% have antibodies May 21 MadridMay 13 11.3% have antibodies May 13 Wuhan (returning workers)April 20 10% have antibodies April 20 BostonMay 15 9.9% have antibodies May 15 Stockholm regionMay 20 7.3% have antibodies May 20 BarcelonaMay 13 7.1% have antibodies May 13 Note: Studies represent best current estimates, but are inexact and may overestimate immunity where coronavirus infections are low. Reported dates reflect when study results were publicly released. The study from Wuhan, China, evaluated immunity only among people returning to work, not in the general population. Broader estimates from the city are unavailable. Sources: New York State; Public Health England; Carlos III Health Institute; Wu et al., Journal of Medical Virology; City of Boston; The Public Health Agency of Sweden Even in some of the hardest-hit cities in the world, the studies suggest, the vast majority of people still remain vulnerable to the virus.

Video Jens Mortensen for The New York TimesCredit By The New York Times June 3, 2020 Leer en español [Read our live updates on the Coronavirus pandemic.] We don’t really know when the novel coronavirus first began infecting people. But as we turn a page on our calendars into June, it is fair to say that Sars-Cov-2 has been with us now for a full six months. At first, it had no name or true identity. Early in January, news reports referred to strange and threatening symptoms that had sickened dozens of people in a large Chinese city with which many people in the world were probably not familiar. After half a year, that large metropolis, Wuhan, is well-known, as is the coronavirus and the illness it causes, Covid-19. In that time, many reporters and editors on the health and science desk at The New York Times have shifted our journalistic focus as we have sought to tell the story of the coronavirus pandemic. While much remains unknown and mysterious after six months, there are some things we’re pretty sure of. These are some of those insights. Here are some things we think we know about coronavirus: We’ll have to live with this for a long time. You should be wearing a mask. American public health infrastructure needs an update. Responding to the virus is extraordinarily expensive. We have a long way to go to fix virus testing. We can’t count on herd immunity to keep us healthy. The virus produces more symptoms than expected. We can worry a bit less about infection from surfaces. We can also worry less about a mutating virus. We can’t count on warm weather to defeat the virus. We’ll have to live with this for a long time. By Denise Grady Image Credit...Jens Mortensen for The New York Times Summer is almost here, states are reopening and new coronavirus cases are declining or, at least, holding steady in many parts of the United States. At least 100 scientific teams around the world are racing to develop a vaccine. That’s about it for the good news. The virus has shown no sign of going away: We will be in this pandemic era for the long haul, likely a year or more. The masks, the social distancing, the fretful hand-washing, the aching withdrawal from friends and family — those steps are still the best hope of staying well, and will be for some time to come. “This virus just may become another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program, warned last month. Some scientists think that the longer we live with the virus, the milder its effects will become, but that remains to be seen. Predictions that millions of doses of a vaccine may be available by the end of this year may be too rosy. No vaccine has ever been created that fast. The disease would be less frightening if there were a treatment that could cure it or, at least, prevent severe illness. But there is not. Remdesivir, the eagerly awaited antiviral drug? “Modest” benefit is the highest mark experts give it. Which brings us back to masks and social distancing, which have come to feel quite antisocial. If only we could go back to life the way it used to be. We cannot. Not yet. There are just enough wild cards with this disease — perfectly healthy adults and children who inexplicably become very, very sick — that no one can afford to be cavalier about catching it. About 35 percent of infected people have no symptoms at all, so if they are out and about, they could unknowingly infect other people. Enormous questions loom. Can workplaces be made safe? What about trains, subways, airplanes, school buses? How many people can work from home? When would it be safe to reopen schools? How do you get a 6-year-old with the attention span of a squirrel to socially distance? The bottom line: Wear a mask, keep your distance. When the time comes in the fall, get a flu shot, to protect yourself from one respiratory disease you can avoid and to help keep emergency rooms and urgent care from being overwhelmed. Hope for a treatment, a cure, a vaccine. Be patient. We have to pace ourselves. If there’s such a thing as a disease marathon, this is it. You should be wearing a mask. By Knvul Sheikh Image Credit...Jens Mortensen for The New York Times The debate over whether Americans should wear face masks to control coronavirus transmission has been settled. Although public health authorities gave confusing and often contradictory advice in the early months of the pandemic, most experts now agree that if everyone wears a mask, individuals protect one another. Researchers know that even simple masks can effectively stop droplets spewing from an infected wearer’s nose or mouth. In a study published in April in Nature, scientists showed that when people who are infected with influenza, rhinovirus or a mild cold-causing coronavirus wore a mask, it blocked nearly 100 percent of the viral droplets they exhaled, as well as some tiny aerosol particles. Still, mask wearing remains uneven in many parts of the United States. But governments and businesses are beginning to require, or at least recommend, that masks be worn in many public settings. There is also growing evidence that some kinds of masks may protect you from other people’s germs. High-grade N95 masks are cleared by federal public health agencies because they filter out at least 95 percent of particles that are 0.3 microns in diameter when properly worn. One study showed that N95s were able to capture over 90 percent of viral particles, even if the particles were about one-fifth the size of a coronavirus. Other studies have shown that flat, blue surgical masks block between 50 to 80 percent of particles, whereas cloth masks block 10 to 30 percent of tiny particles. “Wearing a mask is better than nothing,” said Dr. Robert Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine. Because the coronavirus typically infects people by entering their body through the mouth and nose, covering these areas can act as the first line of defense against the virus, he said. Donning a face covering is also likely to prevent you from touching your face, which is another way the coronavirus can be transmitted from contaminated surfaces to unsuspecting individuals. And when combined with hand washing and other protective measures, such as social distancing, masks help reduce the transmission of disease, Dr. Atmar said. American public health infrastructure needs an update. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. Image Credit...Jens Mortensen for The New York Times The United States knows how to fight wars. But, as the past few months have shown, the American response to pathogens can easily become a shambles — even though pathogens kill more Americans than many wars have. We have no viral Pentagon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is more of an F.B.I. for outbreak investigations than a war machine. For years — under both the Obama and Trump administrations — its leaders have had to seek clearance for almost every utterance. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the most prominent of the doctors advising the coronavirus task force, is actually the head of a research institute, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, rather than of the medical equivalent of a combat battalion. The Surgeon General is essentially an admiral without a crew. He dispenses health warnings and recommendations, but the Public Health Services Commissioned Corps, which reports to him, are only about 6,500 strong, and many members have other jobs, often at the C.D.C. Almost all the front-line troops — the contact tracers, the laboratory technicians, the epidemiologists, the staff in state and city hospitals — are paid by state and local health departments whose budgets have shriveled for years. These soldiers are led by 50 commanders, in the form of governors, and with that many in charge, it is amazing that any response moves forward. The rest of the response is in the hands of thousands of private militias — hospitals, insurers, doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians, pharmacists and so on, all of whom have individual employers. Within limits, they can do what they want. When they cannot get something they need from overseas, they are largely powerless without federal logistical help. As war does to defeated nations, pandemics expose the weaknesses of their systems. Our patchwork and uncoordinated response has produced more than 100,000 deaths; surely we can do better. “The superpowers have their priorities all wrong,” Dr. Michael Ryan, the head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program, said recently. “They spend billions on missiles and submarines, and on fighting terrorism, and pennies on viruses. You can start peace talks with your enemy. You can change your policies to lessen the threat of terrorism. But you cannot negotiate with a virus, and we know that new threats are coming along every year.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Responding to the virus is extraordinarily expensive. By Reed Abelson The federal government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars and promised to spend more than $2 trillion to address the coronavirus pandemic. Of that money, $2 billion has gone to helping companies develop new vaccines, expanding testing capacity nationwide and shoring up the economic fallout since the beginning of March. (Even more could be on the way, but how much and when is unclear.) The vast majority of this spending has been aimed at blunting the economic pain of small businesses shutting down and people losing their jobs or being furloughed. Congress also provided additional money for Medicaid and other social programs. Hospitals, community health centers and other providers have been allocated $175 billion to cover the cost of caring for patients with Covid-19 and for the visits, procedures and surgeries that were canceled because of the pandemic. In the latest bill, $25 billion was targeted for coronavirus testing. Many experts say more funding is needed, but there is ample controversy over how the money already allocated is being spent and which entities are getting funds. Various groups like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget are tracking the spending. By that organization’s calculation, roughly $1.6 trillion has already been disbursed or committed. The Federal Reserve has also provided more than $2 trillion in emergency lending, asset purchases and other activities, it said. We have a long way to go to fix virus testing. By Katie Thomas The landscape for testing looks far better than it did in the early days of the outbreak, when a botched rollout of coronavirus tests failed to detect the spread of the virus in the United States. Today, hundreds of thousands of tests a day are being conducted in the United States, and in some areas it is so widely available that public health officials have complained they do not have enough takers. In Los Angeles, where testing is free to everyone, a drive-through site at Dodgers Stadium can process 6,000 people a day. The range of tests available is also expanding. Tests that once required a health care worker to insert a swab through the nose to the back of the throat can now be done with a swipe inside the nose, or by spitting into a cup. A handful of companies now sell at-home test kits, and a test from Abbott can detect the virus in as little as five minutes. In addition to the tests that detect active infections, Americans can also get tested for antibodies to the virus, which shows whether they have ever been infected, and could help give a better picture for how widely the coronavirus has spread in communities. But despite this progress, the United States still has a long way to go. Public health experts say that anywhere from 900,000 tests to millions a day will be needed to screen hospital patients, nursing home residents and employees returning to work. And even as testing is abundant in some areas, it is still hard to come by in others. Shortages of key supplies needed to run the tests — such as swabs and chemical reagents — have persisted. The federal government has effectively delegated oversight to the states, creating a patchwork of policies and putting states in competition with one another. Even tracking the number of tests conducted has proved difficult, after the C.D.C. and several states began lumping tests for the virus as well as antibodies together, to the bafflement of epidemiologists trying to track active infections, which the antibody tests do not show. We can’t count on herd immunity to keep us healthy. By Gina Kolata The idea is simplicity itself: If enough of the population has antibodies to the novel coronavirus, the virus will hit too many dead ends to continue infecting people. That is herd immunity. That is the great hope for a vaccine. But it may not happen, even if a vaccine becomes available, as experience with flu vaccines shows. Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania noted that while vaccines eliminated measles, rubella and smallpox and almost eliminated polio in the United States, vaccines against influenza and whooping cough have not stopped outbreaks. (With some parents declining measles vaccines, the disease is coming back.) Influenza and whooping cough have spread, even after enough people in a community have been vaccinated to, in theory, stop the diseases. That’s because the antibodies that protect people against viruses infecting mucosal surfaces like the lining of the nose tend to be short-lived. Vaccines against respiratory diseases are, at best, modestly effective, agreed Dr. Arnold Monto of the University of Michigan, Since the coronavirus usually starts by infecting the respiratory system, Dr. Monto suspects that a Covid-19 vaccine would have a similar effect to a flu vaccine — it will reduce the incidence of the disease and make it less severe on average, but it will not make Covid-19 go away. He would like the virus to disappear, of course, but a vaccine that reduces the disease’s spread and severity is a lot better than nothing. “As an older person, what I want is not to end up on a respirator,” Dr. Monto said. The virus produces more symptoms than expected. By Roni Caryn Rabin Image Credit...Jens Mortensen for The New York Times Covid-19 is a viral respiratory illness. Many early descriptions of symptoms focused on patients being short of breath and eventually being placed on ventilators. But the virus does not confine its assault to the lungs, and doctors have identified a number of symptoms and syndromes associated with it. The Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice Updated June 5, 2020 How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.? The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April. Will protests set off a second viral wave of coronavirus? Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. How do we start exercising again without hurting ourselves after months of lockdown? Exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: Start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. American adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in March than they were in January. But there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. First, “start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before Covid,” says Dr. Monica Rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago. Thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “When you haven’t been exercising, you lose muscle mass.” Expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. But sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. My state is reopening. Is it safe to go out? States are reopening bit by bit. This means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface? Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. How can I protect myself while flying? If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) How do I take my temperature? Taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications. Should I wear a mask? The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. What should I do if I feel sick? If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. How do I get tested? If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. In some patients, the virus propels the immune system into overdrive, causing the lungs to fill with fluid and damaging multiple organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys and liver. The first symptoms of an infection are usually a cough and shortness of breath. But in April the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one’s sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on the fingers and toes, but few other serious symptoms. Severe disease leads to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The blood oxygen levels plummet, and patients may get supplemental oxygen or be placed on a machine, called a ventilator, to help them breathe. But even without lung impairment, the disease can cause injury to the kidneys, heart or liver. Critically ill patients are prone to developing dangerous blood clots in the legs and the lungs. In rare cases, the disease triggers ischemic strokes that block the arteries supplying blood to the brain, or brain impairments, such as altered mental status or encephalopathy. Death can result from heart failure, kidney failure, multiple organ failure, respiratory distress or shock. We can worry a bit less about infection from surfaces. By Apoorva Mandavilli Image Credit...Jens Mortensen for The New York Times The news, when it was reported, added a frightening twist to the threat from the coronavirus: A study in March in The New England Journal of Medicine found that under laboratory conditions, the virus can survive for up to three days on some surfaces, such as plastic and steel, and on cardboard for up to 24 hours. Other studies reported finding the virus on air vents in hospital rooms and on computer mice, sickbed handrails and doorknobs. Many people grew worried that by touching a surface that had been covered in droplets by an infected person, and then touching their own mouth, nose or eyes, they then would contract the virus. You should still wear a mask, avoid touching your face in public and keep washing your hands. But none of these studies tested for live virus, only for traces of its genetic material. Other scientists commenting on these studies said virus on these surfaces might degrade more quickly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said since March that contaminated surfaces are “not thought to be the main way” the virus spreads. The main driver of infection is thought to be directly inhaling droplets released when an infected person sneezes, coughs, sings or talks. The C.D.C. recently made changes to its website to make this message even more explicit. We can also worry less about a mutating virus. By Carl Zimmer In February, three experts on viruses published an editorial in a journal headlined “We Shouldn’t Worry When a Virus Mutates During Outbreaks.” But worry we did. As the coronavirus pandemic swept the planet, headlines and tweets poured forth that the new coronavirus was undergoing dangerous mutations. Many of these worries were based on a misunderstanding of what it means when a virus mutates. When an infected cell produces new viruses, it sometimes makes mistakes in copying the viral genes. Those mistakes are mutations, and it turns out that most are bad for the viruses, getting in the way of their ability to hijack our cells. The viruses that do manage to spread to new hosts have mutations, too. But those mutations often don’t have any significant effect. The alterations they bring to a virus’s genes don’t lead to any change in how the virus works. Scientists have identified harmless new mutations in different lineages of the new coronavirus. These lineages are not dangerous new strains. Some of these lineages have come to be the most common version of the coronavirus in some countries. Again, that doesn’t mean that they’ve got some evolutionary edge. There’s a very common phenomenon in nature called the founder effect: Whatever mutations happen to be common in the founders of a new population will end up common in their descendants. It is possible for viruses to gain mutations that do affect the way they work. The new coronavirus will be no different. But the only way to know if a new mutation is significant or not is to carry out research. It will take a lot of evidence to reject the more likely hypothesis: that a new mutation has no importance at all. Fortunately, it doesn’t look like coronaviruses will be picking up these new mutations very quickly. Compared with other viruses, scientists have found, the new coronavirus has a relatively slow rate of new mutations. That’s a big relief for vaccine makers. Influenza viruses mutate so quickly that people need to get a new flu shot each year to stay protected. H.I.V. has so much genetic diversity that an effective vaccine against it has yet to be found. The new coronavirus poses immense challenges to vaccine makers, but most of them have to do with manufacturing billions of doses in a matter of months. We have enough worries when it comes to Covid-19; no need to add needless ones to the list. We can’t count on warm weather to defeat the virus. By James Gorman Image Credit...Jens Mortensen for The New York Times The hot and humid weather of summer will not stop the pandemic. More sunlight and humidity may slow down its spread, but we probably won’t know by how much. Other factors, like reduced travel, increased personal distance, closed schools, canceled gatherings and mask-wearing, have effects that would outweigh the influence of the weather. A few things are known about conditions that do or do not favor the virus. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight help destroy the virus on surfaces and some studies have shown a small effect from humidity. It seems to last longest on hard surfaces like plastic and metal. It won’t survive in pool or lake or seawater. Wind disperses it. Risk of transmission is lower outdoors than indoors. A wooden bench under a bright sun at a breezy beach is a better bet than a metal and plastic recliner on the shady side of the pool. But if someone infected sits near you and coughs, or talks a lot or sings, it doesn’t really matter where you’re sitting and how nice a day it is. “The virus doesn’t need favorable conditions,” said Peter Juni, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. It has a world population with no immunity waiting to be infected. Bring on the sun; the novel coronavirus will survive. Air conditioning may blow the virus right to your restaurant table. On Memorial Day, many people in the United States gathered in congenial closeness in lovely weather without masks. If any of them were infected and breathing, they probably infected someone else. The same will be true on July 4. Even if the weather is glorious.

Upshot The World Is Still Far From Herd Immunity for Coronavirus By Nadja Popovich and Margot Sanger-KatzMay 28, 2020 887 The coronavirus still has a long way to go. That’s the message from a crop of new studies across the world that are trying to quantify how many people have been infected. Official case counts often substantially underestimate the number of coronavirus infections. But in new studies that test the population more broadly, the percentage of people who have been infected so far is still in the single digits. The numbers are a fraction of the threshold known as herd immunity, at which the virus can no longer spread widely. The precise herd immunity threshold for the novel coronavirus is not yet clear; but several experts said they believed it would be higher than 60 percent. Herd immunity estimate At least 60% of population New York CityMay 2 19.9% have antibodies May 2 LondonMay 21 17.5% have antibodies May 21 MadridMay 13 11.3% have antibodies May 13 Wuhan (returning workers)April 20 10% have antibodies April 20 BostonMay 15 9.9% have antibodies May 15 Stockholm regionMay 20 7.3% have antibodies May 20 BarcelonaMay 13 7.1% have antibodies May 13 Note: Studies represent best current estimates, but are inexact and may overestimate immunity where coronavirus infections are low. Reported dates reflect when study results were publicly released. The study from Wuhan, China, evaluated immunity only among people returning to work, not in the general population. Broader estimates from the city are unavailable. Sources: New York State; Public Health England; Carlos III Health Institute; Wu et al., Journal of Medical Virology; City of Boston; The Public Health Agency of Sweden Even in some of the hardest-hit cities in the world, the studies suggest, the vast majority of people still remain vulnerable to the virus. Some countries — notably Sweden, and briefly Britain — have experimented with limited lockdowns in an effort to build up immunity in their populations. But even in these places, recent studies indicate that no more than 7 to 17 percent of people have been infected so far. In New York City, which has had the largest coronavirus outbreak in the United States, around 20 percent of the city’s residents have been infected by the virus as of early May, according to a survey of people in grocery stores and community centers released by the governor’s office. Similar surveys are underway in China, where the coronavirus first emerged, but results have not yet been reported. A study from a single hospital in the city of Wuhan found that about 10 percent of people seeking to go back to work had been infected with the virus. Viewed together, the studies show herd immunity protection is unlikely to be reached “any time soon,” said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The herd immunity threshold for this new disease is still uncertain, but many epidemiologists believe it will be reached when between 60 percent and 80 percent of the population has been infected and develops resistance. A lower level of immunity in the population can slow the spread of a disease somewhat, but the herd immunity number represents the point where infections are substantially less likely to turn into large outbreaks. “We don’t have a good way to safely build it up, to be honest, not in the short term,” Dr. Mina said. “Unless we’re going to let the virus run rampant again — but I think society has decided that is not an approach available to us.” The new studies look for antibodies in people’s blood, proteins produced by the immune system that indicate a past infection. An advantage of this test is that it can capture people who may have been asymptomatic and didn’t know they were sick. A disadvantage is that the tests are sometimes wrong — and several studies, including a notable one in California, have been criticized for not accounting for the possibility of inaccurate results or for not representing the whole population. Studies that use these tests to examine a cross section of a population, often called serology surveys, are being undertaken around the country and the world. These studies are far from perfect, said Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington. But in aggregate, he said, they give a better sense of how far the coronavirus has truly spread — and its potential for spreading further. The herd immunity threshold may differ from place to place, depending on factors like density and social interaction, he said. But, on average, experts say it will require at least 60 percent immunity in the population. If the disease spreads more easily than is currently believed, the number could be higher. If there is a lot of variation in people’s likelihood of becoming infected when they are exposed, that could push the number down. All estimates of herd immunity assume that a past infection will protect people from becoming sick a second time. There is suggestive evidence that people do achieve immunity to the coronavirus, but it is not yet certain whether that is true in all cases; how robust the immunity may be; or how long it will last. Dr. Mina of Harvard suggested thinking about population immunity as a firebreak, slowing the spread of the disease. If you are infected with the virus and walk into a room where everyone is susceptible to it, he said, you might infect two or three other people on average. “On the other hand, if you go in and three out of four people are already immune, then on average you will infect one person or fewer in that room,” he said. That person in turn would be able to infect fewer new people, too. And that makes it much less likely that a large outbreak can bloom. Even with herd immunity, some people will still get sick. “Your own risk, if exposed, is the same,” said Gypsyamber D’Souza, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. “You just become much less likely to be exposed.” Diseases like measles and chickenpox, once very common among children, are now extremely rare in the United States because vaccines have helped build enough herd immunity to contain outbreaks. We don’t have a vaccine for the coronavirus, so getting to herd immunity without a new and more effective treatment could mean many more infections and many more deaths. If you assume that herd protection could be achieved when 60 percent of the population becomes resistant to the virus, that means New York City is only one-third of the way there. And, so far, nearly 250 of every 100,000 city residents has died. New York City still has millions of residents vulnerable to catching and spreading this disease, and tens of thousands more who are at risk of dying. “Would someone advise that people go through something like what New York went through?” said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. “There’s a lot of people who talk about this managed infection of young people, but it just feels like hubris to think you can manage this virus. It’s very hard to manage.” Infections have not been evenly distributed throughout the population, with low-income and minority communities in the United States bearing a greater burden. On Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that antibody testing showed that some neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn had double the infection rate of New York City in general. Those areas are already approaching the herd immunity threshold, when new outbreaks become less likely. But because they are not isolated from the city at large, where immunity rates are much lower, residents are still at risk. In other cities, serology surveys are showing much smaller shares of people with antibodies. The quality of these studies is somewhat varied, either because the samples weren’t random or because the tests were not accurate enough. But the range of studies shows that most places would have to see 10 or more times as many illnesses — and possibly, deaths — to reach the point where an outbreak would not be able to take off. The serology studies can also help scientists determine how deadly the virus really is. Currently, estimates for what’s called the infection fatality rate are rough. To calculate them precisely, it’s important to know how many people in a place died from the virus versus how many were infected. Official case rates, which rely on testing, undercount the true extent of infections in the population. Serology helps us see the true footprint of the outbreak. In New York City, where 20 percent of people were infected with the virus by May 2, according to antibody testing, and where more than 18,000 had died by then, the infection fatality rate appears to be around 1 percent. For comparison, the infection fatality rate for influenza is estimated at 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent. But the way the government estimates flu cases every year is less precise than using serology tests and tends to undercount the number of infections, skewing the fatality number higher. But even if the fatality rates were identical, Covid-19 would be a much more dangerous disease than influenza. It has to do with the number of people who are at risk of getting sick and dying as the disease spreads. With the flu, only about half the population is at risk of getting sick in a given flu season. Many people have some immunity already, either because they have been sick with a similar strain of flu, or because they got a flu shot that was a good match for the version of the virus they encountered that year. That number isn’t high enough to fully reach herd immunity — and the flu still circulates every year. But there are benefits to partial immunity in the population: Only a fraction of adults are at risk of catching the flu in a normal year, and they can spread it less quickly, too. That means that the number of people at risk of dying is also much lower. Covid-19, unlike influenza, is a brand-new disease. Before this year, no one in the world had any immunity to it at all. And that means that, even if infection fatality rates were similar, it has the potential to kill many more people. One percent of a large number is bigger than 1 percent of a smaller number. “There aren’t 328 million Americans who are susceptible to the flu every fall at the beginning of the flu season,” said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine. “But there are 328 million Americans who were susceptible to this when this started.” Additional research by Anna Joyce.

June 9, 2020 109 A discussion moderated by Siddhartha Mukherjee. Photo illustration by Mike McQuade Can a Vaccine for Covid-19 Be Developed in Record Time? A discussion moderated by Siddhartha Mukherjee. June 9, 2020 SHARE In the history of medicine, rarely has a vaccine been developed in less than five years. Among the fastest to be developed was the current mumps vaccine, which was isolated from the throat washings of a child named Jeryl Lynn in 1963. Over the next months, the virus was systematically “weakened” in the lab by her father, a biomedical scientist named Maurice Hilleman. Such a weakened or attenuated virus stimulates an immune response but does not cause the disease; the immune response protects against future infections with the actual virus. Human trials were carried out over the next two years, and the vaccine was licensed by Merck in December 1967. Antiviral drugs, too, have generally taken decades to develop; effective combinations of them take even longer. The first cases of AIDS were described in the early 1980s; it took more than a decade to develop and validate the highly effective triple drug cocktails that are now the mainstay of therapy. We are still continuing to develop new classes of medicines against H.I.V., and notably, there is no vaccine for that disease. And yet the oft-cited target for creating a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is 12 months, 18 at the outside. Pulling that off is arguably the most important scientific undertaking in generations. The Times assembled (virtually, of course) a round table to help us understand the maddening complexity of the challenge and the extraordinary collaboration it has already inspired. The group included a virologist; a vaccine scientist; an immunologist and oncologist; a biotech scientist and inventor; and a former head of the Food and Drug Administration. The Panelists Siddhartha Mukherjee is an associate professor of medicine at Columbia University and a cancer physician and researcher. He is the author of “The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer,” which was the winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in general nonfiction, and “The Gene: An Intimate History.” He was recently appointed to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s blue-ribbon commission to reimagine New York. Dan Barouch is the director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Margaret (Peggy) Hamburg is the foreign secretary of the National Academy of Medicine. She was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 2009 to 2015. Susan R. Weiss is a professor and vice-chairwoman of the Department of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-director of the Penn Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens. George Yancopoulos is co-founder, president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron. Photo illustration by Mike McQuade What It Takes to Find a Vaccine George Yancopoulos: Most people don’t realize that successfully inventing and developing any new drug or vaccine is quantifiably among the hardest things that human beings try to do. This is reflected in the numbers. Although there are thousands of major medical institutions and thousands of biotech and biopharma companies that collectively involve millions of researchers and hundreds of billions of dollars invested per year — and all are working on new vaccines and medicines — the vast majority of efforts fail, with the F.D.A. only approving 20 to 50 new medicines a year. And each of the rare success stories usually occurs over many years, often a decade or two. Peggy Hamburg: So with Covid-19, we are moving at record speed, in terms of the history of vaccine development. Siddhartha Mukherjee: Can you put a number down for how quickly we can get an effective vaccine developed? Is the 12-to-18-month time frame we’ve been hearing realistic? Dan Barouch: The hope is that it will be within a year, but that is not in any way guaranteed. That projection will be refined as time goes on — and a year assumes that everything goes smoothly from this point forward. That’s never been done before. And safety cannot be compromised. Hamburg: Realistically, the 12 to 18 months that most people have been saying would be a pretty good marker but still optimistic. Susan R. Weiss: I’d agree. Mukherjee: To think about whether there’s any way to make this process go faster, let’s start by talking about how the search for a vaccine usually happens. Dan, what is the general principle of what a vaccine is and how it works? Barouch: The goal of a vaccine is to raise an immune response against a virus or a bacterium. Later, when a vaccinated person is exposed to the actual virus or bacterium, the immune system will then block or rapidly control the pathogen so that the person doesn’t get sick. The immune cells that make antibodies are called B cells. Once they’ve been triggered by a vaccine to raise an immune response, some of these B cells can last for years and are always standing ready to make antibodies against the pathogen when it is encountered, thereby protecting against the disease for a prolonged period of time. Hamburg: Under normal conditions, drug-and-vaccine development begins with “preclinical” work — basic science — to identify the nature of the disease in question. Weiss: In virology labs like mine, we try to identify the viral proteins that a vaccine might target, usually the protein that recognizes and attaches to the host-cell receptor. All coronaviruses have a so-called spike protein, which is what gives the virus its corona-like morphology, the “crownlike shape,” as can be visualized in an electron microscope. To invade a cell, the spike protein attaches to a receptor — another protein, usually — on the cell’s outer membrane. This eventually results in the genetic material of the virus, in this case, an RNA protein complex, being internalized in the cell. And once that happens, replication can begin and a person can get sick. If you can identify the viral protein that interacts with the cellular receptor, then you can try to create a vaccine. This spike protein represents a particularly attractive candidate for a vaccine, because it is a protein that most prominently sticks outside of the surface of the virus, and so it’s the part of the virus that is most visible to the immune system. Mukherjee: So what are the different approaches that you can take to finding vaccines? Barouch: A tried-and-true vaccine approach is a whole inactivated virus vaccine — that’s when you grow up the actual virus in the laboratory, for example in cells or in eggs, and then “inactivate” it with chemicals or another method to make it unable to infect cells but still able to elicit an immune response. A company in China, Sinovac Biotech, currently has an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in clinical trials. The pros are that there’s a long clinical history of multiple vaccines that have been successful in that regard, such as the inactivated polio vaccine and the inactivated flu vaccine. The cons are that there are always some safety considerations around proving that the virus has been fully inactivated. If the virus is not fully inactivated, the danger is that it might actually cause the disease. Because of those issues, many groups are working on approaches that are called gene-based vaccines. Gene-based vaccines, such as DNA vaccines and RNA vaccines, do not consist of the entire virus particle. Rather, these vaccines use just a small fraction — sometimes even just one gene — from the virus. That still leaves the question of how to get that gene into human cells. A vector-based vaccine uses a delivery vehicle — one example would be a recombinant adenovirus, a “harmless virus” carrier, like a common-cold virus — to deliver the protein into a person’s cells. For instance, you can take the spike-protein DNA from SARS-CoV-2 and “stitch” it into the DNA of the harmless cold virus using genetic-engineering techniques. The virus delivers the spike-protein DNA into cells, but it cannot replicate in cells, so it’s a safe delivery system. Still other approaches use purified proteins, such as the spike protein itself, as vaccines. Yancopoulos: This gene-based approach was used in the case of Ebola. Scientists figured out that the protein the virus used to invade human cells is one that’s called the GP protein. They were able to make a very successful vaccine. They actually stitched in the GP protein, using genetic-engineering techniques, into a benign virus. When this virus infected cells, it made the GP protein, and the body recognized that protein as “foreign” and made antibodies against it. Mukherjee: There is also the idea of ditching the “harmless” virus altogether and just using a snippet of a viral gene, by itself, as an inoculum. As soon as the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome became available in January, it became possible to design such a viral-gene snippet. Through reasons that we still don’t fully understand, the body’s own cells take up that viral gene, even without a carrier, and produce viral protein from it. Why and how cells take up this so-called naked DNA or RNA is still being worked out, but the viral protein is recognized as “foreign” because it has never been seen by the body, and the host raises antibodies against it. And because it is not carried by any virus, this kind of vaccine can be easier to manufacture initially, although scaling up the manufacture may be tough. This is the approach that Moderna is taking to try and make a vaccine. In Moderna’s case, it involves using RNA as the inoculum. But what is the track record so far of a real human vaccine for a real human disease using these genetic techniques? Barouch: Currently there are no approved DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines. Some of them have been tested in small, early-phase clinical trials, for safety and ability to induce an immune response. However, they have not previously been tested in large-scale efficacy trials or mass produced or approved for clinical use. Mukherjee: Yes, so we have to be very careful with these vaccines. The data discussed by Moderna in May would suggest that their vaccine can elicit antibodies in humans. It did so in eight patients. But whether that is protective against SARS-CoV-2, and how long the protection lasts, is an open question. More so, because elderly people need particular protection, and we need to understand how much of this vaccine, or ones like it, are eliciting long-term immunity in the elderly, where the immune system might be already somewhat attenuated in its response. Once you have a vaccine that you want to test, then you begin animal studies. What animals are coronavirus vaccines and drugs being tested on? And how do scientists know which ones to use? Weiss: An ideal animal model is one that reproduces the human disease as closely as possible — in which, for example, clinical signs resembling symptoms in humans are observed, virus replication is observed in similar organs, immune response mirrors that in humans and so on. In addition, an animal model is often used to demonstrate whether a virus can be transmitted from an infected to an uninfected animal. Scientists use animal models to understand how the virus causes disease. They are also useful to determine whether a vaccine will be successful to prevent infection or a drug will be able to reduce or eliminate the disease. With Covid-19, there’s currently a hamster model that looks like it works pretty well to mimic the disease and also some promising research with mice, ferrets and also nonhuman primates. None of these models are perfect, but each one of them tells us something about the immune response and may be useful for testing of vaccine efficacy as well as for antiviral therapies. Mukherjee: Dan, you have been working with the monkey model and a genetically engineered vaccine. Can you tell us more about it? Barouch: We’re collaborating with Johnson & Johnson in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This vaccine involves a recombinant adenovirus vector — a common-cold virus that’s been altered to make it harmless — to shuttle the spike protein into cells. That is an efficient way of inducing potent immune responses to a pathogen and elicits durable immune responses as well. There are two key scientific questions related to vaccine development that are crucial. First, is there evidence that natural immunity induced by infection protects against a subsequent encounter with the virus? And then, of course, there is the question of which vaccines to test and how effective any of these will be. We have just published some preliminary answers to these questions in the animal model in monkeys. In the first experiment, we infected nine monkeys with SARS-CoV-2 in the nose and in the lungs. All the animals developed a viral pneumonia, which was similar to human disease, except the monkey disease was mild and all animals recovered. Thirty-five days later, we re-exposed the animals a second time to the virus — and found that all the animals were protected. There was no virus or very low levels of the virus in the lungs. This is an important question because, historically, it has proved much easier to develop vaccines when there is natural protective immunity against the virus. For H.I.V., for instance, there is no natural protective immunity, and that’s part of the reason that H.I.V. vaccines have been so hard to develop. In the second study, we developed a series of prototype vaccines. These were “naked DNA” vaccines — ones without any delivery vehicles. These are not the vaccines that we are planning to take into the clinic, but rather these prototype DNA vaccines can teach us a lot about the immune responses needed to protect against this virus. We used six different versions of the spike-protein gene — some encoding the full protein, some with smaller pieces. Twenty-five monkeys received these vaccines and 10 received just saline as a control. Each monkey received two vaccine shots. Six weeks after the first shot, they were exposed to the virus, and we found that vaccinated animals were protected from SARS-CoV-2. Eight of the 25 animals had no virus detected after exposure, and the remaining animals showed low levels of the virus. Most important, the level of antibodies induced by the vaccine correlated with the level of protection, and this biomarker may therefore be useful for monitoring vaccine studies moving forward. The full-length spike protein appeared to work the best. The implications of these two studies are that both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity can exist in primates and that the amount of antibody may serve as a useful marker for vaccine effectiveness. But of course, these are animal studies, and we will need to study these questions in humans. Mukherjee: So what happens next in terms of making a real vaccine out of these data? Barouch: DNA encoding the full-length spike protein has been stitched into the common-cold virus vector as a more efficient way of transporting the spike-protein DNA into cells. That’s the basis of the vaccine we are developing with J.& J. Mukherjee: In addition to the J.& J. and Moderna vaccines, there are several other programs. One is the Oxford program. What do we know about that one? Barouch: The Oxford vaccine is based on a chimpanzee common-cold virus, and it also encodes the spike protein. Early data shows that in monkeys, the vaccine was able to reduce the amount of virus in the lung but not in the nose, following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine has already started early human testing, but we are still waiting for definitive data. Several vaccines are also in clinical trials in China, including Sinovac’s inactivated-virus vaccine and another vaccine based on a human common-cold virus. Photo illustration by Mike McQuade Getting From a Discovery to a Cure Mukherjee: Once you know the vaccine you want to test, what happens next? Barouch: Vaccine development for a new pathogen traditionally takes many years or even decades. The process includes small-scale manufacturing; Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials; and then regulatory approval and large-scale manufacturing. For SARS-CoV-2, the goal is to compress these timelines considerably without compromising safety, which is absolutely critical for any vaccine that will be given to large numbers of individuals. Hamburg: And there are a lot of hurdles that come up along the way. Sometimes developers have a good idea but can’t translate it into a viable vaccine. Or you wind up with unexpected side effects in early human studies. Worse, you can find safety or efficacy problems further along, or you find that you can’t reliably scale up manufacturing or you run into problems with regulatory authorities. Mukherjee: Walk us through what happens with human testing. Yancopoulos: The first human trials are called Phase 1 trials and consist of small “safety trials” exploring increasing doses of the drug, to prove you can get into an effective level of the drug without obvious harm. This usually takes from a few months to a year or two. If you are satisfied that the Phase 1 trial has established that an effective level of the drug does not cause obvious harm (albeit in the small number of patients in Phase 1), you then proceed in the next stage of trials, Phase 2, that further establish safety in larger patient numbers while also demonstrating that your drug has some beneficial effect. For example, Phase 2 might show that a drug lowers “bad cholesterol.” But it doesn’t necessarily mean that it prevents heart attacks. Only when you do very large, well-controlled Phase 3 studies can you prove that lowering the “bad cholesterol” also can prevent heart attacks and save lives. For example, for the heart-disease drug Praluent that my company developed, we could show that it effectively lowered “bad cholesterol” in Phase 2 trials of a couple hundred patients, but the Phase 3 trial that was required to show it prevented heart attacks and improved survival involved about 20,000 patients and about five years. Mukherjee: In what you just described, the Phase 1 alone can be up to two years. How could we accelerate the whole process? Hamburg: Well, we can’t abandon the rigor of the science. And we certainly can’t abandon the ethics of how we do studies either. But what we can do is, frankly, ask developers to take more risks themselves. Vaccine development can be costly and success uncertain. As compared to a drug that someone may take every day, the return on investment versus risk of failed development is pretty high for vaccines. Because vaccines are often viewed as a public good, protecting both people and communities, there can be considerable pressure on companies to restrict price on vaccines, so a company rarely has a “blockbuster” vaccine the way that a cancer treatment, ulcer drug or cholesterol-lowering drug can be. Also, there are liability issues because you are giving a vaccine to a healthy person to protect them from disease rather than treating an existing problem. So the trade-off of development risk and benefit often does not favor vaccines. In order to manage those risks, trials of different vaccine candidates tend to be done one step at a time. Barouch: For Covid-19, developers are talking about performing as many steps in parallel as possible, as opposed to sequentially. For example, multiple vaccine manufacturers are willing to take enormous financial risks — planning for large-scale manufacturing up front, even before knowing whether the vaccine works or not. There might be a half dozen vaccines that will get to the Phase 3 stage. How do we select which ones go forward? Do we prioritize vaccines that are similar to ones that have been tested previously in humans and that have shown safety and potency? Or do we turn to vaccines that can be mass produced quickly and safely? Ultimately, the prioritization is a complicated process that involves many decisions. The F.D.A. has to be involved, as well as governments and regulatory agencies and stakeholders around the world. There are questions about safety, efficacy, manufacturability and scalability that must be tackled. Hamburg: Obviously we’re looking for ones that work in the early trials. But we don’t just need a vaccine that works; we need one that can be reliably scaled up to manufacture in very large volumes. Ideally, it would be one that doesn’t require multiple doses to be effective, certainly not beyond, say, a two-dose regimen. And ideally it wouldn’t require refrigerated storage, so it can be made more available in resource-poor settings. So, there are characteristics of a vaccine in addition to safety and efficacy that are going to matter. Mukherjee: Are there other ways to speed up the process? Typically in Phase 3 trials, you’d go out into the field and give, say, 15,000 people the vaccine you’re testing and 15,000 people a placebo. And then you wait and see how many of those with the vaccine came down with the disease versus the numbers who were given the placebo. But of course, that takes a long time. You’d need to wait months or years to watch this natural experiment. One ethically fraught possibility that some experts have floated is the use of so-called “challenge” trials, in which young, healthy people are given a vaccine and then deliberately exposed to the virus. This would only happen once the safety of the vaccine was established and there was some hint that there is an immune response. But what are the ethical concerns about accelerating a vaccine process? Barouch: For certain pathogens, it has been considered ethical to perform human-challenge studies but typically only for pathogens for which there is a highly effective treatment. For example, for malaria there is a very widely and effectively used human-challenge model in which vaccines or other interventions can be tested. Human volunteers can be inoculated with malaria and then, if they develop the disease, can be treated rapidly so that they don’t actually get sick. Mukherjee: Why can’t we do this for Covid-19? Barouch: The dilemma for Covid-19 is that there currently is no curative therapy. So, if a volunteer in a potential human-challenge study gets severely ill, there may not be a way to cure that person. In fact, far from it: The drugs in our armamentarium are not perfect, and so we would have no guarantee that we could “rescue” a person who got severely ill. Weiss: I’m not an ethicist, but my gut feeling is that challenge trials are too dangerous. Young people can get quite sick and die from Covid-19. Mukherjee: If we could develop a drug or an antibody that would be able to mitigate the disease, we would still need to think about the ethical concerns of a human challenge. There’s also the question of who “volunteers” for such a challenge. There’s been a whole history — extremely fraught — where minorities were used as experimental subjects without their understanding or consent. How do we ensure that the volunteers understand the consent? How do we ensure that they are not given perverse incentives? A young person might believe that if they get vaccinated and challenged, then they have an “immunity passport” against the disease. But what if, in fact, they fall sick and we have no effective therapy. The question of a challenge experiment therefore requires both deep ethical thinking — who, what, how many — and scientific thinking: Is there a strategy to “rescue” a patient if the challenge resulted in a real disease. Hamburg: There’s also the question of how much a challenge trial on young healthy patients will even tell us what we need to know. If we do a study using these lowest-risk patients, will that give us adequate information about the value of the vaccine in the elderly populations, who in many ways are the most important target for this vaccine? Barouch: Absolutely. The problem for human-challenge studies, beyond the ethical questions, is that a controlled human-challenge experiment doesn’t necessarily translate to showing how a vaccine would actually perform in the real world. Participants in any such challenge studies would likely be young, healthy individuals at lowest risk, and so the data generated may not be applicable to elderly and vulnerable populations that need to be protected with a vaccine. There may also be different doses and different viral variants. Mukherjee: Peggy, is there something we should be doing while we’re waiting for all these trials? Hamburg: Well, I think we definitely need to be thinking about the scale-up and manufacturing issues, as we said already. Another issue that we need to be thinking about is working with the communities where these large-scale Phase 3 studies will be done. Some will be done in the U.S., but others will be done in other places around the world — lower-resourced places that may not have the kind of clinical-research infrastructure that we have here, whether it’s having enough trained researchers or the sophisticated health care services they need, like lab and diagnostic tools and basic things like refrigeration and cold storage. Mukherjee: So in speeding up the vaccine-development process, we have three things going for us: We have cleaner and likely safer technologies to create vaccines; we know the viral proteins that are likely to raise a good immune response; and we know how to measure that immune response with much greater accuracy in humans that have been given a test dose of the vaccine. All of these we hope will accelerate the Phase 1 safety trials — some of which have already started, between March and May — so that they can be done in four to six months. After that, we’re still looking at a roughly 12-month period to test the vaccine in real human populations, so it seems we’re pushing toward the 18-month marker. Dan, what’s your sense of the time that it will take to actually deploy the vaccine across the population of the world once we have it? Barouch: There are two timelines that matter. One is the infrastructure and timeline needed to manufacture massive numbers of doses of the vaccine, and a separate, potentially different timeline to actually deploy the vaccine. Hamburg: On the manufacturing front, you’ve probably heard about Bill Gates’s decision to begin to invest in a range of different types of manufacturing capabilities, to capture the different categories of vaccines, not knowing which of the different types of vaccine candidates are actually going to make it over the finish line. Mukherjee: Right, so that once the “winner” is identified, that winner can go forward without having to wait for capacity. Barouch: The reason to build out this capacity in advance is that different vaccines are made very differently. For example, the manufacturing process for an RNA vaccine is entirely different than for an adenovirus vector-based vaccine. For rapid deployment of a vaccine after clinical efficacy is shown, large-scale manufacturing of multiple vaccine candidates has to begin before there is demonstration of vaccine efficacy. Hamburg: But even if this initiative moves forward, I think there may be a misunderstanding in the public at large about the challenges of scale-up and manufacturing. Once a vaccine is approved, it is not going be available the next day for whoever wants it. Mukherjee: Tell us about that. That’s important. Hamburg: Manufacturing has to be done in a high-quality and consistent way. There are materials that are needed that can be in limited supply, like the vials and the stoppers that you need for packaging. And then there are chains for distribution, and sometimes vaccines have to be kept frozen at very low temperatures. So you have to have all of those important systems for manufacturing, packaging and delivery and distribution up and running and the supply chains flowing in order to actually get what might now be an approved vaccine actually into the bodies of the individuals who need it. Mukherjee: And then this returns to the distribution and inoculation of the vaccine, and epidemiological studies that follow it. Hamburg: Yes, I think we need to create systems for assuring fair and equitable and public-health-driven distribution of the vaccine as well. One concern that many have is that there’s going to be a huge nationalistic push for countries to try to get hold of as much vaccine as they can for use within their own borders, yet ultimately the safety of any country or community depends on addressing and protecting against this virus all over the world. Photo illustration by Mike McQuade What Will We Have in the Meantime? Yancopoulos: As we’ve been saying, with all the challenges regarding developing, testing, manufacturing and distributing a safe and effective vaccine — no matter how much effort so many scientists and companies put on the problem — it could still take years or even longer. This is why it’s so important to have additional efforts ongoing in parallel to try to fight back against this pandemic. If we don’t have a safe and effective vaccine for one to two years, or even longer, we need to develop other treatments as a bridge to a vaccine — to allow society to have a path toward reopening and functioning, while we await a vaccine. Mukherjee: So let’s work backward as we work frantically toward the vaccine. What can we do now that will help? How can we move from where we are — isolate, quarantine, mask, distance — toward a therapy that will bridge us to the vaccine? Yancopoulos: The world has gotten interested in the drug remdesivir, which inhibits the process of RNA replication and has been shown to be active in a lot of viruses that use these mechanisms to replicate themselves. Mukherjee: An initial study from China, published in the Lancet, showed a rather disappointing effect from remdesivir. There was a hint of clinical improvement in treated patients versus controls, but it was not statistically significant. But there were several problems with that trial. That trial enrolled patients who had the onset of symptoms from one day to 12 days, so the spectrum of disease severity was very broad. And although the study had a placebo control, it did not have a lot of patients: 236 in total, 158 in the treatment and 78 in placebo. In late May there was a study from the National Institutes of Health published in The New England Journal of Medicine that showed remdesivir might have an effect — albeit, again, a modest one — on hospitalized patients. The number of days that patients spent in hospital was reduced, and the study again hinted that there was a reduction in mortality from 11.9 percent in the placebo group to 7.1 percent in the treated group, though this was not shown to be statistically significant. But again, this was a study that involved a very broad range of patients — some with moderate lung damage and some on ventilators. Hamburg: Until there’s a vaccine, I don’t think there’s going to be one magic bullet for treating this thing, and we’re certainly not going to find that magic-bullet drug treatment in a repurposed drug pulled off the shelf. Yancopoulos: History has told us that. Repurposed drugs are usually not panaceas. Hamburg: And meanwhile, every day we are learning more about this virus, its life cycle and the complexity of how it causes disease. We initially thought of Covid-19 as a lung disease, and then realized that many of the people who became seriously ill had their disease course worsened by a hyperactive immune response. Now we realize that many other vital organs can be seriously compromised, including the kidneys, the gut and the brain, and that something about this virus is triggering a very dangerous hypercoagulability syndrome, where the blood starts clotting in dangerous ways. And there’s an apparent association of this novel coronavirus with a very serious hyperimmune syndrome in children, the so-called Kawasaki-like syndrome. I think we need to draw on our best scientific understanding and the work of virologists like Susan to identify where are the targets for intervention, for what will likely be a combination therapy that addresses different points in the life cycle of the virus and the human immune response. Mukherjee: What about using antibodies to tide us through this period? As we’ve discussed, the entire purpose of vaccines is to induce the body to make its own “protective antibodies” that bind and kill the virus. George, you have pioneered ways of making these same type of “anti-viral antibodies” outside the body, manufacturing them and purifying them and then giving them back to individuals — so these people now have antibodies against the virus. It’s like they have already been vaccinated: They now have antibodies but without needing to go through the actual vaccine step. Yancopoulos: Right. Earlier I mentioned Ebola. Over the past 10 to 20 years, we have developed a series of technologies that are designed to make antibodies against many disease targets, including viruses. These technologies were used by our scientists to develop a cocktail of three antibodies to bind and block the GP protein of Ebola — the GP protein is the Ebola equivalent of the spike protein — our so-called REGN-EB3 cocktail, and this treatment was very effective in patients already infected with Ebola, as shown by the World Health Organization in a clinical trial. And now we have used these same technologies to rapidly make an antibody cocktail — REGN-COV2 — that binds and blocks the spike protein of Covid-19. Mukherjee: Explain what that means. Yancopoulos: You can almost think of it as a temporary vaccine. Instead of waiting for a vaccine that will make the body make its own antibodies against the virus, we can make exactly those kinds of antibodies and inject them into people. Mukherjee: And how long would that take? Yancopoulos: For Ebola, we went from starting the project to being in clinical trials in just nine months. With Covid-19, we’ve cut that in almost half: We have already made thousands and thousands of these antibodies and started to grow them up and tested them for blocking the virus. And we plan to start human trials in June. We will conduct three types of trials. First, prophylaxis, in which we give REGN-COV2 to patients not yet infected but at high-risk and hopefully show we can prevent infection — much like a vaccine would hope to do but not inducing the “permanent immunity” that a vaccine can confer. Then, we will give REGN-COV2 to patients recently infected, who are asymptomatic and/or who don’t have severe disease, and see if we can rapidly “cure” them and eliminate the virus and prevent them from progressing to the severe-and-critical stage that would require hospitalization and ventilation. Then, finally, we would give the REGN-COV2 to severe-and-critical-stage patients, who are in the hospital, many on ventilators, with poor prognosis, and hopefully show we can rescue them, get them off ventilators and save their lives. Mukherjee: And how long would the antibodies last in terms of protection? Yancopoulos: We hope each injection should last at least a month, if not several months. Beyond this antibody cocktail, there are quite a few drugs that are being repurposed to see if they have potential in Covid-19. One particularly promising story that came out of China was that blocking the inflammation that seems to be causing the lung problems in Covid-19 — in particular by blocking an inflammatory factor called interleukin-6, or IL-6, that is an important driver of the inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis — might help patients with lung problems due to Covid-19. This promise was based on a small, uncontrolled but positive experience in China. We are now doing large Phase 3 trials to definitively test whether our IL-6 blocking drug — which as I said is already approved for treating the inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis — may help with the lung inflammation in Covid-19 patients who are critically ill. But if you look at either repurposed drugs like remdesivir or even the IL-6 blocking approach, those are not the sort of drugs that I think would make Dan happy, because they are just incremental. Hamburg: Or me. Yancopoulos: Or anybody. But they could provide a benefit. Every life that’s saved or every disease course that’s shortened is important. Mukherjee: But the incremental effects that you are describing may be because the trials are still being run on patients with moderate to severe disease and in particular on hospitalized patients. In virtually every infectious disease, the use of antibacterials or antivirals or even antibodies against a virus early in the course of disease is better. In terms of remdesivir, it’s possible that the drug is much more likely to be efficacious when used early than late, and in fact, the published trial from the N.I.H. has a hint of that. As we just said, thus far, the trials have generally involved a broad spectrum of patients — hospitalized patients and some of the sickest — and the benefits have been modest. But experts such as Francisco Marty, an infectious-disease doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, have argued that this was precisely the wrong population to use the drug. By the time you have lung inflammation and tissue injury, killing the virus is not enough. It’s too late; the body has turned on itself, and an antiviral drug cannot tackle the inflammation. And so a second fleet of trials is being designed to evaluate whether the drug might be more successful if given as early as possible — for instance, as soon as you have detected the virus and the oxygen level has begun to drop, particularly in high-risk patients. It would invert the paradigm: Rather than quarantine and sit at home, you would get the drug sooner rather than later. Infectious-disease doctors, such as Marty, have early evidence that this strategy works: Patients given early remdesivir recover and do not progress to the fulminant lung disease. A group of us, including Marty, are in conversations with the Gates Foundation and others to launch trials of such a strategy. And then there’s the question of combining drugs: Perhaps an antiviral drug would work even better if used in combination with antibodies. But all of this is logistically complex. All these drugs have to be given intravenously, so you have to go to an infusion center to get them. But I cannot emphasize enough the urgency of doing these early-treatment trials. It would be really a shame to give up a valuable drug in our very limited armamentarium because we couldn’t study the right patients. And the drug itself is in short supply, so every time it’s used on a patient that it would not benefit, we are losing ground. We need political support, financial support and support from Gilead, the manufacturer, to get this urgent early treatment trial done as soon as possible. Susan, what is your sense of combining two targets? Maybe a replication inhibitor along with an antibody. And I know you’ve been involved with other laboratories, testing new drugs. What is your sense of the development of these drugs? Weiss: That might turn out to be useful, but right now drugs are still being evaluated. Quite a few people are testing all kinds of F.D.A.-approved drugs and unapproved drugs against the virus. There are a lot of potential drug targets in the viral-replication cycle — that is, the enzymes that are needed to replicate the virus as well as the cellular factors needed for the virus to enter the cell. And I guess I feel like a lot of compounds may inhibit replication of the virus, especially in combination and aimed at multiple targets. But I don’t know how many of them will actually become drugs. In addition, replication inhibitors may not be enough to stop the virus after the early stages of infection, when the individual may be asymptomatic. We may need a combination of an antiviral drug to be effective early in the disease and an anti-inflammatory drug for the later “cytokine storm” phase of the disease. Mukherjee: Yes, just because a compound inhibits the virus in a petri dish, doesn’t mean that it can immediately become an antiviral drug for human use. The compound might be toxic to humans. It might be degraded into an inactive substance by the body. Its dose might be so high that it’s impossible to administer. But I do think while we’re waiting for the antibodies and the vaccines, it seems reasonable to proceed with testing thousands of drugs against the virus — called “drug screening” — so that if something does come up, we might find a drug to combine with remdesivir or with antibodies, making an anti-viral cocktail. From what I’ve been able to see, there is unusual urgency and cooperation among scientists in this effort. Hamburg: It’s remarkable, in terms of the collaboration across disciplines and research institutions and sectors and borders. There’s been more openness and sharing than I’ve seen in past crises like Ebola or Zika or H1N1. Regulatory authorities around the world are coming together in ways that are very, very important to reduce barriers and to make sure that they’re bringing the best possible science to bear on decision making, trying to identify what are the critical questions that have to be asked and answered, what kind of study designs and preclinical work is going to be necessary, so that you don’t have companies facing different regulatory authorities with different standards and requests and approaches, so that the hard questions can be more effectively addressed through bringing together the best minds, wherever they are. Weiss: I’ve never seen this before, either. Our C.D.C. permit to receive the virus, which is classified as a biosafety Level 3 agent, was approved in less than two days. We received at least two material-transfer agreements, which have to be signed by a number of institutional officials and sometimes lawyers, in a matter of hours. Both of those processes have taken much longer, sometimes weeks, in the past. This is just one sign of administrators and scientists collaborating with each other and acting extra efficiently to facilitate the science. Barouch: I’ll just echo that. From a research perspective, I have never seen such collaborative spirit, such open sharing of materials, data, protocols, thoughts and ideas among academic groups, industry groups, government groups and the clinicians on the front lines. Yancopoulos: I’ve seen unprecedented collaboration from all forces. I can get on the phone and call my counterpart, Mikael Dolsten, at Pfizer, and his first question is, “Well, what can we do to help?” Whether it’s scientists in academia, whether it’s people at biotech and pharma companies, whether it’s the doctors and health care workers who are at the epicenter at hospitals like Mount Sinai or Columbia in New York City, whether it’s the F.D.A. — we are all coming together, and things are happening at unprecedented rates because we realize that we have a common enemy.

Upshot When 511 Epidemiologists Expect to Fly, Hug and Do 18 Other Everyday Activities Again By Margot Sanger-Katz, Claire Cain Miller and Quoctrung BuiJune 8, 2020 Leer en español 1187 When will life return to normal? This is the answer of epidemiologists, as embroidered by one of them, Melissa Sharp.Eve Edelheit for The New York Times Many epidemiologists are already comfortable going to the doctor, socializing with small groups outside or bringing in mail, despite the coronavirus. But unless there’s an effective vaccine or treatment first, it will be more than a year before many say they will be willing to go to concerts, sporting events or religious services. And some may never greet people with hugs or handshakes again.

Figures are rounded. These are the personal opinions of a group of 511 epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists who were asked by The New York Times when they expect to resume 20 activities of daily life, assuming that the pandemic and the public health response to it unfold as they expect. Their answers are not guidelines for the public, and incorporate respondents’ individual life circumstances, risk tolerance and expectations about when there will be widespread testing, contact tracing, treatment and vaccination for Covid-19. They said it’s these things that will determine their actions, because the virus sets the timeline. “The answers have nothing to do with calendar time,” said Kristi McClamroch of the University at Albany. Still, as policymakers lift restrictions and protests break out nationwide over police brutality, epidemiologists must make their own decisions about what they will do, despite the uncertainty — just like everyone else. They are more likely, though, to be immersed in the data about Covid-19 and have training on the dynamics of infectious disease and how to think about risk. They mostly agreed that outdoor activities and small groups were safer than being indoors or in a crowd, and that masks would be necessary for a long time. “Fresh air, sun, socialization and a healthy activity will be just as important for my mental health as my physical well-being,” said Anala Gossai, a scientist at Flatiron Health, a health technology firm, who said she would socialize outdoors this summer. Some said they would refrain from nearly all of the 20 activities until a vaccine for the virus had been widely distributed. Others said they would wait for a vaccine to do the indoor activities on the list. “As much as I hate working at home, I think that working in a shared indoor space is the most dangerous thing we do,” said Sally Picciotto of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the 18 percent of respondents who said they expected to wait at least a year before returning to the office. The responses were collected the last week of May, before the death of George Floyd in police custody spurred protests across the country. These mass gatherings are likely to cause a rise in cases, some epidemiologists said. “There’s a risk, and it’s hitting the communities hit hardest by the pandemic, and it’s heartbreaking,” said Andrew Rowland of the University of New Mexico. For some of the activities, there was significant disagreement. Some said hair salons were relatively safe — they aren’t usually crowded and have hygiene requirements — while others said a haircut had a high risk because of the face-to-face contact. Forty-one percent would go now or this summer, but 19 percent plan to wait at least a year. One-third said they would attend a dinner party at a friend’s home this summer (many specified outdoors with appropriate distancing), while one-fifth said they would wait more than a year, potentially until there was a vaccine. Epidemiologists say they are making decisions based on publicly available data for their region on things like infections and testing. Before choosing whether to do an activity, they might evaluate whether people are wearing masks, whether physical distancing is possible and whether there are alternative ways to do it. Because there is a chance of a second wave of infections, they say they may become less comfortable with certain activities over time, not more. Like everyone, they are also weighing practical considerations. Those who are required to go to an office or hospital every day are doing so, even if they think it would be safer to remain home. The need for child or elder care forces difficult choices. Activities that seem optional, like attending a concert, are easier to avoid. More than 70 percent of respondents said they or someone in their household was at high risk of serious illness or death from the disease. [Whether, and when, to send children back to school or day care is an issue that epidemiologists who are also parents have particularly struggled with. More about that here.] Melissa Sharp, who recently received her doctorate, will soon fly to Europe to begin a fellowship. But for now, while she is staying in Florida with family, including high-risk relatives, she has been extraordinarily careful, “cocooning” and avoiding activities that she considers less risky than flying. One of her quarantine hobbies, she said, has been epidemiology-inspired needlepoint: “It says, ‘Well, it depends,’ because that's really our slogan.” The scientists are weighing coronavirus risks against the benefits of certain activities, including emotional well-being. While both funerals and weddings carry risk by bringing together large groups of people, several said they would prioritize attending a funeral. Some are choosing to socialize or send children to camp because of benefits like mental health, education or household harmony. Dr. Sharp said she’d consider dating after a period of confinement. “I’m young and single, and a gal can only last so long in the modern world,” she said. For Robert A. Smith of the American Cancer Society, a haircut might be worth the risk: “It really is a trade-off between risky behavior and seeing yourself in the mirror with a mullet.” Sometimes, their professional expertise and personal lives are colliding. Ayaz Hyder, of Ohio State University, said he was advising his mosque on how to reopen and to conduct Friday prayers. “Balancing between public health practices and religious obligations has been very eye-opening and humbling for me as an academic,” he said. Many epidemiologists said they may never greet people the same way again. Forty-two percent of the sample said they would not hug or shake hands for more than a year, and 6 percent said they would never do either again. “The worst casualty of the epidemic,” said Eduardo Franco of McGill University in Montreal, is the “loss of human contact.” Others lamented it less: “Always hated those particular needless exchanges of pathogens and unwanted touching,” said Carl V. Phillips, who runs Epiphi Consulting. About 6,000 epidemiologists were invited to participate in the survey, which was circulated to the membership of the Society for Epidemiologic Research and to individual scientists. Some said they were uncomfortable making predictions based on time because they didn’t want to guess the timing of certain treatments or infection data. “Our concern is that your multiple choice options are based only on calendar time,” 301 epidemiologists wrote in a letter. “This limits our ability to provide our expert opinions about when we will feel safe enough to stop social distancing ourselves.” More than three-quarters of the panel said their daily work was connected with the Covid-19 pandemic in some way. Nearly three-quarters work in academia, 10 percent work in government, and the remainder work for nonprofit groups, private companies or as health care providers. Surveys of ordinary Americans show that many people without epidemiology training also think it will be months or longer before many common activities can become routine again. A recent survey from Morning Consult found that more than a quarter of Americans would not visit a shopping mall for more than six months, and around a third would not go to a gym, movie or concert. One thing the epidemiologists seemed to agree on was that even when they return to normal activities, they will do them differently for a long time, like socializing with friends outside or attending worship services online. A majority said it would be more than a year before they stopped routinely wearing a mask outside their homes. People often ask when things will return to normal, said T. Christopher Bond, an associate director at Bristol Myers Squibb. “At first I told them: ‘The world has changed and will be different for a long time. This is the crisis of our lifetime and we need to embrace it,’” he said. “But that depressed them. So now I say, ‘Well, we know more every day.’” Additional comments from epidemiologists on life and social distancing On school, camp and day care: “With a young child, I think the developmental risks outweigh the risk of getting sick with Covid.” John C. Nelson, Precision for Medicine Would do it this summer “Ideally, I'd wait until a vaccine were available, but the realities of working will probably mean that we will have to send them back when school reopens.” Katherine Reeves, University of Massachusetts-Amherst Would wait until fall “Willing to take more risks with this, even though it's not a low-risk activity, as it is more 'necessary' than other, lower-risk activities.” Christina Mair, University of Pittsburgh Would do it this summer “This is a dreaded question. My kids desperately need their friends and a formal learning environment, but I don't necessarily want to send them!” Alicia Zagel, Children's Minnesota Research Institute Would wait until fall “We do not understand enough about the longer-term consequences of Covid-19 infection in children.” Alicia Riley, University of California-San Francisco Would wait more than a year On sporting events, concerts and plays: “To me, this is a luxury and I can wait a long time until people can safely come together to enjoy it. That said, I can and will continue to support arts programs as if I was attending with donations.” Joseph Wagner, U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine Would wait more than a year “These are some of the highest-risk activities and probably attract more risk-embracing people. The addition of alcohol or drugs makes these activities too risky for me to consider anytime soon.” Vivian Towe, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Would wait more than a year “This is as much about feelings of social responsibility as about personal infection risk. Large-scale gatherings are a contact tracing nightmare and seem like they should be shut down until we have a really good sense of what's safe/how to screen people.” Steve Mooney, University of Washington Would wait more than a year “I would do this IF social distancing was enforced and everyone attending was required to wear a mask.” Tammie Nelson, Marion County Public Health Department Would wait until fall On hugs and handshakes: “Real epidemiologists don't shake hands. ” T. Christopher Bond, Bristol Myers Squibb Said they would never do this again “I think the handshake is dead. I would likely hug a few personal contacts in the distant future as a greeting where appropriate.” Priyanka Gogna, Queen's University Said they would never do this again “If we have a good vaccine, perhaps the first thing I'd do is more hugs.” Christina Ludema, Indiana University Would wait more than a year “I prefer to greet people with a traditional greeting either with hands in a namaskar or in the Lozi tribe's traditional greeting of clapping hands together.” Ramya Kumar, Zambart Project Would do it now On weddings and funerals: “It makes no sense to risk people's lives for a celebration. What a tragedy that would be.” Claudia A. Salinas, Eli Lilly and Company Would wait more than a year “Weddings — not until there is a vaccine. Funerals — if it was someone very close to me and the service was small, I might consider going.” Nicole Frascino, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Would wait more than a year “Depends on whose funeral. I have missed because of Covid my dad's funeral and in a way I still regret it.” Raluca Ionescu-Ittu, Analysis Group Inc. Would wait more than a year “Sharing such moments is how we get to keep our humanity. I won't refrain from being there for family and friends as long as we take extra preventive measures.” Martine El Bejjani, American University of Beirut Would do it this summer On airplanes: “Unless I have absolutely no choice, I wouldn’t travel by the airplane anytime soon.” Lilia Lukowsky, U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs Would wait more than a year “A flying tube of germs.” Chelsea Richard, South Carolina First Steps Would wait until winter “Planning all local vacations in the future.” Ellen Chang, Exponent Would wait more than a year “Precautions appear adequate.” Randall Reves, University of Colorado Would do it now “I would bring a blanket or sheet to sit on, my own food and water, multiple masks (in case one gets uncomfortable), gloves, hand sanitizer, and wipes.” Michaela George, Dominican University of Callifornia Would do it now On meetings with new people: “Life has to go on at some point. While I am not dating currently, I am a 35-year-old woman. I wouldn't want to put my personal life on hold for more than a few months when there is no end in sight for this pandemic.” Tali Elfassy, University of Miami Would do it this summer “This pandemic, dissertation and the state of online dating have really put a damper on my love life.” Kendra D. Sims, Oregon State University Would do it this summer “If I'm able to send my kids back to school in the fall, then I should be able to send myself out in the world to meet other people if necessary!” Marilyn Tseng, Cal Poly Would wait until winter “This is tough because dating seems less optional than, say, going to a play or the gym. There are biological clocks to worry about. So I could imagine this being safe now, ONLY IF you could be assured that the person has self-isolated for at least two weeks or more and both of you wore a mask and avoided physical contact, and the meet-up were outdoors.” Alicia Riley, University of California-San Francisco Would do it this summer On when to stop wearing masks: “When the coronavirus pandemic is over, and there aren't any other virulent respiratory pathogens circulating, I will consider not wearing a mask in some situations. I will probably always wear a mask on a plane from now on.” Jean Brender, Texas A&M University Would wait more than a year “Would love for it to be sooner. I freaking hate wearing masks.” Steve Mooney, University of Washington Would wait until winter “It’s hard to know when it will be the right time to stop face-covering, but given it is such a small inconvenience for notable gains, I find it hard to believe that anyone is in a hurry to end this practice.” Amy Padula, University of California-San Francisco Would wait more than a year On visiting the elderly: “It's a long time to go without hugging my mother. But she is probably at high risk.” Sally Picciotto, University of California, Berkeley Would wait more than a year “This is the most difficult one.” Clermont E. Dionne, Université Laval, Québec, Canada Would wait more than a year “While the elderly are at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19, we need to also be aware of the real risk of loneliness.” Heather Limper, Vanderbilt University Medical Center Would do it this summer “I feel most uncomfortable about this decision because it means I will have decided that the risk to them is worth it so that I can see them. ” Mercedes Carnethon, Northwestern University Would wait until spring Correction: June 9, 2020 An earlier version of this article misstated the university affiliation of Michaela George.

How Data Became One of the Most Powerful Tools to Fight an Epidemic By Steven JohnsonJune 11, 2020 66 As public-health experts have known since the 19th century, information can be the best medicine. What new data streams could help quell future outbreaks? Street disinfecting in London, 1877, a response to data collected in a new discipline that came to be known as epidemiology. John Thomson/Mary Evans Picture Library How Data Became One of the Most Powerful Tools to Fight an Epidemic As public-health experts have known since the 19th century, information can be the best medicine. What new data streams could help quell future outbreaks? By Steven Johnson June 10, 2020 SHARE The River Lea originates in the suburbs north of London, winding its way southward until it reaches the city’s East End, where it empties into the Thames near Greenwich and the Isle of Dogs. In the early 1700s, the river was connected to a network of canals that supported the growing dockyards and industrial plants in the area. By the next century, the Lea had become one of the most polluted waterways in all of Britain, deployed to flush out what used to be called the city’s “stink industries.” In June 1866, a laborer named Hedges was living with his wife on the edge of the Lea, in a neighborhood called Bromley-by-Bow. Almost nothing is known today about Hedges and his wife other than the sad facts of their demise: On June 27 of that year, both of them died of cholera. The deaths were not in themselves notable. Cholera had haunted London since its arrival in 1832, with waves of epidemics that could kill thousands in a matter of weeks. While the disease was on the decline in recent years, a handful of cholera deaths had been reported in the preceding weeks, and it was not unheard-of for two people sharing a home to die of the disease on the same day. But the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Hedges turned out to be the start of a much bigger outbreak. Within a few weeks, the working-class neighborhoods surrounding the Lea were suffering one of the worst cholera epidemics in London’s history. The newspapers delivered the same sort of morbid accounting that has obsessed us all in the age of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus: the terrifying upward trajectory of runaway growth. Twenty cholera deaths were reported in the East End the week ending July 14. The following week’s tally was 308. By August, the weekly death toll had reached almost a thousand. London had not experienced a major outbreak of cholera for 12 years. But by the second week of August, the evidence was unmistakable: The city was under siege. Then, as now, the first line of defense was data. Londoners were able to track the march of cholera across the East End in close to real time, thanks primarily to the work of one man: a doctor and statistician named William Farr. For most of the Victorian era, Farr oversaw the collection of public-health statistics in England and Wales. You could say without exaggeration that the news environment that surrounds us now is one that William Farr invented: a world where the latest numbers tracking the spread of a virus — how many intubations today? What’s the growth rate in hospitalizations? — have become the single most important data stream available, rendering the old metrics of stock tickers or political polls mere afterthoughts. In 1866, Farr had become a convert to a theory of cholera first proposed by the London doctor John Snow more than a decade before — the idea, which turned out to be true, that the disease was being transmitted in drinking water. And so as the deaths began to mount in the East End, Farr immediately began investigating the water sources in the neighborhood. By the mid-1860s, a significant portion of working-class communities were receiving their water through private companies that ran the pipes to specific addresses, much as cable companies do today. Farr decided to sort the population that had died in the recent outbreak not by residence but by the company that supplied their drinking water. The data he assembled revealed a clear pattern: An overwhelming number of people who became ill drank out of East London Waterworks Company pipes. The company claimed that their water had been effectively filtered at their new covered reservoirs. But investigators soon tracked down the source of contamination: The water in one East London company reservoir had not been properly isolated from the nearby River Lea. Looking through the mortality reports from earlier in the summer, the investigators discovered the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Hedges, who lived near the reservoir. An examination of their residence revealed that their toilet was expelling waste directly into the river, thereby introducing cholera bacteria into the water supply and triggering the outbreak. It was a brilliant piece of detective work, carried out with remarkable speed and efficiency. And it turned out to be a momentous one: 1866 marked the last significant cholera outbreak in the history of London. Farr was among the first to think systematically about how data on outbreaks, their distribution in space and over time, could be used to curb them as they unfolded — and to minimize future ones. The field he helped invent has come to be called epidemiology, but in its infancy it was known by another name: vital statistics. (“Vital” as in vita, Latin for life.) The innovations in this field do not look like our traditional model of medical breakthroughs: They are not packaged in the form of miracle drugs or new imaging technologies. At their core, they are simply new ways of counting, new ways of discerning patterns. At this stage of the coronavirus pandemic, we find ourselves in a situation not all that different from the Victorians, despite the vast gulf in scientific, technological and medical expertise that separates us from them. We lack vaccines to protect the uninfected; no drug has yet emerged to cure Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Our main protection right now is the one that Farr began building almost two centuries ago: the collection and analysis of data. Data lets us see where the disease is spreading and where health care systems are likely to be overrun. It allows us to calculate infection rates and map hot spots down to the level of ZIP codes. Eventually, medicine will protect us from SARS-CoV-2, but for the time being, vital statistics are the best defense we have. In the spirit of William Farr, multiple new experiments in data gathering and analysis have sprung up during the pandemic, experiments that might save thousands of lives before the crisis is over. And they may well prevent future pandemics from developing in the first place. William Farr in 1865. It is only “when crystallized by the intellect,” he wrote, that facts “constitute the eternal truths of science.” Ernest Edward/National Portrait Gallery, London Born in 1807 into a rural family of little means, William Farr was a precocious learner who attracted the support of a wealthy patron and mentors as a teenager, apprenticing with a local physician before studying medicine in Paris and at University College London. By his mid-20s, Farr had established a medical practice in London. But his true passion was for vital statistics: He was an early member of the London Statistical Society and came to believe that understanding macropatterns in mortality could become a lifesaving tool as effective as any traditional medical intervention. In fact, given the sorry state of medicine in the 1830s, data was by far the more powerful instrument. The use of data to understand patterns of life and death had been almost exclusively a commercial interest during the 18th century, a science developed largely for the mercenary aims of insurance companies. But Farr and a handful of his peers saw the potential of vital statistics as a tool for reform, a means of diagnosing the ills of society and shining light on its inequalities. After publishing a few papers in The Lancet analyzing medical data, Farr was hired in 1837 as a “compiler of abstracts” at the General Register Office, a new government body tasked with tracking births and deaths in England and Wales. At Farr’s encouragement, the G.R.O. began recording a much wider range of data in its mortality reports, including cause of death, occupation and age. At the G.R.O., where he worked for nearly his entire career, Farr was responsible for taking raw data and making it meaningful: discovering interesting trends in the numbers, comparing health outcomes for different subgroups in the population, inventing new forms of visualization. His statistical inquiries would at times take him to some disturbing positions. He spent years developing a bizarre theory about the connection between topographic elevation and disease, which led to some xenophobic ideas about the inferiority of lowland peoples. But the enduring legacy of Farr’s vital statistics turned out to be an egalitarian one: exposing inequalities of health outcomes, using scientific thinking to dispel the longstanding assumption, prevalent among the ruling class, of a causal link between disease and moral turpitude in low-income communities. Counting the dead itself was not a new technique: London parish clerks had been publishing weekly “bills of mortality” since the Elizabethan era. But Farr devised new ways to make that information useful. Collecting and publishing data was not merely a matter of reporting the facts but instead a more subtle, exploratory art: testing and challenging hypotheses, building explanatory models. As Farr wrote in an essay published the year he joined the G.R.O., “Facts, however numerous, do not constitute a science. Like innumerable grains of sand on the seashore, single facts appear isolated, useless, shapeless; it is only when compared, when arranged in their natural relations, when crystallized by the intellect, that they constitute the eternal truths of science.” The first question that Farr used statistics to answer is relevant to our present crisis as well: To what extent did urban density contribute to the death rate? Perhaps because of his own life journey — growing up in the agricultural region Shropshire, now living in the largest city on the planet — Farr decided to devote one of his first studies to the differences in health outcomes between the country and the city. Farr was a pioneer not just in collecting data but also in devising ingenious new ways of representing it. One way of measuring the health of a society is what was called in Farr’s time a “life table”: breaking down the death rate in a given population by age. (Life tables are what allowed us to see that Covid-19’s lethality has been disproportionately concentrated among the elderly, unlike the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an unusual number of young adults.) In one early report, Farr experimented with an ingenious way of representing those different outcomes, drawing upon data collected from three separate communities: metropolitan London, industrial Liverpool and rural Surrey. It was, in effect, a tale of two cities — and one countryside. Viewed as a triptych, the illustrations conveyed a clear message: Density was destiny. In Surrey, the increase of mortality after birth was a gentle slope upward, like a dune rising above a waterline. The spike in the cities, by comparison, looked more like the cliffs of Dover. That steep ascent condensed thousands of individual tragedies into one vivid and scandalous image: In Liverpool, more than half of all children born were dead before their 15th birthday. Despite those grim numbers, Farr remained hopeful that the health crisis emerging in the industrial cities could be ameliorated. “Is the excessive mortality of cities inevitable?” Farr wrote in the 1840 annual report of the G.R.O. “The first writers who established satisfactorily the high mortality of cities took a gloomy and perhaps fanatical view of the question. Cities were declared vortices of vice, misery, disease and death; they were proclaimed ‘the graves of mankind.’” And yet, he continued, “there is reason to believe that the aggregation of mankind in towns is not inevitably disastrous.” In that same report, Farr turned his attention to another puzzling pattern in the data he had collected: what he called the laws of action of epidemics, now known to epidemiologists as Farr’s Law. Analyzing a smallpox outbreak in Liverpool, Farr divided the mortality counts into 10 separate periods. “The mortality increased up to the fourth registered period; the deaths in the first were 2,513, in the second 3,289, in the third 4,242; and it will be perceived at a glance that these numbers increased very nearly at the rate of 30 percent.” But the rate of increase, he observed, “only rises to 6 percent in the next, where it remains stationary, like a projectile at the summit of the curve which it is destined to describe.” Farr’s Law was the first attempt to describe the rise and fall of contagious diseases mathematically. All the models that have shaped so much private angst and public scrutiny — the Imperial College London models that steered Prime Minister Boris Johnson away from the initial strategy of herd immunity, the University of Washington Covid-19 projections that have heavily influenced the Trump White House — all these forecasts are descendants of the laws of action that Farr originally sketched out in 1840. When we talk about flattening the curve, the curve in question was first drawn by William Farr. A “life table” illustration by Farr, published in “The Fifth Annual Report of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England,” 1843. Steven Johnson Victorian scientists would have immediately recognized many of the core categories of data assembled by epidemiologists working on Covid-19: infections, deaths, locations and so on. Today’s vital statisticians obviously have access to a wider pool of information — antibody-test results, comorbidities of victims, even different genetic strains of the virus — than Farr was able to assemble. And they have software that allows them to build models that project the epidemiological curve that Farr first identified. But the coronavirus pandemic has also revealed some crucial holes in the way we collect data during an emerging outbreak. As unlikely as it might sound, given the existence of organizations like the C.D.C. or the W.H.O., in the early days of the coronavirus’s spread, no single data repository existed where information about all the known cases could be accessed and analyzed by public-health officials and researchers. “There really has never been a successful effort to share comprehensive open data sources during any of the modern epidemics,” says Samuel V. Scarpino, who runs the Emergent Epidemics Lab at Northeastern University. “The vast majority of public-health data during epidemics are still largely organized on pen, paper, Excel and PDFs.” Scarpino was one of a handful of volunteers, including the Oxford research fellow Moritz Kraemer and a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University in Beijing named Bo Xu, who formed an ad hoc organization in late January to create a 21st-century equivalent of Farr’s mortality reports: a single open-source archive of every recorded Covid-19 case anywhere in the world. By early February, the Open Covid-19 Data Working Group had assembled detailed records for 10,000 cases. Today an informal network of hundreds of volunteers has assembled records for more than a million cases in 142 countries around the world. It may well be the single most accurate portrait of the virus’s spread through the human population in existence. Of course, the greatest value in that kind of data set lies in the clues it can give us about the future path of the disease and how that path can potentially be interrupted. But again, the work of building those models has entirely taken the form of impromptu efforts organized at a handful of academic institutions around the world. The Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers argues that the coronavirus pandemic has made it clear that one crucial innovation we need is a new kind of institution, what Rivers called a “center for epidemic forecasting.” Rivers draws an analogy to institutions like the National Weather Service. “There were a few big storms at the turn of the century with terrible loss of life and also enormous economic consequence, so there was interest at the time in figuring how to predict the weather,” Rivers explains. With meaningful investment, Rivers believes, “we can get to the place where we are with the Weather Service, where we have reliable forecasts that inform our everyday lives as the public, and also help decision makers to understand how best to respond to these outbreaks.” Forecasts are only as good as the underlying data that support them, and in the case of disease outbreaks, most of the data collection — even in comprehensive archives like the one assembled by the Open Covid-19 Data group — suffers from a crucial liability: The information is captured too late. Numbers like hospitalizations or deaths are vital statistics to be sure, but they are tracking the end stages in the path of a disease. In the case of Covid-19, by the time the average person makes it to the hospital, around 10 days have passed since their initial contact with the virus. “Public-health reporting is usually very late,” says the epidemiologist Larry Brilliant, who helped eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. “It’s just shortly before the peak of an outbreak, historically, because as people get more alarmed, they go to their doctor, and their doctor goes to the public-health official and they report it.” With a disease like Covid-19, where presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers are capable of spreading the virus, the lag in reporting can make the difference between a runaway outbreak and effective containment. A typical case of Covid-19 that ends in a death follows this timeline, which can stretch to 30 days or more: Infection -> Incubation -> Presymptomatic spread -> Symptoms and spread -> Doctor’s visit -> Hospitalization -> Intensive care -> Death In the standard regime, even in the best-case scenario, data collection doesn’t begin until Day 10, during the doctor’s visit. Covid-19 has prompted an inspiring scramble of experiments designed to move the data gathering earlier on the timeline. Some of them involve what is called “sentinel surveillance” — widespread, early-stage testing in critical populations that may be at risk. “There’s testing for the individual who needs to understand do they have this disease, do they need to isolate or seek care,” says Lorna Thorpe, director of the epidemiology division at New York University’s medical school. “But to manage the outbreak, you need to know where it is, you need to be ahead of it.” Much like the outbreak of 1866, Covid-19 has hit hardest in low-income communities, which generally have reduced access to the health care system, where most data is collected. “Oftentimes the communities that need our attention during the outbreak, that are most likely to be hit early, may also be the ones that we understand the least about,” Scarpino says. In part because of the limited supply of tests, the first few months of data about Covid-19 were almost entirely oriented toward people experiencing severe symptoms, who would show up at hospitals. But a sentinel-surveillance program could have targeted communities — like nursing homes or low-income neighborhoods — that had not yet experienced symptomatic infections, potentially detecting those outbreaks before they became unstoppable. Thorpe points to the success of the Seattle Flu Study, an initiative that began in 2019, which set up testing kiosks, analyzed samples from hospitals and distributed home nasal swabs to a broad section of the city’s population, asking them to send in samples if they developed symptoms of respiratory infection. Tellingly, the program was the first to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. The Seattle Flu Study was a variation on another emerging technique that has already played an important role in the fight against Covid-19: “syndromic surveillance.” The idea is simple: Supplement the official data from patients entering the health care system with data tracking the appearances of disease symptoms before they get to a doctor or a hospital. One influential early project that drew on this approach was a program called Google Flu Trends, introduced in 2008 as a collaboration between Google and the C.D.C. The service didn’t track symptoms directly but instead analyzed patterns in Google search queries associated with influenza: “My child has a fever,” say, or “aches and pains.” By mapping those queries geographically, the service aimed to identify influenza hot spots days or weeks before they showed up on the radar of the C.D.C. Then, in 2011, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital named John Brownstein helped create a website called Flu Near You that relied on user-submitted data tracking fever and other flu symptoms directly through a small but statistically representative group of volunteers. In the early days of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, Brownstein spun off a new version called Covid Near You. “Most people with Covid have mild illness and are unlikely to interact with any health system,” Brownstein says. “Data from self-reported symptoms can help fill in gaps, especially in light of limited testing.” A visitor to the site answers a few simple questions: What’s your ZIP code? How are you feeling? If you’re not feeling well, what are your symptoms? The data collected allows the service to map emerging hot spots before they show up in the clinics or in the official county health reports, effectively shifting the data-collection timeline five days to the left. In late March, when much of the focus was on the explosion of cases in New York City, Covid Near You was already picking up a surge in Covid-19 symptoms in less densely settled areas. “Despite the urban hot spots,” Brownstein says, they saw signs of outbreaks in rural communities, “especially in locations where people may have second homes.” New technology has also made syndromic surveillance more feasible. The San Francisco-based start-up Kinsa has been selling an internet-connected thermometer since 2014. According to Inder Singh, Kinsa’s chief executive and founder, who formerly oversaw the Clinton Foundation’s work on infectious disease, the original vision was for the company to detect these early patterns of illness without forcing people to change their usual routines. “The idea was: Let’s take an existing behavior, the only thing that people do in the home when illness strikes,” Singh explains. “They grab the thermometer.” From the consumer’s point of view, the interaction with Kinsa’s thermometer is straightforward enough, but behind the scenes the device sends anonymous, geolocated information about the results to Kinsa’s servers. That new data stream enables the company to maintain what it calls health weather maps for the entire country, with real-time data on atypical fevers reported down to the level of individual counties. Starting on March 4, 2020, Kinsa’s charts began tracking a statistically meaningful increase in the number of fevers in New York, 19 days before the city went into a full lockdown. (The first case in the city was reported on March 1.) By March 10, the number of people registering an elevated temperature in Brooklyn was 50 percent higher than normal, suggesting that the virus was already rampant throughout the five boroughs, even though the official case load was still less than 200. One limitation of our current data has to do with geography rather than time. As Marc Gourevitch, chair of the department of population health at N.Y.U.’s medical school, observes, most of our tools for mapping outbreaks aren’t granular enough. “In many cities and urban neighborhoods,” Gourevitch says, “there can be great variation within a couple of blocks, or a fraction of a mile, in terms of the conditions that really drive health. So if you want to look at variations in health and risk and outcomes, you need to take a granular view of the geography that you’re talking about if you want to be able to think about strategies of protecting at these small scales. It’s really the scale at which health is fundamentally determined: whether it’s by crowding, access to good schools, to air quality — all kinds of drivers that vary on a small scale.” By default, our health care data is generally organized geographically by county. But in a city like New York, where a single county contains millions of people, that scale is all wrong for tracking a fast-moving virus. In many cases, that wide-angle view has been established deliberately as a privacy protection. A few years ago, Gourevitch helped organize an online resource called City Health Dashboard, which presents community life-expectancy averages by census tract, showcasing the broad inequalities in health outcomes in communities living just a few blocks from one another. But even that resource was controversial. “It took years and pressure to get state authorities and the C.D.C. to contribute to the estimates of life expectancy at the census-tract level,” Gourevitch says. “That was a multiyear effort because of legitimate concerns about the privacy issue.” One potential solution that Gourevitch sees is a kind of geographic blurring for outbreak data. In John Snow’s famous map of the 1854 cholera outbreak — the one that ultimately led to the understanding that the disease was caused by contaminated water — he documented deaths at the level of individual street addresses, revealing a cluster of deaths around a widely used drinking well. But in the middle of an outbreak like Covid-19, you don’t need to be zoomed in that far to get a meaningful sense of where the outbreak is spreading. Instead of a pushpin on the map denoting an infection at a specific address, Gourevitch suggests deliberately making the targeting less precise: perhaps a city block, not a specific address. That level of granularity would be tight enough to detect the spread of the outbreak through microcommunities in the city, but not so tight that individual identities can be discerned in public data. A Farr visualization charting temperature and mortality rates in London, printed in “Report on the Mortality of Cholera in England, 1848-49.” British Library/Science Photo Library While all these forms of disease surveillance offer improvements on the basic model that Farr and Snow helped invent in the middle of the 19th century, they share one key characteristic: They are based on data assembled from human beings, as they pass either through the health care system or through some self-reporting mechanism. Shifting the timeline even further to the left may require new sources of data that are not anchored in individual cases. In the early 1990s, a Dutch microbiologist named Gertjan Medema was conducting experiments with triathletes racing in the Rhine delta. Medema and his colleagues were interested in the health impact of open-river swimming, and so as part of their experiment they collected river water, which they subsequently analyzed for the presence of a whole host of pathogens: bacteria, fecal pathogens, enteric viruses and other dangerous microbes. In those days, testing a sample for the presence of these organisms took weeks. While Medema and his team were still waiting for their results, the news broke of an unusual outbreak of polio in Streefkerk, a town six miles downriver from the testing site. Medema analyzed the river water they collected three weeks before and discovered that poliovirus was clearly detectable in the samples. The river held clues pointing to an emerging outbreak weeks before the health authorities did. “It was a lucky coincidence — if ‘luck’ is the right word to use,” Medema says now. Back in 1992, those clues were effectively useless from a public-health perspective because they took too long to decipher. But today’s tools allow scientists like Medema to detect a virus based on its precise genetic sequence in a matter of hours. Because many dangerous pathogens are expelled in human waste, sewage samples are the most direct way of surveying viral or bacterial activity in a given community — short of testing people directly. “When I saw SARS-CoV-2 hit in China,” Medema says, “I was looking for reports of fecal shedding of the virus.” Before long, evidence began circulating that some sufferers of Covid-19 experienced diarrhea. “And that’s when I said, it may be that this virus will come to our country, so we’d better prepare sewage surveillance. Not because we think it’s an important risk for transmission, but because you could use sewage to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.” On Feb. 6, Medema and his colleagues gathered sewage samples from six points in the Netherlands, including a waste-treatment plant near Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, on the premise that the virus could potentially first arrive via air travel. The results came back negative. But a month later, when the outbreak was still in its earliest stages in the Netherlands, they returned to the same locations to collect samples. This time, they found evidence of the virus in several of the locations. “If we compare our prior sewage reporting with the number of reported cases,” Medema says, “it looks likely we can pick up the signal of the virus if we are at about one in 100,000 people reported infected.” (A preliminary study of a sewage-treatment plant in New Haven, Conn., this spring showed that presence of the virus in wastewater peaked seven days before reported Covid-19 cases.) In Farr’s era, sewage was a primary cause of epidemics. But in the 21st century, sewage might well offer us important data to contain their spread. Not all pathogens are expelled in human excrement, which means that Medema’s approach has some limitations as a defense against future outbreaks. But sewage surveillance has a critical advantage over syndromic surveillance with a virus like SARS-CoV-2, which has an unusually high concentration of carriers who show no symptoms whatsoever. “The difficulty for this kind of virus is that containment doesn’t work because there is a lot of silent transmission,” Medema says. “But we can use sewage surveillance with these sorts of viruses — to pick them up and understand the virus circulation better. There’s a projection that we may see waves and waves of this virus. Maybe sewage surveillance can be an early warning to see if there’s another wave coming.” The most radical technique for shifting the data-collection timeline to the left — but the one that might offer the most significant protection against future epidemics — involves cutting people out of the equation altogether. The underlying data that allowed William Farr to draw the first epidemic curve back in 1840 was, understandably, limited to patterns of life and death in the human population. Syndromic or sewage surveillance allows us to pick up signals earlier in the cycle by detecting symptoms or fecal shedding before people make contact with the health system. But for many of the most terrifying diseases that have emerged in the past few decades, the initial human cases showed up in the middle of a much longer timeline. “Covid, SARS, MERS, swine flu, bird flu, Ebola, H.I.V., Zika all were at one point animal diseases,” Larry Brilliant says. “Instead of syndromic surveillance, going two steps to the left is surveillance of animal diseases. You move it where it belongs into the realm of the zoonotic diseases, about 50 of which have jumped species from animals to humans in the last three decades.” The promise of applying Farr’s vital statistics to the realm of animal diseases is a simple one: You can stop an emerging zoonotic disease before it makes the jump from animal to human. Animal surveillance could ward off the potential pandemic that experts have historically worried about the most: an influenza outbreak along the lines of the 1918 avian flu. “When you have 20 of your chickens die off, and your whole livelihood depends upon them,” Brilliant says, “if you have a hotline as they do in Cambodia, you can call the government and say ‘I have 20 dead chickens,’ and they’ll come and bring you 30 live ones and clean up your place. That’s a phenomenal bi-direction system that cleans up the virus for you, puts you back into business, and the epidemic is aborted. Being able to survey bats, pigs, birds — that’s going way beyond syndromic surveillance. That’s what we’re going to have to do in the age of pandemics.” Public-health data began with that most elemental form of accounting: how many people died on this day in this place. The insights that arose from the collection of that information helped turn cities from the “graves of mankind” into communities that today enjoy some of the longest life expectancies anywhere on the planet. But during an epidemic, from the perspective of vital statistics, a human death tells the story of an infection that happened in the past. A hundred dead chickens, on the other hand, could tell the story of a future infection — and maybe even stop it from emerging at all.

How Data Became One of the Most Powerful Tools to Fight an Epidemic By Steven JohnsonJune 11, 2020 70 As public-health experts have known since the 19th century, information can be the best medicine. What new data streams could help quell future outbreaks? Street disinfecting in London, 1877, a response to data collected in a new discipline that came to be known as epidemiology. John Thomson/Mary Evans Picture Library How Data Became One of the Most Powerful Tools to Fight an Epidemic As public-health experts have known since the 19th century, information can be the best medicine. What new data streams could help quell future outbreaks? By Steven Johnson June 10, 2020 SHARE The River Lea originates in the suburbs north of London, winding its way southward until it reaches the city’s East End, where it empties into the Thames near Greenwich and the Isle of Dogs. In the early 1700s, the river was connected to a network of canals that supported the growing dockyards and industrial plants in the area. By the next century, the Lea had become one of the most polluted waterways in all of Britain, deployed to flush out what used to be called the city’s “stink industries.” In June 1866, a laborer named Hedges was living with his wife on the edge of the Lea, in a neighborhood called Bromley-by-Bow. Almost nothing is known today about Hedges and his wife other than the sad facts of their demise: On June 27 of that year, both of them died of cholera. The deaths were not in themselves notable. Cholera had haunted London since its arrival in 1832, with waves of epidemics that could kill thousands in a matter of weeks. While the disease was on the decline in recent years, a handful of cholera deaths had been reported in the preceding weeks, and it was not unheard-of for two people sharing a home to die of the disease on the same day. But the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Hedges turned out to be the start of a much bigger outbreak. Within a few weeks, the working-class neighborhoods surrounding the Lea were suffering one of the worst cholera epidemics in London’s history. The newspapers delivered the same sort of morbid accounting that has obsessed us all in the age of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus: the terrifying upward trajectory of runaway growth. Twenty cholera deaths were reported in the East End the week ending July 14. The following week’s tally was 308. By August, the weekly death toll had reached almost a thousand. London had not experienced a major outbreak of cholera for 12 years. But by the second week of August, the evidence was unmistakable: The city was under siege. Then, as now, the first line of defense was data. Londoners were able to track the march of cholera across the East End in close to real time, thanks primarily to the work of one man: a doctor and statistician named William Farr. For most of the Victorian era, Farr oversaw the collection of public-health statistics in England and Wales. You could say without exaggeration that the news environment that surrounds us now is one that William Farr invented: a world where the latest numbers tracking the spread of a virus — how many intubations today? What’s the growth rate in hospitalizations? — have become the single most important data stream available, rendering the old metrics of stock tickers or political polls mere afterthoughts. In 1866, Farr had become a convert to a theory of cholera first proposed by the London doctor John Snow more than a decade before — the idea, which turned out to be true, that the disease was being transmitted in drinking water. And so as the deaths began to mount in the East End, Farr immediately began investigating the water sources in the neighborhood. By the mid-1860s, a significant portion of working-class communities were receiving their water through private companies that ran the pipes to specific addresses, much as cable companies do today. Farr decided to sort the population that had died in the recent outbreak not by residence but by the company that supplied their drinking water. The data he assembled revealed a clear pattern: An overwhelming number of people who became ill drank out of East London Waterworks Company pipes. The company claimed that their water had been effectively filtered at their new covered reservoirs. But investigators soon tracked down the source of contamination: The water in one East London company reservoir had not been properly isolated from the nearby River Lea. Looking through the mortality reports from earlier in the summer, the investigators discovered the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Hedges, who lived near the reservoir. An examination of their residence revealed that their toilet was expelling waste directly into the river, thereby introducing cholera bacteria into the water supply and triggering the outbreak. It was a brilliant piece of detective work, carried out with remarkable speed and efficiency. And it turned out to be a momentous one: 1866 marked the last significant cholera outbreak in the history of London. Farr was among the first to think systematically about how data on outbreaks, their distribution in space and over time, could be used to curb them as they unfolded — and to minimize future ones. The field he helped invent has come to be called epidemiology, but in its infancy it was known by another name: vital statistics. (“Vital” as in vita, Latin for life.) The innovations in this field do not look like our traditional model of medical breakthroughs: They are not packaged in the form of miracle drugs or new imaging technologies. At their core, they are simply new ways of counting, new ways of discerning patterns. At this stage of the coronavirus pandemic, we find ourselves in a situation not all that different from the Victorians, despite the vast gulf in scientific, technological and medical expertise that separates us from them. We lack vaccines to protect the uninfected; no drug has yet emerged to cure Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Our main protection right now is the one that Farr began building almost two centuries ago: the collection and analysis of data. Data lets us see where the disease is spreading and where health care systems are likely to be overrun. It allows us to calculate infection rates and map hot spots down to the level of ZIP codes. Eventually, medicine will protect us from SARS-CoV-2, but for the time being, vital statistics are the best defense we have. In the spirit of William Farr, multiple new experiments in data gathering and analysis have sprung up during the pandemic, experiments that might save thousands of lives before the crisis is over. And they may well prevent future pandemics from developing in the first place. William Farr in 1865. It is only “when crystallized by the intellect,” he wrote, that facts “constitute the eternal truths of science.” Ernest Edward/National Portrait Gallery, London Born in 1807 into a rural family of little means, William Farr was a precocious learner who attracted the support of a wealthy patron and mentors as a teenager, apprenticing with a local physician before studying medicine in Paris and at University College London. By his mid-20s, Farr had established a medical practice in London. But his true passion was for vital statistics: He was an early member of the London Statistical Society and came to believe that understanding macropatterns in mortality could become a lifesaving tool as effective as any traditional medical intervention. In fact, given the sorry state of medicine in the 1830s, data was by far the more powerful instrument. The use of data to understand patterns of life and death had been almost exclusively a commercial interest during the 18th century, a science developed largely for the mercenary aims of insurance companies. But Farr and a handful of his peers saw the potential of vital statistics as a tool for reform, a means of diagnosing the ills of society and shining light on its inequalities. After publishing a few papers in The Lancet analyzing medical data, Farr was hired in 1837 as a “compiler of abstracts” at the General Register Office, a new government body tasked with tracking births and deaths in England and Wales. At Farr’s encouragement, the G.R.O. began recording a much wider range of data in its mortality reports, including cause of death, occupation and age. At the G.R.O., where he worked for nearly his entire career, Farr was responsible for taking raw data and making it meaningful: discovering interesting trends in the numbers, comparing health outcomes for different subgroups in the population, inventing new forms of visualization. His statistical inquiries would at times take him to some disturbing positions. He spent years developing a bizarre theory about the connection between topographic elevation and disease, which led to some xenophobic ideas about the inferiority of lowland peoples. But the enduring legacy of Farr’s vital statistics turned out to be an egalitarian one: exposing inequalities of health outcomes, using scientific thinking to dispel the longstanding assumption, prevalent among the ruling class, of a causal link between disease and moral turpitude in low-income communities. Counting the dead itself was not a new technique: London parish clerks had been publishing weekly “bills of mortality” since the Elizabethan era. But Farr devised new ways to make that information useful. Collecting and publishing data was not merely a matter of reporting the facts but instead a more subtle, exploratory art: testing and challenging hypotheses, building explanatory models. As Farr wrote in an essay published the year he joined the G.R.O., “Facts, however numerous, do not constitute a science. Like innumerable grains of sand on the seashore, single facts appear isolated, useless, shapeless; it is only when compared, when arranged in their natural relations, when crystallized by the intellect, that they constitute the eternal truths of science.” The first question that Farr used statistics to answer is relevant to our present crisis as well: To what extent did urban density contribute to the death rate? Perhaps because of his own life journey — growing up in the agricultural region Shropshire, now living in the largest city on the planet — Farr decided to devote one of his first studies to the differences in health outcomes between the country and the city. Farr was a pioneer not just in collecting data but also in devising ingenious new ways of representing it. One way of measuring the health of a society is what was called in Farr’s time a “life table”: breaking down the death rate in a given population by age. (Life tables are what allowed us to see that Covid-19’s lethality has been disproportionately concentrated among the elderly, unlike the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an unusual number of young adults.) In one early report, Farr experimented with an ingenious way of representing those different outcomes, drawing upon data collected from three separate communities: metropolitan London, industrial Liverpool and rural Surrey. It was, in effect, a tale of two cities — and one countryside. Viewed as a triptych, the illustrations conveyed a clear message: Density was destiny. In Surrey, the increase of mortality after birth was a gentle slope upward, like a dune rising above a waterline. The spike in the cities, by comparison, looked more like the cliffs of Dover. That steep ascent condensed thousands of individual tragedies into one vivid and scandalous image: In Liverpool, more than half of all children born were dead before their 15th birthday. Despite those grim numbers, Farr remained hopeful that the health crisis emerging in the industrial cities could be ameliorated. “Is the excessive mortality of cities inevitable?” Farr wrote in the 1840 annual report of the G.R.O. “The first writers who established satisfactorily the high mortality of cities took a gloomy and perhaps fanatical view of the question. Cities were declared vortices of vice, misery, disease and death; they were proclaimed ‘the graves of mankind.’” And yet, he continued, “there is reason to believe that the aggregation of mankind in towns is not inevitably disastrous.” In that same report, Farr turned his attention to another puzzling pattern in the data he had collected: what he called the laws of action of epidemics, now known to epidemiologists as Farr’s Law. Analyzing a smallpox outbreak in Liverpool, Farr divided the mortality counts into 10 separate periods. “The mortality increased up to the fourth registered period; the deaths in the first were 2,513, in the second 3,289, in the third 4,242; and it will be perceived at a glance that these numbers increased very nearly at the rate of 30 percent.” But the rate of increase, he observed, “only rises to 6 percent in the next, where it remains stationary, like a projectile at the summit of the curve which it is destined to describe.” Farr’s Law was the first attempt to describe the rise and fall of contagious diseases mathematically. All the models that have shaped so much private angst and public scrutiny — the Imperial College London models that steered Prime Minister Boris Johnson away from the initial strategy of herd immunity, the University of Washington Covid-19 projections that have heavily influenced the Trump White House — all these forecasts are descendants of the laws of action that Farr originally sketched out in 1840. When we talk about flattening the curve, the curve in question was first drawn by William Farr. A “life table” illustration by Farr, published in “The Fifth Annual Report of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England,” 1843. Steven Johnson Victorian scientists would have immediately recognized many of the core categories of data assembled by epidemiologists working on Covid-19: infections, deaths, locations and so on. Today’s vital statisticians obviously have access to a wider pool of information — antibody-test results, comorbidities of victims, even different genetic strains of the virus — than Farr was able to assemble. And they have software that allows them to build models that project the epidemiological curve that Farr first identified. But the coronavirus pandemic has also revealed some crucial holes in the way we collect data during an emerging outbreak. As unlikely as it might sound, given the existence of organizations like the C.D.C. or the W.H.O., in the early days of the coronavirus’s spread, no single data repository existed where information about all the known cases could be accessed and analyzed by public-health officials and researchers. “There really has never been a successful effort to share comprehensive open data sources during any of the modern epidemics,” says Samuel V. Scarpino, who runs the Emergent Epidemics Lab at Northeastern University. “The vast majority of public-health data during epidemics are still largely organized on pen, paper, Excel and PDFs.” Scarpino was one of a handful of volunteers, including the Oxford research fellow Moritz Kraemer and a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University in Beijing named Bo Xu, who formed an ad hoc organization in late January to create a 21st-century equivalent of Farr’s mortality reports: a single open-source archive of every recorded Covid-19 case anywhere in the world. By early February, the Open Covid-19 Data Working Group had assembled detailed records for 10,000 cases. Today an informal network of hundreds of volunteers has assembled records for more than a million cases in 142 countries around the world. It may well be the single most accurate portrait of the virus’s spread through the human population in existence. Of course, the greatest value in that kind of data set lies in the clues it can give us about the future path of the disease and how that path can potentially be interrupted. But again, the work of building those models has entirely taken the form of impromptu efforts organized at a handful of academic institutions around the world. The Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers argues that the coronavirus pandemic has made it clear that one crucial innovation we need is a new kind of institution, what Rivers called a “center for epidemic forecasting.” Rivers draws an analogy to institutions like the National Weather Service. “There were a few big storms at the turn of the century with terrible loss of life and also enormous economic consequence, so there was interest at the time in figuring how to predict the weather,” Rivers explains. With meaningful investment, Rivers believes, “we can get to the place where we are with the Weather Service, where we have reliable forecasts that inform our everyday lives as the public, and also help decision makers to understand how best to respond to these outbreaks.” Forecasts are only as good as the underlying data that support them, and in the case of disease outbreaks, most of the data collection — even in comprehensive archives like the one assembled by the Open Covid-19 Data group — suffers from a crucial liability: The information is captured too late. Numbers like hospitalizations or deaths are vital statistics to be sure, but they are tracking the end stages in the path of a disease. In the case of Covid-19, by the time the average person makes it to the hospital, around 10 days have passed since their initial contact with the virus. “Public-health reporting is usually very late,” says the epidemiologist Larry Brilliant, who helped eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. “It’s just shortly before the peak of an outbreak, historically, because as people get more alarmed, they go to their doctor, and their doctor goes to the public-health official and they report it.” With a disease like Covid-19, where presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers are capable of spreading the virus, the lag in reporting can make the difference between a runaway outbreak and effective containment. A typical case of Covid-19 that ends in a death follows this timeline, which can stretch to 30 days or more: Infection -> Incubation -> Presymptomatic spread -> Symptoms and spread -> Doctor’s visit -> Hospitalization -> Intensive care -> Death In the standard regime, even in the best-case scenario, data collection doesn’t begin until Day 10, during the doctor’s visit. Covid-19 has prompted an inspiring scramble of experiments designed to move the data gathering earlier on the timeline. Some of them involve what is called “sentinel surveillance” — widespread, early-stage testing in critical populations that may be at risk. “There’s testing for the individual who needs to understand do they have this disease, do they need to isolate or seek care,” says Lorna Thorpe, director of the epidemiology division at New York University’s medical school. “But to manage the outbreak, you need to know where it is, you need to be ahead of it.” Much like the outbreak of 1866, Covid-19 has hit hardest in low-income communities, which generally have reduced access to the health care system, where most data is collected. “Oftentimes the communities that need our attention during the outbreak, that are most likely to be hit early, may also be the ones that we understand the least about,” Scarpino says. In part because of the limited supply of tests, the first few months of data about Covid-19 were almost entirely oriented toward people experiencing severe symptoms, who would show up at hospitals. But a sentinel-surveillance program could have targeted communities — like nursing homes or low-income neighborhoods — that had not yet experienced symptomatic infections, potentially detecting those outbreaks before they became unstoppable. Thorpe points to the success of the Seattle Flu Study, an initiative that began in 2019, which set up testing kiosks, analyzed samples from hospitals and distributed home nasal swabs to a broad section of the city’s population, asking them to send in samples if they developed symptoms of respiratory infection. Tellingly, the program was the first to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. The Seattle Flu Study was a variation on another emerging technique that has already played an important role in the fight against Covid-19: “syndromic surveillance.” The idea is simple: Supplement the official data from patients entering the health care system with data tracking the appearances of disease symptoms before they get to a doctor or a hospital. One influential early project that drew on this approach was a program called Google Flu Trends, introduced in 2008 as a collaboration between Google and the C.D.C. The service didn’t track symptoms directly but instead analyzed patterns in Google search queries associated with influenza: “My child has a fever,” say, or “aches and pains.” By mapping those queries geographically, the service aimed to identify influenza hot spots days or weeks before they showed up on the radar of the C.D.C. Then, in 2011, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital named John Brownstein helped create a website called Flu Near You that relied on user-submitted data tracking fever and other flu symptoms directly through a small but statistically representative group of volunteers. In the early days of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, Brownstein spun off a new version called Covid Near You. “Most people with Covid have mild illness and are unlikely to interact with any health system,” Brownstein says. “Data from self-reported symptoms can help fill in gaps, especially in light of limited testing.” A visitor to the site answers a few simple questions: What’s your ZIP code? How are you feeling? If you’re not feeling well, what are your symptoms? The data collected allows the service to map emerging hot spots before they show up in the clinics or in the official county health reports, effectively shifting the data-collection timeline five days to the left. In late March, when much of the focus was on the explosion of cases in New York City, Covid Near You was already picking up a surge in Covid-19 symptoms in less densely settled areas. “Despite the urban hot spots,” Brownstein says, they saw signs of outbreaks in rural communities, “especially in locations where people may have second homes.” New technology has also made syndromic surveillance more feasible. The San Francisco-based start-up Kinsa has been selling an internet-connected thermometer since 2014. According to Inder Singh, Kinsa’s chief executive and founder, who formerly oversaw the Clinton Foundation’s work on infectious disease, the original vision was for the company to detect these early patterns of illness without forcing people to change their usual routines. “The idea was: Let’s take an existing behavior, the only thing that people do in the home when illness strikes,” Singh explains. “They grab the thermometer.” From the consumer’s point of view, the interaction with Kinsa’s thermometer is straightforward enough, but behind the scenes the device sends anonymous, geolocated information about the results to Kinsa’s servers. That new data stream enables the company to maintain what it calls health weather maps for the entire country, with real-time data on atypical fevers reported down to the level of individual counties. Starting on March 4, 2020, Kinsa’s charts began tracking a statistically meaningful increase in the number of fevers in New York, 19 days before the city went into a full lockdown. (The first case in the city was reported on March 1.) By March 10, the number of people registering an elevated temperature in Brooklyn was 50 percent higher than normal, suggesting that the virus was already rampant throughout the five boroughs, even though the official case load was still less than 200. One limitation of our current data has to do with geography rather than time. As Marc Gourevitch, chair of the department of population health at N.Y.U.’s medical school, observes, most of our tools for mapping outbreaks aren’t granular enough. “In many cities and urban neighborhoods,” Gourevitch says, “there can be great variation within a couple of blocks, or a fraction of a mile, in terms of the conditions that really drive health. So if you want to look at variations in health and risk and outcomes, you need to take a granular view of the geography that you’re talking about if you want to be able to think about strategies of protecting at these small scales. It’s really the scale at which health is fundamentally determined: whether it’s by crowding, access to good schools, to air quality — all kinds of drivers that vary on a small scale.” By default, our health care data is generally organized geographically by county. But in a city like New York, where a single county contains millions of people, that scale is all wrong for tracking a fast-moving virus. In many cases, that wide-angle view has been established deliberately as a privacy protection. A few years ago, Gourevitch helped organize an online resource called City Health Dashboard, which presents community life-expectancy averages by census tract, showcasing the broad inequalities in health outcomes in communities living just a few blocks from one another. But even that resource was controversial. “It took years and pressure to get state authorities and the C.D.C. to contribute to the estimates of life expectancy at the census-tract level,” Gourevitch says. “That was a multiyear effort because of legitimate concerns about the privacy issue.” One potential solution that Gourevitch sees is a kind of geographic blurring for outbreak data. In John Snow’s famous map of the 1854 cholera outbreak — the one that ultimately led to the understanding that the disease was caused by contaminated water — he documented deaths at the level of individual street addresses, revealing a cluster of deaths around a widely used drinking well. But in the middle of an outbreak like Covid-19, you don’t need to be zoomed in that far to get a meaningful sense of where the outbreak is spreading. Instead of a pushpin on the map denoting an infection at a specific address, Gourevitch suggests deliberately making the targeting less precise: perhaps a city block, not a specific address. That level of granularity would be tight enough to detect the spread of the outbreak through microcommunities in the city, but not so tight that individual identities can be discerned in public data. A Farr visualization charting temperature and mortality rates in London, printed in “Report on the Mortality of Cholera in England, 1848-49.” British Library/Science Photo Library While all these forms of disease surveillance offer improvements on the basic model that Farr and Snow helped invent in the middle of the 19th century, they share one key characteristic: They are based on data assembled from human beings, as they pass either through the health care system or through some self-reporting mechanism. Shifting the timeline even further to the left may require new sources of data that are not anchored in individual cases. In the early 1990s, a Dutch microbiologist named Gertjan Medema was conducting experiments with triathletes racing in the Rhine delta. Medema and his colleagues were interested in the health impact of open-river swimming, and so as part of their experiment they collected river water, which they subsequently analyzed for the presence of a whole host of pathogens: bacteria, fecal pathogens, enteric viruses and other dangerous microbes. In those days, testing a sample for the presence of these organisms took weeks. While Medema and his team were still waiting for their results, the news broke of an unusual outbreak of polio in Streefkerk, a town six miles downriver from the testing site. Medema analyzed the river water they collected three weeks before and discovered that poliovirus was clearly detectable in the samples. The river held clues pointing to an emerging outbreak weeks before the health authorities did. “It was a lucky coincidence — if ‘luck’ is the right word to use,” Medema says now. Back in 1992, those clues were effectively useless from a public-health perspective because they took too long to decipher. But today’s tools allow scientists like Medema to detect a virus based on its precise genetic sequence in a matter of hours. Because many dangerous pathogens are expelled in human waste, sewage samples are the most direct way of surveying viral or bacterial activity in a given community — short of testing people directly. “When I saw SARS-CoV-2 hit in China,” Medema says, “I was looking for reports of fecal shedding of the virus.” Before long, evidence began circulating that some sufferers of Covid-19 experienced diarrhea. “And that’s when I said, it may be that this virus will come to our country, so we’d better prepare sewage surveillance. Not because we think it’s an important risk for transmission, but because you could use sewage to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.” On Feb. 6, Medema and his colleagues gathered sewage samples from six points in the Netherlands, including a waste-treatment plant near Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, on the premise that the virus could potentially first arrive via air travel. The results came back negative. But a month later, when the outbreak was still in its earliest stages in the Netherlands, they returned to the same locations to collect samples. This time, they found evidence of the virus in several of the locations. “If we compare our prior sewage reporting with the number of reported cases,” Medema says, “it looks likely we can pick up the signal of the virus if we are at about one in 100,000 people reported infected.” (A preliminary study of a sewage-treatment plant in New Haven, Conn., this spring showed that presence of the virus in wastewater peaked seven days before reported Covid-19 cases.) In Farr’s era, sewage was a primary cause of epidemics. But in the 21st century, sewage might well offer us important data to contain their spread. Not all pathogens are expelled in human excrement, which means that Medema’s approach has some limitations as a defense against future outbreaks. But sewage surveillance has a critical advantage over syndromic surveillance with a virus like SARS-CoV-2, which has an unusually high concentration of carriers who show no symptoms whatsoever. “The difficulty for this kind of virus is that containment doesn’t work because there is a lot of silent transmission,” Medema says. “But we can use sewage surveillance with these sorts of viruses — to pick them up and understand the virus circulation better. There’s a projection that we may see waves and waves of this virus. Maybe sewage surveillance can be an early warning to see if there’s another wave coming.” The most radical technique for shifting the data-collection timeline to the left — but the one that might offer the most significant protection against future epidemics — involves cutting people out of the equation altogether. The underlying data that allowed William Farr to draw the first epidemic curve back in 1840 was, understandably, limited to patterns of life and death in the human population. Syndromic or sewage surveillance allows us to pick up signals earlier in the cycle by detecting symptoms or fecal shedding before people make contact with the health system. But for many of the most terrifying diseases that have emerged in the past few decades, the initial human cases showed up in the middle of a much longer timeline. “Covid, SARS, MERS, swine flu, bird flu, Ebola, H.I.V., Zika all were at one point animal diseases,” Larry Brilliant says. “Instead of syndromic surveillance, going two steps to the left is surveillance of animal diseases. You move it where it belongs into the realm of the zoonotic diseases, about 50 of which have jumped species from animals to humans in the last three decades.” The promise of applying Farr’s vital statistics to the realm of animal diseases is a simple one: You can stop an emerging zoonotic disease before it makes the jump from animal to human. Animal surveillance could ward off the potential pandemic that experts have historically worried about the most: an influenza outbreak along the lines of the 1918 avian flu. “When you have 20 of your chickens die off, and your whole livelihood depends upon them,” Brilliant says, “if you have a hotline as they do in Cambodia, you can call the government and say ‘I have 20 dead chickens,’ and they’ll come and bring you 30 live ones and clean up your place. That’s a phenomenal bi-direction system that cleans up the virus for you, puts you back into business, and the epidemic is aborted. Being able to survey bats, pigs, birds — that’s going way beyond syndromic surveillance. That’s what we’re going to have to do in the age of pandemics.” Public-health data began with that most elemental form of accounting: how many people died on this day in this place. The insights that arose from the collection of that information helped turn cities from the “graves of mankind” into communities that today enjoy some of the longest life expectancies anywhere on the planet. But during an epidemic, from the perspective of vital statistics, a human death tells the story of an infection that happened in the past. A hundred dead chickens, on the other hand, could tell the story of a future infection — and maybe even stop it from emerging at all.

Even with more than 500,000 dead worldwide, scientists are struggling to learn how often the virus kills. Here’s why. Gravediggers at the Vila Formosa Cemetery buried victims of Covid-19 in São Paulo last month. Despite the scale of the pandemic, researchers still are uncertain how lethal the coronavirus is. Credit...Victor Moriyama for The New York Times By Donald G. McNeil Jr. July 4, 2020 Leer en español More than six months into the pandemic, the coronavirus has infected more than 11 million people worldwide, killing more than 525,000. But despite the increasing toll, scientists still do not have a definitive answer to one of the most fundamental questions about the virus: How deadly is it? A firm estimate could help governments predict how many deaths would ensue if the virus spread out of control. The figure, usually called the infection fatality rate, could tell health officials what to expect as the pandemic spreads to densely populated nations like Brazil, Nigeria and India. In even poorer countries, where lethal threats like measles and malaria are constant and where hard budget choices are routine, the number could help officials decide whether to spend more on oxygen concentrators or ventilators, or on measles shots and mosquito nets. The question became even more complex last month, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data suggesting that for every documented infection in the United States, there were 10 other cases on average that had gone unrecorded, probably because they were very mild or asymptomatic. If there are many more asymptomatic infections than once thought, then the virus may be less deadly than it has appeared. But even that calculation is a difficult one. On Thursday, after the World Health Organization held a two-day online meeting of 1,300 scientists from around the world, the agency’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said the consensus for now was that the I.F.R. is about 0.6 percent — which means that the risk of death is less than 1 percent. Although she did not note this, 0.6 percent of the world’s population is 47 million people, and 0.6 percent of the American population is 2 million people. The virus remains a major threat. At present, countries have very different case fatality rates, or C.F.R.’s, which measure deaths among patients known to have had Covid-19. In most cases, that number is highest in countries that have had the virus the longest. According to data gathered by The New York Times, China had reported 90,294 cases as of Friday and 4,634 deaths, which is a C.F.R. of 5 percent. The United States was very close to that mark. It has had 2,811,447 cases and 129,403 deaths, about 4.6 percent. Those percentages are far higher rates than the 2.5 percent death rate often ascribed to the 1918 flu pandemic. Still, it is difficult to measure fatality rates during pandemics, especially at the beginning. Latest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-07-10T21:17:07.027Z The death toll is edging up in several states, possibly ending months of declining national death totals. Other early hot spots curbed their outbreaks. But the United States is seeing record numbers of new cases. A war of words between Trump and Fauci is playing out through interviews with the news media. See more updates More live coverage: Markets In the chaos that ensues when a new virus hits a city hard, thousands of people may die and be buried without ever being tested, and certainly without them all being autopsied. It is never entirely clear how many died of the virus and how many died of heart attacks, strokes or other ills. That has happened in both New York City and in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began. Normally, once the chaos has subsided, more testing is done and more mild cases are found — and because the denominator of the fraction rises, fatality rates fall. But the results are not always consistent or predictable. Ten sizable countries, most of them in Western Europe, have tested bigger percentages of their populations than has the United States, according to Worldometer, which gathers statistics. They are Iceland, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Britain, Israel and New Zealand. But their case fatality rates vary wildly: Iceland’s is less than 1 percent, New Zealand’s and Israel’s are below 2 percent. Belgium, by comparison, is at 16 percent, and Italy and Britain at 14 percent. Both figures — the infection fatality rate and the case fatality rate — can differ quite a bit by country. So far, in most countries, about 20 percent of all confirmed Covid-19 patients become ill enough to need supplemental oxygen or even more advanced hospital care, said Dr. Janet Diaz, head of clinical care for the W.H.O.’s emergencies program. Whether those patients survive depends on a host of factors, including age, underlying illnesses and the level of medical care available. Death rates are expected to be lower in countries with younger populations and less obesity, which are often the poorest countries. Conversely, the figures should be higher in countries that lack oxygen tanks, ventilators and dialysis machines, and where many people live far from hospitals. Those are also often the poorest countries.

And now, new factors are being introduced into the equation. For example, new evidence that people with Type A blood are more likely to fall deathly ill could change risk calculations. Type A blood is relatively rare in West Africa and South Asia, and very rare among the Indigenous peoples of South America. Before this week’s meeting, the W.H.O. had no official I.F.R. estimate, Oliver Morgan, the agency’s director of health emergency information and risk assessment, said in an interview in early June. Instead, it had relied on a mix of data sent in by member countries and by academic groups, and on a meta-analysis done in May by scientists at the University of Wollongong and James Cook University in Australia. Those researchers looked at 267 studies in more than a dozen countries, and then chose the 25 they considered the most accurate, weighting them for accuracy and averaged the data. They concluded that the global I.F.R. was 0.64 percent. The C.D.C. relies on a “symptomatic case fatality ratio” that “is not necessarily equivalent to the number of reported deaths per reported cases.” The best estimate for the United States is 0.4 percent, according to a set of planning scenarios released in late May. The agency did not respond to requests to explain how it arrived at that figure, or why it was so much lower than the W.H.O.’s estimate. By comparison, 0.4 percent of the United States population is 1.3 million people. The 25 studies that the Australian researchers considered the most accurate relied on very different methodologies. One report, for example, was based on diagnostic PCR tests of all passengers and crew aboard the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that docked in Japan after it was overcome by the coronavirus. Another study drew data from an antibody survey of 38,000 Spaniards, while another included only 1,104 Swedes. The current W.H.O. estimate is based on later, larger studies of how many people have antibodies in their blood; future studies may further refine the figure, Dr. Swaminathan said. But there is “a lot of uncertainty” about how many silent and untested carriers there are, Dr. Morgan of the W.H.O. said. To arrive at the C.D.C.’s new estimate, researchers tested samples from 11,933 people for antibodies to the coronavirus in six regions in the United States. New York City reported 53,803 cases by April 1, but the actual number of infections was 12 times higher — nearly 642,000, the agency estimated. New York City’s prevalence of 7 percent in the C.D.C. study was well below the 21 percent estimated in a state survey in April. But that number was based on people recruited at supermarkets, and so the results may have been biased toward people out shopping during a pandemic — often the young, who have been less affected. The global fatality rates could still change. With one or two exceptions, like Iran and Ecuador, the pandemic first struck wealthier countries in Asia, Western Europe and North America where advanced medical care was available. Now it is spreading widely in India, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria and other countries where millions are crowded into slums, lockdowns have been relatively brief and hospitals have few resources. But the death rates may also shift in wealthier northern countries as winter approaches. Most of the spread of the virus in Europe and North America has taken place during mild or warm weather in the spring and summer. Many experts fear that infections and deaths will shoot up in the fall as colder weather forces people indoors, where they are more likely to infect one another. Discipline about wearing masks and avoiding breathing on one another will be even more important then. In each of the eight influenza pandemics to hit the United States since 1763, a relatively mild first wave — no matter what time of year it arrived — was followed by a larger, much more lethal wave a few months later, noted Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. More than a third of all the people killed by the Spanish flu, which lasted from March 1918 to late 1920, died in the short stretch between September and December 1918 — about six months after a first, relatively mild version of what may have been the same virus broke out in western Kansas. “We will go much higher in the next 12 to 18 months,” Dr. Osterholm said. Because this is a coronavirus, not influenza, it may not follow the same pattern, but it is “a much more efficient transmitter than influenza.” AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World U.S. Politics Election 2020 New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater Watching Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Crossword Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account news Home Page World U.S. Politics Election 2020 New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater Watching Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Crossword Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Crossword Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2020 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Help Subscriptions"

Josh Harcus sells robots for a living. Robotic vacuum cleaners, to be specific — a model called the Whiz, which his employer, SoftBank Robotics America, released here last fall. The company, part of a group owned by the Japanese conglomerate, has deployed more than 6,000 of the robots around the world, including at Facebook headquarters. They look like something out of “Wall-E”: a rolling gray cylinder about thigh-high that trundles back and forth over carpets, sucking up dirt. Many of Harcus’s customers are major airports and hotel chains or the huge cleaning companies hired by them. SoftBank Robotics rents the units to clients, at an annual cost of $6,000 per machine. It’s an expensive lease, so all last fall and through the winter Harcus was traveling around, showing off the Whiz, pressing the flesh to convince customers of its value. “Probably a good 80 percent of my time was on the road,” he says. He would pack up a robot, fly it into town, turn up at the hotel and then have it go to work in front of the staff. “It feels kind of like vacuum sales back in the day, like Hoover sales: You show up, throw dirt on the ground, scoop up the dirt — ‘How many do ya want?’” He had mastered a sales pitch filled with patter about industrial filth. (“Not to bore you with stats, but a foot of carpet can hold up to a pound of dirt,” he told me. “Honestly? Those are the nastiest hallways in the world.”) When Covid-19 hit, Harcus’s company, like most firms across the country, sent its office staff home. Overnight, it essentially became a remote workplace. There was still a lot of demand for the robots, Harcus knew; he kept in touch online with cleaning firms, which told him that hotels were desperate to clean their premises even more intensely now, to convince guests that they could safely visit. But Harcus was stuck sitting on the gray couch in his small San Francisco apartment, trying to figure out a new challenge: How do you sell a robot to people who can’t touch it? After discovering that executives were easy to reach — “They’re bored,” he says, “because they’re used to being in the field, cleaning” — Harcus began making five or six sales calls a day over Zoom, the videoconferencing app. Because he couldn’t show the Whiz to his prospective customers in person, his colleagues created a looping image of the robot zipping around a hotel, which he ran in Zoom’s “virtual background,” while his face and torso floated in front of it, as if he were a YouTube streamer talking over a video. Harcus, who is 31, with dark hair, dark-framed glasses and a wide smile he flashes readily, studied webcam technique to get his lighting right. (“We call it the ‘witness-protection-program look’ that you’re trying to avoid, where you look superdark,” he says.) And he came up with new patter. Talk about the weather was out, while commiserating over at-home child care was in: “I have a lot of screenshots running of babies crawling on people I’ve met.” It worked; clients kept signing contracts. The day before we spoke in early May, Harcus said, he closed deals with six hotels. He shared with me a recording of a call with Michael Asnani, the operations manager at Ganir & Company, a firm that cleans hotel chains like Marriott and Sheraton. Asnani said he liked the idea of robots taking over the hallway vacuuming, because it would free his staff to do extra, trickier cleaning and linen-folding. Harcus pointed out that robots record data on the carpet area they’ve covered, helping prove to skittish hotels that surfaces had been scoured. “Nice, nice,” Asnani said. “That’s awesome.” The success of Harcus’s remote sales surprised everyone at SoftBank Robotics. Kass Dawson, a marketing and communications executive there, had been worried that employees would slack off if they weren’t in the office. Instead, they all began working so nervously, even neurotically, that productivity rose, Dawson told me. The hours that employees previously spent commuting were now poured into sales or into training customers online. Today Harcus can’t quite believe how time-intensive sales used to be. “We spent all this time, we flew robots out — we flew out,” he says. Yet usually the face-to-face demo was astonishingly brief. “Hours! Hours and days of prep! Just for a 10-minute discussion.” The customer would look at the robot, “and they were like: Wow, you’re right. It picks up dirt, and it keeps doing it. I don’t have any questions.” He laughs. “We traveled all for this. Like, that’s it?” This has caused him and his colleagues to wonder what’s crazier: being forced to work from home, peering into a webcam all day? Or the way they used to work? That question and others like it have been caroming around white-collar, office-work America for months now. In a May working paper, Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor in management science at M.I.T., and a group of academics reported survey results indicating that half of those who were employed before the pandemic were now working remotely. That’s a significant increase — pre-Covid-19, the paper estimates, the figure was about 15 percent. (In 2018, a U.S. Census Bureau survey found that just 5.3 percent of Americans worked from home full time.) It’s a situation deeply skewed toward the privileged: Many employees who work in health care, public transportation or the service sector, for instance, have never been given the option to work remotely, during the crisis or before. At companies where remote work is possible, though, many now expect it to continue for quite some time. As Kass told me, the remote experience at SoftBank Robotics is “absolutely going to change the way we think about as a company who needs to be in the office and not.” The coronavirus crisis is forcing white-collar America to reconsider nearly every aspect of office life. Some practices now seem to be wastes of time, happily discarded; others seem to be unexpectedly crucial, and impossible to replicate online. For workers wondering right now if they’re ever going back to the office, the most honest answer is this: Even if they do, the office might never be the same. The consulting firm Accenture has more than 500,000 employees worldwide. Before the pandemic, no more than 10 percent of them worked remotely on any given day. By the middle of March, though, nearly all of them had been sent home. Their use of Microsoft Teams — software that enables co-workers to talk, videoconference, whiteboard and chat by text with one another — erupted. The volume of video calls went up sixfold; the audio calls tripled, to 900 million minutes. “Just to put that in context, that’s 1,700 years of continuous audio,” Paul Daugherty, the firm’s chief technology officer, told me from his home office, where a huge ship’s wheel could be seen hanging over his bookcase (“I’m a nerdy sailor,” he joked). Employees adapted quickly, he says: “They were using ironing boards as a stand-up desk.” But what astonished him was that even though they had lost the easy rapport of face-to-face office contact, productivity didn’t sink. It went up, when measured by several metrics — developer productivity, for example. “If you, six months ago, had said, ‘We’re going to give you a few weeks’ notice, and then you’re going to have your whole work force working from home,’ I would have said: ‘You’re insane. There’s no way it’s possible.’” It’s difficult, in a pandemic, to judge how sustainable this surge in remote work is. Home life in a lockdown is much harder than usual. Many workers who live alone are experiencing enforced isolation as an emotional grind. Among those with young children, many are finding it exhausting to juggle child care, home schooling and their jobs. A senior communications specialist at TD Ameritrade, Ruby Gu, told me that she and her husband, a quality-assurance engineer, were taking turns hunkered down in their basement while the other looked after their 21-month-old and 4-year-old in the living room above (“two small children running around over my head right now”). A marketing director and parent of two toddlers told me her new hours were “9 to 4,” by which she meant 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., the only quiet hours she could find to work. Illustration by Max Guther It’s a messy moment, further blurring a line between home and office that has already been heavily eroded by phones and computers. Nearly every parent I spoke to had their fingers crossed that schools and day care would reopen in the fall — at which point remote work might become an option they could choose, as opposed to one they were forced to endure. Assuming that such a day does arrive, it’s possible that quite a few may elect to continue working outside the office. Research conducted before the pandemic found that remote work offers significant positive effects for both employee and employer. One is productivity. What Accenture discovered is not, it seems, a fluke: Output often rises when people work remotely. In 2012, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, headquartered in Northern Virginia, began a program allowing patent examiners to live anywhere. For those who chose to work remotely, productivity rose by 4.4 percent, according to a study last fall by Prithwiraj Choudhury, a professor at Harvard Business School, and two colleagues. A 2015 case study by Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University, and others found that when one Chinese travel agency assigned a random group of employees to work remotely for nine months, their productivity went up by 13 percent, generating an increase of roughly $2,000 in annual profits per employee. (It later rose even higher, to 20 percent.) The company’s chief executive had actually expected productivity to decrease; he figured the shift would yield savings that made up for the lost output. “But it was win-win,” Bloom says. As far as could be determined, the boost in productivity derived from employees’ being able to work more efficiently, without interruptions from their colleagues. (One employee reported that working from home was a welcome respite from her former cubicle-mate, who had a habit of loudly clipping her toenails.) People also worked more hours: There was no commute to make them late for their shifts, and even their tea breaks were briefer. Working at home can also improve how employees feel about their jobs. Historically, “research has shown a powerful correlation between telecommuting and job satisfaction,” says Timothy Golden, a professor of management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who has studied telework for two decades. People tend to prize the greater flexibility in setting their work hours, the additional time with family members, the reduced distractions. Even with the onslaught of online messages confronting teleworkers, “no one’s stopping by your cubicle standing over you saying, ‘Hey, I need this,’ or ‘I need your help right now,’” Golden told me recently. Another attraction for employers: shrinking real estate costs. With fewer employees in-house, firms can shed space; for the U.S. Patent Office, “real estate savings were immense” — fully $38 million, according to Choudhury. What’s more, companies can hire talented employees who can’t afford or don’t want to relocate to exorbitantly expensive coastal cities. And in the pandemic, they may need to accommodate employees who — even after health authorities “reopen” their state — don’t want to come back. Many will hesitate at the idea of riding a crowded, unventilated elevator to an open office where people are crowded together. Remote jobs can come with unsettling side effects for employees, though. Research finds that work hours encroach on leisure time. And surveillance is a potential hazard, as privacy advocates note: During the pandemic, there has been an uptick in companies using software to track what their employees are doing at their laptops — “which is a little bit scary,” says Enid Zhou, a lawyer with the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center. In the last month, several executives have announced sweeping plans to permanently increase the number of employees operating outside the office. At Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has said he expects 50 percent of his work force to be doing their jobs remotely in as little as five years. Twitter’s leadership announced that anyone who wants to telecommute can now do so, forever. Nationwide Insurance sent nearly its entire staff home in mid-March and found the move so productive that it is closing six offices; 32 percent of its personnel will work remotely. That’s about four times more than before, Gale King, Nationwide’s executive vice president and chief administrative officer, told me. (She herself has become so adroit online that, she says, “I’m like a new millennial.”) At Accenture, Daugherty says, many employees will certainly return to the office eventually — but according to a global survey of its customers, 49 percent of those who had never before worked from home said they “plan to do it more often,” even after the pandemic eases. He says companies are figuring out how to “virtualize” every part of work — every meeting, every employee check-in — so that it could potentially be done remotely. “It has accelerated three years of digital cultural adaptation to three months,” he says. Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, got a glimpse of how the pandemic had changed his firm two weeks into the crisis, when his company’s “all hands” meeting — traditionally a slick, elaborate production — was abruptly transformed. Slack makes communication software, which many companies (including The Times) use to keep live conversations going among staff members. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, with offices in nine other countries. Butterfield throws monthly meetings that every employee is strongly encouraged to attend, held at the headquarters’ biggest meeting areas, where senior executives update employees on the state and direction of the firm. “Normally,” Butterfield told me, “our all-hands are an hour long.” They’re grandly staged events, with the executives preparing drafts of slides, then getting feedback and tweaking them, and diligently rehearsing their presentations. “There’s multiple cameras and live editing, and it’s broadcast out to all the different offices.” He estimates that “probably hundreds of hours of preparation” go into the efforts. You might expect there to be a lot of remote workers at a place like Slack — after all, the whole point of its product is to help people collaborate while scattered to the winds. But fully 95 percent of Slack’s 2,000-plus employees work in one of the company’s offices. After the pandemic hit, they were sent home, which is where they were when the latest all-hands meeting rolled around. Butterfield gave up on the complex production values this time. Instead, employees merely watched a Zoom broadcast, and presentations were short and spartan. “There were seven execs,” Butterfield recalls, “and everyone spoke between 30 and 90 seconds.” Each executive expressed gratitude to staff, then briefly explained his or her most important priorities — “and that was it.” The entire thing was over in 21 minutes. It had moments of Zoom levity: “There was one moment where Julie Liegl, our chief marketing officer, was giving her update, and she had one daughter suddenly jump into her lap and another daughter come behind her chair and start dancing, and she didn’t miss a beat, just kept going. And that got huge rave reviews from across the company, because she’s modeling the behavior — your kids are going to creep into the video, and that’s OK.” Staff members rated this all-hands event higher than any previous one. Now Butterfield, too, is wondering: Did he ever really need such elaborate all-hands meetings? Did that corporate pageantry serve enough of a purpose to make the expenditure of time worthwhile? “There’s all kinds of habits and practices that develop that aren’t effective,” Butterfield told me. “You think you can’t do something — and then you have to do it. And so it turns out you can.” Meetings, of course, have long been a lightning rod in corporate life. Many are crucial for coordination; others seem pointless. But as executives know, it can be hard to tell the difference. Because communication is generally essential to every company’s mission, most meetings that are proposed take place, and then are scheduled again and again until they build up on employee calendars like plaque. Most evidence suggests that employees pine for fewer meetings. Recently Constance Noonan Hadley, a lecturer in management at Boston University, and a team of academics surveyed 182 senior managers; 71 percent found too many of their meetings “unproductive and inefficient”, and nearly two-thirds thought they came “at the expense of deep thinking.” The sudden shift to online meetings has prompted executives and employees everywhere to rethink how many are truly necessary. In the early days of the pandemic, most of the workers I spoke to told me, they frantically began setting up video meetings to replicate every get-together they would normally hold face to face. But they quickly discovered video meetings didn’t flow nearly as well. The easy give-and-take of conversation had dissolved. Because the video signal is often delayed, people in an online meeting wind up accidentally talking over one another, so they overcorrect by talking less often, pausing for a long time before jumping in — or developing complex turn-taking systems, making the tempo of conversation sludgy and awkward. “It’s almost like ‘Robert’s Rules of Order’ have come back in, like Parliament,” K.C. Estenson says. Estenson, the chief executive of GoNoodle, a seven-year-old company in Nashville that produces “movement and mindfulness” videos for elementary-school children, sent home his staff of several dozen on March 15. Only the week before, the firm had completed a million-dollar renovation on its downtown office. “I mean, literally, the last day I was in the office, the guys were inside, fine-tuning the tile in the kitchen.” He laughs darkly. “Now, frankly, it seems like the worst business decision I ever made.” Estenson and his staff had gone through the honeymoon period with Google Meet and Zoom — they dove in, held a lot of crowded sessions, then hit the wall and pulled back a bit. Meetings became smaller and less frequent. Estenson was running himself ragged doing dozens of “one on one” check-ins. “It forces people to be more thoughtful about who is in meetings,” Chaye Eichenberger, GoNoodle’s head of sales strategy and account management at the time, told me. I met her online at a couple of Zoom “happy hours” she held with numerous other employees, each of whom had dialed in from home, swirling glasses of wine and hoisting cocktails. Like Estenson, they had, over weeks of experimentation, begun to recognize and adjust to the strengths and weaknesses of their various communications tools. Zoom meetings carried a whiff of formality, since they were preplanned — with a link to join sent around — so it felt like filing into a conference room: useful for talking business, but a bit stiff for batting around ideas between two people. So, for quick, one-to-one talks, they gravitated to a feature in Slack that enables video calls between two users. Someone who saw a colleague logged into Slack — signaled by a green dot beside the name — could instantly request a video chat. It was more like popping your head over a cubicle wall unannounced, to engage a colleague in an impromptu two-minute confab. Tracy Coats, the company’s director of partnerships, said she had become an ardent fan of this practice. “I want to see my co-workers’ faces!” she yelled cheerfully, looming forward into her webcam, a mass of long hair and aviator glasses. “I want to see Kristie’s face, Shawna’s face, Julie’s face!” “That green dot is pretty powerful,” Eichenberger said. “Because, you know, I’m an early-morning girl. So at 6 a.m., I’m like: Who’s up? Do I have anything I need to cover with them? Because I can do it now as opposed to later.” Julie Crabill, the company’s new chief marketing officer, laughed. “I’m the same, but late at night,” she said. “I’m still online! I’m coming for you!” They were, everyone agreed, just as productive as ever, maybe more so. They had reduced the frequency of their formal meetings, yet the communication felt nonstop — a flurry of Slack messages and emails too. This is, indeed, what nearly every scholar who has studied the history of remote work will tell you: “You have to communicate way more than you ever thought was necessary — it feels weird at first, but then it becomes more normal,” Barbara Larson, an executive professor of management at Northeastern University, told me. Even if they can cut down on meetings, remote colleagues still need to somehow replace the value of small talk, those seemingly casual interchanges that keep information flowing. Without that easy rapport, feelings of isolation quickly set in. Indeed, isolation typically has been a chief complaint that arises in all research on remote work. Most of the GoNoodle executives attested to it. Remote work can thus present a paradox: You can feel removed from colleagues even while drowning in digital messages from them. “My days have been a million times busier since all of this happened,” Eichenberger said. “So, going pee is like the highlight of my day. Like, Oh, my god, I actually have a two-minute break and I can pee.” “Life has just sped up so fast,” Coats agreed. “All the partners that I talk to, they feel the same way. They’re like, Yeah, this is just feeling more like intense for some reason now. Mach 5, like, all the time.” Shawna Streeter, then the company’s vice president for finance, nodded. She added that she looked forward to the day when the lockdown was over and she could have a waiter place a meal in front of her and then take the dirty dishes away. “I feel like I’m cooking 250 meals a day.” Illustration by Max Guther Beyond the feverish pace of online work, employees are experiencing some problems specific to video — what has popularly come to be called “Zoom fatigue.” In late March I spoke via Zoom to Jessica Lindl, a vice president at Unity, a company that makes software for creating and operating interactive 3-D environments. Before the pandemic, Unity’s 3,700-person staff conducted about 10,000 Zoom calls a month. They were now doing five times as many. She was impressed by how productive Unity’s employees had been — they launched a new, 25,000-student online training class in the middle of the pandemic. But doing back-to-back Zoom calls was, they found, unexpectedly draining. “I just got off a call with my C.E.O., and he’s like, ‘Oh, my God, I’m Zoomed out,’” Lindl told me, sitting at a desk on the top floor of her house. She, too, would find that after a day of nonstop Zoom meetings, she was spent. “I come to Friday night, when all my friends wanted to do virtual happy hours, and I’m: ‘I can’t do it! I am exhausted.’” Many people I spoke to described the same phenomenon, triggered by any form of video interaction. Scientists of human perception say this is rooted in how today’s video violates our normal use of eye-gaze, including how long we look at each other, and how often we do. When we’re hanging out together, we’re constantly exchanging glances — but only brief ones. Long stares, research shows, seem quite threatening. In one study by Isabelle Mareschal, who runs a visual-perception lab at Queen Mary University of London, and her colleagues, experimental subjects were asked to look at a video of a face that turned to stare directly at them. People found the gaze enjoyable, but only for about three seconds. After that, it became unsettling. In this context, videoconferencing is characterized by remarkably poor design, because we’re expected to face the camera and stare. We could look away, but as most users intuit, that seems rude. After all, if we turn away from our laptops, a video-chat partner can’t tell what we’re looking at; maybe we’re ignoring them. So we stare and stare. The polite thing also winds up being the creepy thing. “It really does come to the fact you feel that your attention has to be completely directed to the person on the screen,” Mareschal says. Video chat also makes it harder to achieve “synchrony,” a sort of unconscious, balletic call-and-response that emerges when two people are in the same room. In this situation, we often mimic someone’s body posture without realizing it and scrutinize tiny bits of facial timing — noticing, say, when the other person is about to smile. “People start to synchronize their laughter and their facial expressions over time,” says Paula Niedenthal, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an expert in the science of emotion. “And that’s really useful, because it helps us predict what’s coming next.” Constantly making micropredictions of our partner’s state — and having these turn out to be correct — is, it turns out, crucial to feeling connected. But these predictions are harder to validate when you can’t see a person’s body. They’re hampered further by those stuttering lags in video chat. So we start making “prediction errors,” subconsciously misunderstanding our partner’s signals, which in turn makes us feel awkward, alienated from the person at hand. The more you ponder videoconferencing design, the sketchier it seems. For example, most apps by default show you an image of yourself. “So you’re trying to try to get out of the habit of staring at yourself,” says Andrew S. Franklin, a psychologist at Norfolk State University. Your eyes keep darting to that image of your own face, breaking whatever attention you were paying to your conversational partner’s signals. “What you would normally say in face-to-face interaction smoothly comes out jumbled,” Franklin says. Worse, when you’re in a “Brady Bunch” meeting with a dozen people arrayed in a grid, they’re all staring straight at you. No halfway normal meeting of humans behaves like that. It’s possible that we’re still in an awkward adolescent phase with video calling, that protocols for how to behave correctly haven’t yet emerged. (In the telephone’s early days, some users debated whether saying “Hello” at the outset of a call sounded friendly or barbaric.) Already, people are inventing clever adaptations to make video calls less strained. One neighbor of mine, a psychiatrist, began seeing all his patients remotely. He devised a clever setup with one of them: They each face sideways, so neither is staring at the other. It captures some of the style of their previous, in-person sessions, when my friend sat in a chair and his patient reclined on a couch. But if they want to look directly at each other, they can. “It works surprisingly well,” my friend says. Other strategies may emerge. One scientist, David Nguyen, says he has found evidence that standing back from your camera can reduce creepiness. Nguyen is currently director of Accenture Labs in Shenzen — part of the research wing of the consulting firm — and in his Ph.D. studies he investigated how well people bonded over video chat. In one experiment, he and a colleague had groups of subjects talk in pairs. Some spoke using video that focused on their partner’s face; others talked using a camera that showed their upper bodies; some spoke face to face. Nguyen then had the subjects fill out a questionnaire individually and brought them together afterward to stage a secret test of how well they had bonded. One would sit in a room, awaiting the other; upon arrival, the partner feigned a little accident, dropping some pens on the floor. Nguyen wanted to see if the other partner would help pick the pens up. Twice as many people who’d seen their partners’ upper bodies in video chat helped to scoop up the pens, compared with those who had only seen their partner’s face. In essence, having a bigger view helped them achieve synchrony and bond with their opposite number. These days, when Nguyen video-chats, he sits a few feet away from his keyboard, so his upper body is visible. He also speaks more emotively. “Ramp up the words that you’re saying,” he notes, “and then exaggerate the way you say it.” His research suggests another intriguing idea, which is that maybe the aspect ratio of videoconferencing needs to change. On a laptop, many corporate video tools display you in landscape mode, the way Hollywood movies are shot and the easiest orientation on their horizontal screens. But that framing cuts off the rest of your body. In contrast, the newer generation of video-focused social networks, like TikTok, were built for the mobile phone, which usually takes a vertical shot, neatly showcasing the entire body. The explosive growth of TikTok — and its riot of joyful, full-body dance moves — may owe something to our deeply baked perceptual psychology. Doreen Bucher is the vice president for global marketing at Symrise, where she works with major brands to create new scents for high-end perfumes — “what we in our industry parlance call ‘the juice,’” she told me dryly. Marketing an expensive new fragrance requires a lot of visual creativity. Advertising cannot convey the actual scent, of course, so it has to paint a picture of an idea, the fragrance’s essence. (“We always say that people kind of smell with their eyes.”) In her routine, prepandemic office life, Bucher used to sit with her graphic designer, and they would pore over visual ideas on paper, pointing to different parts of the page as they batted concepts about. “We’d have this incredible dialogue,” since both could look at the same thing together. Doing it remotely has been painfully difficult. “I’m like: OK, go to Page 5. OK, now go back to Page 4. You see the box on Page 4? I want that box on Page 5,” she says. “It’s so crazy to try to figure that out.” Many of Bucher’s best ideas were, she feels, rooted in off-the-cuff trendspotting conversations she’d have with her two millennial teammates who sat nearby. “I’m famous for just standing up and being like: ‘Have you guys thought about the color purple and what that even means? Like, why is that a trend?’” she says, laughing. She once demanded of her co-workers, “Do millennials love clowns?” Bucher interrupted her colleagues a lot, she admits. (“I miss you” she recently told one. “I’m not sure if you miss me.”) But those seemingly trivial flights of fancy would occasionally spark genuinely useful new ideas for the business. When remote, they’re less frequent. That’s because office work is more than just straightforward productivity — briskly ticking off to-do items. It also consists of the chemistry and workplace culture that comes from employees’ interacting all day, in ways that are unexpected and often inefficient, like the stray conversations that take place while people are procrastinating or bumping into one another on the way to lunch. During the pandemic, though, many employees worry that this culture is eroding. Ben Waber, the president and co-founder of Humanyze, has spent his career tracking patterns among how employees communicate and how these correlate to companies’ health; Humanyze creates software that lets an organization map how communication flows internally. Waber suspects that in the long run, a company’s culture and creativity risk declining in a remote setup, because that alters the way an organization talks to itself. Specifically, the “weak ties” inside a company might fray. “Strong ties” are people in your life you talk to frequently, even daily. “Weak ties” are the people with whom you rarely communicate, perhaps 15 minutes a week or less. When the pandemic hit, Waber analyzed the data from his clients’ companies and saw two things. One was that strong ties were becoming stronger. Ordinarily, 45 percent of the time someone spent communicating with colleagues — online or face to face — was with their five strongest ties. In the first weeks of lockdown, that figure exceeded 60 percent. That makes sense: “You’re stressed about work, and these are the people you know really well, so you’ll probably talk to them more,” Waber told me. That’s partly why productivity has stayed so high. But the weak ties had deteriorated. Employees’ contact with more-distant colleagues had “fallen off a cliff,” dropping by 30 percent. Which again makes sense: If you only have so much time to communicate, you’re going to have to drop someone. But Waber contends that it’s those weak ties that create new ideas. Corporations have historically seen some of the biggest new ideas emerge, he says, when two employees who usually didn’t talk suddenly, by chance, connected. That is less likely to happen when everyone is remote. You might imagine that technology could connect people in those silos, enabling anyone talk to anyone. But in practice, it doesn’t. “There’s the idea that, like, Can’t you Slack with anybody in the company? Sure you can. But you don’t: You’re not just going to cold-message somebody. Whereas you would have occasionally bumped into those people if you were in an office,” like in the cafeteria, at an after-work event or while lining up for coffee in the morning. Waber predicts that companies will continue to hit their marks and be productive while remaining partly — or heavily — remote. The real damage will sneak up a year or two later, as the quality of new ideas becomes less bold, less electrifying. He also suspects that the overall cohesion of employees, how well they know one another, might suffer. “I think we’re going to see just this general degradation of the health of organizations,” he says. Research suggests that people find it harder to build cohesion and trust online. David Nguyen says his academic research found that “in a videoconferencing situation, trust is actually quite fragile.” Work by him and others in the field shows that people more readily form cooperative bonds when they are face to face, whereas in video “trust is diminished overall,” he says. “Trust grows a little slower than in face-to-face conditions.” There are ways to establish trust in remote collaborators, though, by injecting a bit of face-to-face interaction into the virtual interaction. In a 1998 experiment by Elena Rocco, then at the University of Michigan, participants were told to play a “prisoner’s dilemma”-like game, where they could either collaborate — and win more — or betray one another, winning at the expense of others. Groups that connected solely online (the experiment used email rather than video) did not collaborate very well. But when they were allowed to meet for brief periods face to face, their rates of cooperation rose dramatically. This suggests, as Nguyen notes, a middle path in remote collaboration in which trust is critical: Corporations shouldn’t make it total. If employees are able to meet in person some of the time, it can help build the bonds that make remote collaboration richer. This is precisely the tack taken by many companies that, long before the pandemic, operated fully remotely. GitLab Inc., for example, makes software that allows groups of people to share and work on computer code jointly. It has more than 1,200 employees worldwide but no office, so at least once a year it flies all employees to a weeklong gathering, where they conduct training sessions, hang out and absorb the company culture. Other organizations have created staggered office hours: Employees generally work remotely, but individual teams or groups of colleagues show up a day or two each week to work together. This partway-remote approach may, in fact, be a sort of happy medium, a state in which companies get the benefits of productivity without losing their cohesion or creativity. When Timothy Golden, the scholar of remote work, was part of a team that studied job satisfaction, it found that workers’ happiness grew in correlation with the number of hours they worked remotely — up to 15 hours a week, at which point, he told me, “it plateaued.” If that holds up, he says, then spending two days a week remotely could let a worker gain all the benefits before a “sense of isolation,” or perhaps “some increased difficulty communicating,” begins to eat into the gains. The truth is that as newfangled as remote work may seem, it relies on a set of tools that are by now quite old: video calls, discussion boards, chat, shared online documents. They’ve hardly changed in years. And that’s precisely the space where a new set of inventors see potential: to fix the drawbacks of remote work by revamping the tools through which we conduct it. One afternoon this spring, I made a video call to Doug Safreno, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Pragli, who is trying to reinvent the online office so that it feels like a social network, except one based on audio. He showed me the screen of his new company’s app. He was using it while we spoke; on his screen were cartoon icons showing his work colleagues, spread out all over the Bay Area, in their homes. Clicking on any of their icons would ring them up; in another mode, a user can just click and start talking. “It’s like a walkie-talkie,” Safreno said. “It’s kind of like shouting into their rooms. And then they can talk back to you.” Users can set their status to show whether they’re available for an unsolicited chat (“door open,” “door closed”). If Safreno starts speaking to a colleague, that person can either keep their conversation private or make it publicly visible, so anyone else in the office can click on their icons and join in. The goal, he added, was to emulate the free-floating banter in an office, where people overhear and jump into one another’s discussions. Safreno pointed to the various icons of his workmates: Some status alerts showed they were listening to music; others were in do-not-disturb mode. “Vivek here is available,” he said. He pointed to another person, the company’s lead investor. “He’s online, but he’s in a meeting, so I don’t want to bug him. If one of them wanted to, they could jump in and start chatting with us.” Users can also make video calls on Pragli, or chat in text; but the audio, Safreno argues, is the most pleasant mode for casual back and forth. Indeed, many people who’d complained of “Zoom fatigue” to me had gravitated toward old-school phone calls to rest their eyes and, thus, their brains. There may also be innovations that let us use video but avoid the fatigue of decoding one another’s faces. One example is Loom.ai, a new chat app that lets you use a regular videoconferencing app — Zoom, Microsoft Teams — except you appear as an avatar. Stylistically, the avatars have the approachable, cartoony style of Apple’s “memoji,” except here they have a torso and arms. Users can customize their onscreen cartoon to resemble themselves if they want. Recently I took part in a video call with Loom.ai’s co-founders, Mahesh Ramasubramanian and Kiran Bhat. Ramasubramanian logged on as an avatar with a thick mop of dark hair swooping over his left brow, a rough approximation of his everyday appearance. Bhat’s avatar sported his dark horn-rimmed glasses and a red shirt under a sweater vest. While the two founders spoke, I could hear their real-life voices, as their onscreen avatars lip-synced closely with their speech. The sound of your voice, Bhat explained, controls the avatar; it matches the lip movement as closely as possible to your words. Hanging out with the avatars was a curious sensation — somewhat like when I interact with other players inside an online video game like Animal Crossing. The goal of the app, Bhat explained, is to let users feel as if they’re visually present with other people, without needing to actually be on camera. Indeed, his webcam wasn’t even turned on. That also meant he could stand up or wander from his desk; so long as his laptop’s microphone still picked up his voice, I would see his avatar chatting away and gesticulating. “I could be present at this meeting, but I don’t have to stare at the screen the whole time. It’s very liberating,” Bhat told me. This way, a group of people could meet, talk and look at their screenful of avatars — if they wanted to “see” the others — but not feel compelled to do so. And “that whole pressure of having to be dressed up or have the camera set up correctly, or the lighting needs to be set up or the background needs to be set up — all of that is gone.” Ramasubramanian and Bhat came from the world of 3-D animation, having worked at DreamWorks Animation and Lucasfilm. But their work was inspired by having met Jeremy Bailenson, a professor of communication at Stanford who studies virtual reality and who has become an adviser to Loom.ai. Bailenson told me that chatting with cartoon-style avatars seems to be easier on our brains; it’s easier to build synchrony with them. Viewing an avatar’s cartoony features doesn’t require as much mental processing as watching live video of a human face. Bailenson suspects that the real future of videoconferencing will be a blend of cartoons and our real, physical environment. We’ll use “augmented reality” glasses that paint holograms afloat in the world around us. He has already used prototypes of such glasses that let him speak to a remote participant, teleported into the room, appearing as a 3-D cartoony avatar — a sort of midway point between Loom.ai’s technique and actual reality. “It was all just mind-blowingly good,” he says. Such glasses cost thousands of dollars now, and are relatively heavy to wear; Microsoft has a “HoloLens” that is $3,500 and grips your head like a visor. Bailenson figures it’ll be five or so years before the glasses are as light and affordable as regular eyeglasses you wear today. “It’ll solve a lot of these problems that we’re talking about today, because it’ll make a meeting feel so much like a real meeting. It’s because it’s going to feel like there’s somebody in your room.” In contemplating a remote-work future, not everyone is ready to give up on the look and feel of real-world offices. Paul Daugherty, Accenture’s chief technology officer, says its internal research-and-development groups have been setting up experimental meeting rooms in virtual reality, using the Oculus headset created by Facebook. They’ve created replicas of some of their offices; recently he took visitors on a tour of the Accenture office in Sophia Antipolis, in France. “I was there with a person from Geneva, a person from Paris,” he says. “It was strikingly good.” The truth, as I heard from many of the newly remote workers I interviewed, is that as much as our offices can be inefficient, productivity-killing spreaders of infectious disease, a lot of people are desperate to get back to them. At the Zoom “happy hour” at GoNoodle, when the employees talked about their newly renovated office, they sounded wistful. They yearned for the tricked-out kitchen, the plants and big dark couches, ideal for lounging. “We had this killer sound system,” Tracy Coats said, with a sigh. She’s an extrovert, she said, who longs to hang out with her “peeps.” “You know — we’re drinking coffee, or maybe, Hey, want to take a walk? I miss that.” Developing a Covid-19 VaccineWhat If Working From Home Goes on … ForeverThe Pandemic and ArchitectureInformation Can Be the Best Medicine Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine, as well as a columnist for Wired and Smithsonian.

There are lots of unanswered questions. Police officers and soldiers in Melbourne, Australia, on Sunday, after tougher restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus were announced. Credit...William West/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images By Damien Cave Aug. 4, 2020 Australia’s second-largest city, Melbourne, is grappling with a spiraling coronavirus outbreak that has led to a lockdown with some of the toughest restrictions in the world — offering a preview of what many urban dwellers elsewhere could confront in coming weeks and months. The new lockdown is the product of early success; the country thought it had the virus beat in June. But there was a breakdown in the quarantine program for hotels. Returning travelers passed the virus to hotel security guards in Melbourne, who carried the contagion home. Even after masks became mandatory in the city two weeks ago, the spread continued. And now, as officials try to break the chain of infections, Melbourne is being reshaped by sweeping enforcement and fine print. A confounding matrix of hefty fines for disobedience to the lockdown and minor exceptions for everything from romantic partners to home building has led to silenced streets and endless versions of the question: So, wait, can I ____? Restaurant owners are wondering about food delivery after an 8 p.m. curfew began on Sunday night. Teenagers are asking if their boyfriends and girlfriends count as essential partners. Can animal shelter volunteers walk dogs at night? Are house cleaners essential for those struggling with their mental health? Can people who have been tested exercise outside? “This is such a weird, scary, bizarro time that we live in,” said Tessethia Von Tessle Roberts, 25, a student in Melbourne who admits to having hit a breaking point a few days ago, when her washing machine broke. “Our health care workers are hustling around the clock to keep us alive,” she said. “Our politicians are as scared as we are, but they have to pretend like they have a better idea than we do of what’s going to happen next.” Pandemic lockdowns, never easy, are getting ever more confusing and contentious as they evolve in the face of second and third rounds of outbreaks that have exhausted both officials and residents. With success against the virus as fleeting as the breeze, the new waves of restrictions feel to many like a bombing raid that just won’t end. For some places, risk calculations can change overnight. In Hong Kong, officials banned daytime dining in restaurants last month, only to reverse themselves a day later after an outcry. Schools in some cities are opening and closing like screen doors in summer. In many areas where the virus has retreated and then resurged, the future looks like a long, complicated haul. Leaders are reaching for their own metaphors to try to explain it. Image A nearly deserted Melbourne railway station on Monday.Credit...William West/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has compared his opening and shutting of businesses to a “dimmer switch.” Dan Andrews, the premier in Victoria, the state of which Melbourne is the capital, has repeatedly referred to “pilot light mode” for industries like construction and meatpacking, which have been ordered to temporarily reduce their work forces. Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-07T20:21:57.647Z Cuomo says N.Y. schools can reopen in-person but leaves it up to districts to determine if, when and how. With U.S. stimulus talks stalemated, the jobs report provides little promise of a break in the gridlock. The U.S. economy added jobs last month, but only a small fraction of those lost in the spring. See more updates More live coverage: Markets Whatever the metaphor, the situation is bleak. In Melbourne, a city of five million that is considered a capital of food and culture, the pandemic has come raging back even after a so-called Stage 3 lockdown began in early July — until recently the highest level of restrictions. Officials have been flummoxed at every turn by the persistent complacency of just enough people to let the virus thrive and multiply. Traffic data showed people driving more in July than they had during the first Stage 3 lockdown, in March and April. Even worse, almost nine out of 10 people with Covid-19 had not been tested or isolated when they first felt sick, Mr. Andrews, the state’s top leader, said in late July. And 53 percent had not quarantined while waiting for their test results. “That means people have felt unwell and just gone about their business,” Mr. Andrews said. Sounding the alarm, he made face masks mandatory the next day, on July 22. Still, infections have continued to rise. They peaked at 753 new cases on July 30, and have hovered around 500 a day ever since, with the death toll in Victoria now standing at 147, after 11 deaths were recorded on Monday. Those figures, while far less troublesome than those in the United States, have paved the way for a Stage 4 lockdown — what officials are calling a “shock and awe” attack on the virus — that will last at least six weeks. Image People exercising at Albert Park Lake in Melbourne on Tuesday. Credit...Daniel Pockett/Getty Images Overwhelming force, with precision, seems to be the goal. The chief modelers of the pandemic response in Australia have found that the virus can be suppressed only if more than 70 percent of the population abides by social distancing guidelines and other public health rules. Mr. Andrews said the new restrictions would take 250,000 more people out of their routines, in the hopes of reaching the necessary threshold. So retail stores will be closed. Schools will return to at-home instruction. Restaurants will be takeout or delivery only. Child-care centers will be available only for permitted workers. Those restrictions are already well understood. The rules requiring more explanation are tied to the curfew and industries that have to cut back. Large-scale construction projects of more than three stories, for example, will have to reduce their on-site work force by 75 percent, and workers will not be able to work at more than one location. Small-scale construction cannot have more than five workers. All of which sounds clear. But does a bathroom renovation, for example, amount to home building in an apartment with one bathroom? And what about fixing things that break, like Ms. Von Tessle Roberts’s washing machine? Some businesses, like cleaning services, are already emailing customers to say they think they can do some work, for people who pay through welfare or who need help for mental health reasons. But, like many others, they are still seeking official clarification.

He now oversees, under the lockdown rules, what may be the country’s most intrusive bureaucracy since its days as a penal colony. The Coronavirus Outbreak › Frequently Asked Questions Updated August 6, 2020 Why are bars linked to outbreaks? Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It’s no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close. I have antibodies. Am I now immune? As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time. I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief? The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don’t know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all. What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work? Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus. What is school going to look like in September? It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California’s two largest public school districts — Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community. On Tuesday, he answered questions from reporters about dog-walking (allowed after curfew, sort of, only near home) and other subjects of great confusion at a news conference in Melbourne. Thanking those who complied with the new rules and scolding those who did not, he announced that no one in self-isolation would now be allowed to exercise outdoors. A door-knocking campaign to check in on 3,000 people who had Covid-19 found that 800 of them were not at home. All 800 have been referred to the Victoria police for investigation. The fine for violators going forward, he said, will be 4,957 Australian dollars, $3,532. Working, even legally, will also become trickier. Other than, say, hospital workers with formal identification, everyone traveling for a job deemed essential during the lockdown must carry a formal document — a work permit signed by the employer and employee. For Cara Devine, who works at a wine store that closes at 8 p.m., that means carrying a government form with her everywhere, and hoping that the police recognize her task as essential when she heads home after the curfew. But she also worried about the Uber drivers who take her back and forth. Image Shoppers outside a Melbourne Costco on Sunday.Credit...William West/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “Even before the newest restrictions, I’ve had two Uber drivers being really late picking up from the shop because they got stopped by the police, taking about an hour out of their work time,” she said. The police are already confronting opposition. On at least four occasions in the last week, they reported having to smash the windows of cars and pull people out after they refused to provide a name and address at a police checkpoint. The Victoria police commissioner, Shane Patton, said a 38-year-old woman had also been charged with assault after attacking a police officer who had stopped her for not wearing a face mask. Some criminologists are questioning whether the harsher enforcement will help. Mostly, though, Melburnians are just trying to endure. Walking to get groceries, Peter Barnes, 56, said he welcomed the stricter rules, though he admitted his city was starting to feel like George Orwell’s “1984,” with the heavy hand of the state around every corner. Those focused solely on the economics, he said, should remember the obvious: “You can’t hire a corpse. Very bad employment prospects for people who are dead.” By Monday night, the city seemed to be in listening mode. The streets were emptying out, silent in hibernation. “It’s like a Sunday in the 1950s,” said Mark Rubbo, the owner of Readings, Melbourne’s largest independent bookstore. He also noted that people were stocking up again on books through online orders, with a memoir called “The Happiest Man on Earth,” about a Holocaust survivor, becoming a runaway hit. Ms. Von Tessle Roberts has found another solution, perhaps just as likely to grow in popularity: Stand on your front porch and scream. That’s the name she has given to an event she posted on Facebook, set for Friday at 7 p.m. By Tuesday afternoon, 70,000 people had expressed an interest in joining her collective shout in anguish. “Yelling is great,” she said. “It’s less dehydrating than crying.” Image Melbourne’s central business district on Sunday night.

Credit... Supported byContinue reading the main story By Jenny Taitz • Illustrations by Rozalina Burkova Aug. 6, 2020 In this emotional equivalent to an ultramarathon, it’s key to have some stress-reducing strategies available that work quickly and efficiently to help you hit the reset button. Here’s why: Struggling with chronic worry gets in the way of effectively managing your emotions. Unfortunately, many people who experience distress try to escape their unpleasant emotions by distracting themselves in ways that ultimately backfire. If you suspect you might be one of them, ask yourself whether you have a tendency to judge your emotions — it’s a common thing to do. But it can fuel a vicious loop of feeling, then avoiding the feelings and feeling even worse. Pushing away feelings is like trying to force a beach ball underwater: They will pop back up. Instead, notice and normalize difficult emotions; ideally, negative feelings, including fear, can motivate us to solve problems. So rather than dealing with anxiety and uncertainty by getting lost worrying, then chasing short-term fixes with longer-term consequences, like procrastinating, using food or marijuana to cope or relying on benzodiazepines — the anti-anxiety drugs like Xanax — it’s helpful to experiment with quick strategies that will empower you. These strategies are not necessarily a cure, but can help lower the intensity of overwhelming emotions, allowing you to recalibrate to better deal with challenges you face. My patients often reflect that an additional perk of strategic coping is boosting your sense of mastery — the hope that arises when you stretch yourself and accomplish something difficult, like coping with your anxiety in a productive way. Image Try Music Medicine Focusing on relaxing sounds reduces stress. In research spearheaded by Dr. Veena Graff, an assistant professor in the department of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania, preoperative patients were assigned either to music medicine — listening to Marconi Union’s “Weightless” — or prescribed a benzodiazepine. Remarkably, serene music proved nearly as effective in easing patients’ jitters as the medication option, with no side effects. Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-14T20:55:10.222Z The manager of the Trump administration’s new virus database refuses Senate questioning, citing a nondisclosure agreement. If you recover from the virus, you may be protected for at least three months, the C.D.C. says. Clinical trials for potential virus treatments are taking longer than expected. See more updates More live coverage: Markets To honor your unique taste, explore different options and create a playlist that you find comforting when you need a break. Keep in mind that although it can seem cathartic to hear songs that validate your emotions (for example, listening to lyrics about heartache while feeling lonely), research on inducing varying mood states concludes that we can improve our experience with a more uplifting soundtrack. “Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears — it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear,” as Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in “Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain.” Image Cool Off Marsha Linehan, a professor emeritus in psychology at the University of Washington, popularized an exercise in dialectical behavior therapy to regulate intense emotions that involves immediately lowering your body temperature by creating a mini plunge pool for your face. This sounds odd, but it activates your body’s dive response, a reflex that happens when you cool your nostrils while holding your breath, dampening your physiological and emotional intensity. To do it, fill a large bowl with ice water, set a timer for 15 to 30 seconds, take a deep breath and hold your breath while dipping your face into the water. While this isn’t conventionally relaxing, it will slow your heart rate, allowing blood to flow more easily to your brain. I love watching my clients try this over our telehealth calls and seeing firsthand how quickly this shifts their perspective. Just being willing to do this, I tell my clients as they prepare to submerge, is a way to practice being flexible. Image Pace Your Breathing One of my favorite ideas that never fails to fill me with gratitude, no matter what else is happening, comes from the mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn, who likes to say, “As long as you are breathing, there is more right with you than wrong with you.” In “The Healing Power of the Breath,” Drs. Richard Brown and Patricia Gerbarg offer a range of exercises to promote resilience. One of my favorites: Slow your breathing down to six breaths a minute by consciously inhaling and exhaling (to practice this timing, you can use a secondhand and inhale for five seconds, exhale for five seconds, and repeat four times, or try a guided recording). Paced breathing offers a host of physiological benefits, like reducing your blood pressure, which helps promote a sense of tranquillity. When people tell me it feels challenging to breathe in a certain way when they feel panicked, I tell them to start with alternative soothing activities, like music, and work their way up to paced breathing. Image Practice ‘Anchoring’ Another way to stay present rather than spin into a crisis is to notice if you are engaged in thinking that isn’t helping you. Our interpretations of events supercharge the intensity of our emotions. After all, anticipating, “This will go on for years!” in a moment of anguish will only inspire more hopelessness. But mindfulness, or learning to see more clearly as opposed to jumping to conclusions, is a nice remedy for anxiety. One brief way to enter the moment is known as “anchoring,” a popular strategy. The Coronavirus Outbreak › Frequently Asked Questions Updated August 12, 2020 Can I travel within the United States? Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here’s an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own “pod.” “Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,” the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk. I have antibodies. Am I now immune? As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.

For other districts, the solution won’t be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community. Start by physically centering yourself by digging your heels into the floor — this evokes a feeling of being grounded in reality. Then take a moment to observe: What am I thinking? Feeling in my body? Doing? Then ask yourself: Is my response: A) Helpful? B) Aligned with my values now? Or C) Related to future worries or a past problem? While we can get stuck in specific thoughts, stepping back to more generally decide if those thoughts are helpful can get us out of rumination mode. It may also help to tape a list of these prompts on your computer to remember to take a step back and refocus when your thoughts are only making things worse. Image Hyperventilate If you struggle with physical sensations of anxiety, like muscle tension and feeling like you can’t get enough air, a counterintuitive yet important way to manage is to practice bringing on those sensations in more quiet moments to improve how you tolerate stressful ones. Learning to repeatedly welcome physical symptoms allows you to stop seeing them as catastrophic. In a recent therapy group I led on Zoom, my clients prepared to try this by ordering thin coffee straws. I set my timer for a minute as they pinched their noses and tried to breathe only through the straw. We also worked on replicating the other sensations they associated with fear, like muscle tension, dizziness and shortness of breath. We held a plank, spun in circles and ran in place. Some people were surprised that the practice experience was worse than the anxiety they normally felt. Others found it was similar, which felt liberating — they didn’t have to wait for the feelings to catch them off guard — and instead could purposefully habituate themselves to them. Recently, at the end of a long day of video calls with patients, my 5-year-old daughter asked, “When will the germs go away?” After removing my 3-year-old’s sneaker from my 1-year-old’s mouth, I saw a request from a client about an urgent check-in. I practiced paced breathing and pulled up our nightly dance party playlist (by request: Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling”) before discussing my daughter’s feelings and returning to work. Now I hope you create your own plan with the strategies above. By practicing managing your emotions, you’ll experience a sense of freedom in your life. I don’t know about you, but I’d chase that over any mindless short-term alternative.

Restaurant owners are wondering about food delivery after an 8 p.m. curfew began on Sunday night. Teenagers are asking if their boyfriends and girlfriends count as essential partners. Can animal shelter volunteers walk dogs at night? Are house cleaners essential for those struggling with their mental health? Can people who have been tested exercise outside? “This is such a weird, scary, bizarro time that we live in,” said Tessethia Von Tessle Roberts, 25, a student in Melbourne who admits to having hit a breaking point a few days ago, when her washing machine broke. “Our health care workers are hustling around the clock to keep us alive,” she said. “Our politicians are as scared as we are, but they have to pretend like they have a better idea than we do of what’s going to happen next.” Pandemic lockdowns, never easy, are getting ever more confusing and contentious as they evolve in the face of second and third rounds of outbreaks that have exhausted both officials and residents. With success against the virus as fleeting as the breeze, the new waves of restrictions feel to many like a bombing raid that just won’t end. For some places, risk calculations can change overnight. In Hong Kong, officials banned daytime dining in restaurants last month, only to reverse themselves a day later after an outcry. Schools in some cities are opening and closing like screen doors in summer. In many areas where the virus has retreated and then resurged, the future looks like a long, complicated haul. Leaders are reaching for their own metaphors to try to explain it.

Large-scale construction projects of more than three stories, for example, will have to reduce their on-site work force by 75 percent, and workers will not be able to work at more than one location. Small-scale construction cannot have more than five workers. All of which sounds clear. But does a bathroom renovation, for example, amount to home building in an apartment with one bathroom? And what about fixing things that break, like Ms. Von Tessle Roberts’s washing machine? Some businesses, like cleaning services, are already emailing customers to say they think they can do some work, for people who pay through welfare or who need help for mental health reasons. But, like many others, they are still seeking official clarification. Image The premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, has the difficult job of explaining the many coronavirus restrictions to the public.Credit...David Crosling/EPA, via Shutterstock Mr. Andrews, a Labor politician sometimes described as awkward and paternal, has become the dad everyone needs answers from. He now oversees, under the lockdown rules, what may be the country’s most intrusive bureaucracy since its days as a penal colony. The Coronavirus Outbreak › Frequently Asked Questions Updated August 12, 2020 Can I travel within the United States? Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here’s an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own “pod.” “Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,” the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk. I have antibodies. Am I now immune? As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time. I’m a small-business owner. Can I get relief? The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don’t know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all. What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work? Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus. What is school going to look like in September? It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California’s two largest public school districts — Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community. On Tuesday, he answered questions from reporters about dog-walking (allowed after curfew, sort of, only near home) and other subjects of great confusion at a news conference in Melbourne. Thanking those who complied with the new rules and scolding those who did not, he announced that no one in self-isolation would now be allowed to exercise outdoors. A door-knocking campaign to check in on 3,000 people who had Covid-19 found that 800 of them were not at home. All 800 have been referred to the Victoria police for investigation. The fine for violators going forward, he said, will be 4,957 Australian dollars, $3,532. Working, even legally, will also become trickier. Other than, say, hospital workers with formal identification, everyone traveling for a job deemed essential during the lockdown must carry a formal document — a work permit signed by the employer and employee. For Cara Devine, who works at a wine store that closes at 8 p.m., that means carrying a government form with her everywhere, and hoping that the police recognize her task as essential when she heads home after the curfew. But she also worried about the Uber drivers who take her back and forth. Image Shoppers outside a Melbourne Costco on Sunday.Credit...William West/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “Even before the newest restrictions, I’ve had two Uber drivers being really late picking up from the shop because they got stopped by the police, taking about an hour out of their work time,” she said. The police are already confronting opposition. On at least four occasions in the last week, they reported having to smash the windows of cars and pull people out after they refused to provide a name and address at a police checkpoint. The Victoria police commissioner, Shane Patton, said a 38-year-old woman had also been charged with assault after attacking a police officer who had stopped her for not wearing a face mask. Some criminologists are questioning whether the harsher enforcement will help. Mostly, though, Melburnians are just trying to endure. Walking to get groceries, Peter Barnes, 56, said he welcomed the stricter rules, though he admitted his city was starting to feel like George Orwell’s “1984,” with the heavy hand of the state around every corner. Those focused solely on the economics, he said, should remember the obvious: “You can’t hire a corpse. Very bad employment prospects for people who are dead.” By Monday night, the city seemed to be in listening mode. The streets were emptying out, silent in hibernation. “It’s like a Sunday in the 1950s,” said Mark Rubbo, the owner of Readings, Melbourne’s largest independent bookstore. He also noted that people were stocking up again on books through online orders, with a memoir called “The Happiest Man on Earth,” about a Holocaust survivor, becoming a runaway hit. Ms. Von Tessle Roberts has found another solution, perhaps just as likely to grow in popularity: Stand on your front porch and scream. That’s the name she has given to an event she posted on Facebook, set for Friday at 7 p.m. By Tuesday afternoon, 70,000 people had expressed an interest in joining her collective shout in anguish. “Yelling is great,” she said. “It’s less dehydrating than crying.” Image Melbourne’s central business district on Sunday night.

Credit... Supported byContinue reading the main story By Jenny Taitz • Illustrations by Rozalina Burkova Aug. 6, 2020 In this emotional equivalent to an ultramarathon, it’s key to have some stress-reducing strategies available that work quickly and efficiently to help you hit the reset button. Here’s why: Struggling with chronic worry gets in the way of effectively managing your emotions. Unfortunately, many people who experience distress try to escape their unpleasant emotions by distracting themselves in ways that ultimately backfire. If you suspect you might be one of them, ask yourself whether you have a tendency to judge your emotions — it’s a common thing to do. But it can fuel a vicious loop of feeling, then avoiding the feelings and feeling even worse. Pushing away feelings is like trying to force a beach ball underwater: They will pop back up. Instead, notice and normalize difficult emotions; ideally, negative feelings, including fear, can motivate us to solve problems. So rather than dealing with anxiety and uncertainty by getting lost worrying, then chasing short-term fixes with longer-term consequences, like procrastinating, using food or marijuana to cope or relying on benzodiazepines — the anti-anxiety drugs like Xanax — it’s helpful to experiment with quick strategies that will empower you. These strategies are not necessarily a cure, but can help lower the intensity of overwhelming emotions, allowing you to recalibrate to better deal with challenges you face. My patients often reflect that an additional perk of strategic coping is boosting your sense of mastery — the hope that arises when you stretch yourself and accomplish something difficult, like coping with your anxiety in a productive way. Image Try Music Medicine Focusing on relaxing sounds reduces stress. In research spearheaded by Dr. Veena Graff, an assistant professor in the department of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania, preoperative patients were assigned either to music medicine — listening to Marconi Union’s “Weightless” — or prescribed a benzodiazepine. Remarkably, serene music proved nearly as effective in easing patients’ jitters as the medication option, with no side effects. Latest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-21T22:10:47.057Z A new C.D.C. report suggests that child-care centers may reopen safely in areas where the virus is contained. U.S. universities have been trying to prepare for months, but outbreaks are forcing last-minute changes. Cases surge in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. See more updates More live coverage: Markets To honor your unique taste, explore different options and create a playlist that you find comforting when you need a break. Keep in mind that although it can seem cathartic to hear songs that validate your emotions (for example, listening to lyrics about heartache while feeling lonely), research on inducing varying mood states concludes that we can improve our experience with a more uplifting soundtrack. “Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears — it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear,” as Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in “Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain.” Image Cool Off Marsha Linehan, a professor emeritus in psychology at the University of Washington, popularized an exercise in dialectical behavior therapy to regulate intense emotions that involves immediately lowering your body temperature by creating a mini plunge pool for your face. This sounds odd, but it activates your body’s dive response, a reflex that happens when you cool your nostrils while holding your breath, dampening your physiological and emotional intensity. To do it, fill a large bowl with ice water, set a timer for 15 to 30 seconds, take a deep breath and hold your breath while dipping your face into the water. While this isn’t conventionally relaxing, it will slow your heart rate, allowing blood to flow more easily to your brain. I love watching my clients try this over our telehealth calls and seeing firsthand how quickly this shifts their perspective. Just being willing to do this, I tell my clients as they prepare to submerge, is a way to practice being flexible. Image Pace Your Breathing One of my favorite ideas that never fails to fill me with gratitude, no matter what else is happening, comes from the mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn, who likes to say, “As long as you are breathing, there is more right with you than wrong with you.” In “The Healing Power of the Breath,” Drs. Richard Brown and Patricia Gerbarg offer a range of exercises to promote resilience. One of my favorites: Slow your breathing down to six breaths a minute by consciously inhaling and exhaling (to practice this timing, you can use a secondhand and inhale for five seconds, exhale for five seconds, and repeat four times, or try a guided recording). Paced breathing offers a host of physiological benefits, like reducing your blood pressure, which helps promote a sense of tranquillity. When people tell me it feels challenging to breathe in a certain way when they feel panicked, I tell them to start with alternative soothing activities, like music, and work their way up to paced breathing. Image Practice ‘Anchoring’ Another way to stay present rather than spin into a crisis is to notice if you are engaged in thinking that isn’t helping you. Our interpretations of events supercharge the intensity of our emotions. After all, anticipating, “This will go on for years!” in a moment of anguish will only inspire more hopelessness. But mindfulness, or learning to see more clearly as opposed to jumping to conclusions, is a nice remedy for anxiety. One brief way to enter the moment is known as “anchoring,” a popular strategy. The Coronavirus Outbreak › Frequently Asked Questions Updated August 17, 2020 Why does standing six feet away from others help? The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart. I have antibodies. Am I now immune? As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.

For other districts, the solution won’t be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community. Start by physically centering yourself by digging your heels into the floor — this evokes a feeling of being grounded in reality. Then take a moment to observe: What am I thinking? Feeling in my body? Doing? Then ask yourself: Is my response: A) Helpful? B) Aligned with my values now? Or C) Related to future worries or a past problem? While we can get stuck in specific thoughts, stepping back to more generally decide if those thoughts are helpful can get us out of rumination mode. It may also help to tape a list of these prompts on your computer to remember to take a step back and refocus when your thoughts are only making things worse. Image Hyperventilate If you struggle with physical sensations of anxiety, like muscle tension and feeling like you can’t get enough air, a counterintuitive yet important way to manage is to practice bringing on those sensations in more quiet moments to improve how you tolerate stressful ones. Learning to repeatedly welcome physical symptoms allows you to stop seeing them as catastrophic. In a recent therapy group I led on Zoom, my clients prepared to try this by ordering thin coffee straws. I set my timer for a minute as they pinched their noses and tried to breathe only through the straw. We also worked on replicating the other sensations they associated with fear, like muscle tension, dizziness and shortness of breath. We held a plank, spun in circles and ran in place. Some people were surprised that the practice experience was worse than the anxiety they normally felt. Others found it was similar, which felt liberating — they didn’t have to wait for the feelings to catch them off guard — and instead could purposefully habituate themselves to them. Recently, at the end of a long day of video calls with patients, my 5-year-old daughter asked, “When will the germs go away?” After removing my 3-year-old’s sneaker from my 1-year-old’s mouth, I saw a request from a client about an urgent check-in. I practiced paced breathing and pulled up our nightly dance party playlist (by request: Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling”) before discussing my daughter’s feelings and returning to work. Now I hope you create your own plan with the strategies above. By practicing managing your emotions, you’ll experience a sense of freedom in your life. I don’t know about you, but I’d chase that over any mindless short-term alternative.

Trump should keep that in mind as he pushes for a coronavirus shot. By Rick Perlstein Mr. Perlstein is the author of “Reaganland: America’s Right Turn, 1976-1980.” Sept. 2, 2020 President Gerald Ford announcing a national swine flu immunization program in 1976.Credit...Ricardo Thomas/Gerald R Ford Library, via PhotoQuest -- Getty Images Last week, news arrived that President Trump had lurched into what may be his most reckless obsession yet: His administration would probably seek an “emergency use authorization” for a Covid-19 vaccine long before some scientists believe it would be safe to do so. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services immediately addressed the obvious suspicion: “Talk of an ‘October surprise’”— an attempt to manufacture good news just before the November election — “is a lurid Resistance fantasy.” As he does often, however, the president proudly admitted to the exact thing his underling insisted was inconceivable. “The deep state, or whoever, over at the F.D.A.,” he tweeted recently at Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, “is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after Nov. 3. Must focus on speed and saving lives!” To that end, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has notified public health officials across the country to prepare to distribute a coronavirus vaccine to health care workers and other high-risk groups as soon as late October. The president’s desperate words betray a gamble: Yes, rushing out a vaccine in an emergency may save lives, but it can also jeopardize safety, further erode public confidence in vaccines — and possibly kill. History offers Mr. Trump a cautionary tale. In February 1976, hundreds of soldiers at Fort Dix, N.J., contracted a new strain of the H1N1 virus that seemed to be a descendant of the one responsible for the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed at least 50 million people worldwide and possibly as many as 100 million. Back in those days, the World Health Organization twice a year convened a panel of experts to determine which strains of influenza should be included in that year’s flu shots, then provided the necessary “seed virus” to manufacturers. President Gerald Ford, however, decided to leapfrog the protocol in the face of the news out of Fort Dix. It was, after all, an election year, and Mr. Ford, who had risen to the presidency upon Richard Nixon’s resignation 19 months earlier, was seeking his first full term. On March 22, Mr. Ford met with senior administration officials, who recommended a mass vaccination program. A memo marked “the president has seen” warned of “the ingredients for a pandemic” though also noted that “an argument can be made for taking no extraordinary action.” But Mr. Ford was advised that Congress would likely act anyway — which meant they, not he, would get the credit for a potentially heroic decision — and that the government “can tolerate unnecessary health expenditures better than unnecessary death and illness.” He was also reminded of a significant political consideration: “Congress, the media and the American people will expect some action.” Two days later, he met with a so-called blue ribbon panel of experts and then appeared before television cameras. Telling reporters that “we cannot afford to take a chance with the health of our nation,” he announced that he was requesting an immediate $135 million congressional appropriation “for the production of sufficient vaccine to inoculate every man, woman and child in the United States.” He went on to say that he was directing what was then known as the Department of Health, Education and Welfare “to develop plans that would make this vaccine available to all Americans” in the fall. An unnamed official at the W.H.O., which had not been consulted, expressed his organization’s surprise in widely quoted comments, and noted that “no other countries have plans for mass inoculations” against what was popularly known simply as swine flu. U.S. officials immediately pressured the W.H.O. to endorse Mr. Ford’s decision. And, as the historian George Dehner noted, “The pressure worked: by the next day W.H.O. officials were quoted in the news media as stating, ‘W.H.O. endorses President Ford’s plan for massive inoculation against swine flu virus.’” That fall, celebrities lined up to get jabbed with the vaccine before cameras to set an example — including the president, sleeve rolled up, in the Oval Office. On “Saturday Night Live,” Chevy Chase did his famous Ford impression sporting a syringe in his arm during a debate against Dan Aykroyd’s Jimmy Carter. As it turned out, the H1N1 strain never made it out of Fort Dix, where only one Army recruit died. And, as it also turned out, this swine flu was not nearly as virulent as the 1918 influenza. But fast-tracking the vaccine for broad distribution among the public carried risks. Of the 45 million vaccinated against the swine flu, an estimated 450 people developed the paralyzing syndrome Guillain-Barré and of those, more than 30 died. The National Academy of Medicine subsequently concluded that people who received the 1976 swine flu vaccine had an increased risk for developing Guillain-Barré. The emergence of Guillain-Barré led the government to suspend and effectively end its mass vaccination effort in December. In all, it’s a complicated tale. Were the motivations behind the crash vaccination program political, or a sincere but perhaps misguided sense of urgency about the public health, or a little of both? Philip M. Boffey, a science writer at The New York Times, summed it up this way in an article headlined “Soft Evidence and Hard Sell.” Has the government acted wisely in launching the swine flu inoculation campaign? Reasonable people may reach conflicting answers. Critics consider the program a waste of money, and a potentially dangerous one at that, while proponents call it sound preventive medicine. It’s clear that the scare tactics used to promote the campaign are unwarranted. Many participants in the drama have implied that another 1918 disaster is imminent. Health officials used that fear to help sell the program to their political superiors; President Ford used it to pry funding from Congress and to goad the American public to participate, and the media, ever on the lookout for a compelling news angle, repeatedly stressed the 1918 analogy. The result has been confusion and exaggerated fears that interfere with sound judgment. That said, the very reason Gerald Ford had his job in the first place was that, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in scandal just as the first inklings of the possible impeachment of Richard Nixon were being raised, senators said they would confirm only a vice-presidential appointee who would provide a steady, mature hand on the tiller should he rise to the Oval Office. And that was precisely Gerald Ford’s reputation. If steady, mature Gerald Ford succumbed to haste when his presidency was on the line, imagine what Donald Trump will do. But maybe, just maybe, Mr. Trump can finally learn a lesson from history and move prudently, not impetuously, in rolling out new vaccines for Covid-19. And if that means they come out after the election, so be it. Jerry Ford’s Hail Mary didn’t work, after all: He lost to Jimmy Carter anyway. That’s a history lesson even Donald Trump can understand.

But it would be a tragic mistake to relax our vigilance right away. By Aaron E. Carroll and Nicholas Bagley Mr. Carroll is a professor of pediatrics. Mr. Bagley is a law professor. Nov. 10, 2020 Credit...Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock The announcement that a coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer with the German drugmaker BioNTech is more than 90 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 cases — much better than many anticipated — is cause for celebration. With a vaccine of this efficacy, suppression of the disease is entirely realistic. Unfortunately, this development doesn’t mean we can all relax and start doing more things. It means we need to tighten up even further until the vaccine becomes available. The goal is now no longer to learn to live indefinitely with the virus. It’s to get as many people through the winter as possible without getting sick. Keeping the infection rate low is important, because that’s what will allow us to push the virus into the ground as quickly as possible once we have the vaccine in hand. A death avoided this winter is a life saved. We are no longer delaying the inevitable. It’s always been hard to convince people to make good choices when considering sacrifices. Uncertainty around when we’d get an effective vaccine made it even harder. Cutting off in-person interactions for an uncertain stretch of time was excruciating. But it may be more palatable to hunker down if it’s only for a defined period. To make the situation concrete, let’s consider the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. With cases growing rapidly around the country, especially in the northern Midwest, indoor social gatherings are more dangerous than at any point since the spring. Thanksgiving dinners are ideal settings for “superspreader” events: They crowd people from all over around a table to talk, laugh and drink, often in poorly ventilated rooms. Many families stuff themselves into houses for an entire long weekend. Many of us haven’t seen our extended relatives for months. If we believe this pandemic will be raging for another year — or more — it’s tempting to think that the benefits of reconnecting over Thanksgiving might outweigh the risk of infection. We can’t wait forever; maybe it’s worth rolling the dice. The calculus is very different, however, if a vaccine is around the corner. While Pfizer’s still needs to be approved, manufactured and distributed, the company estimates that 50 million doses could be distributed before the end of the year. Another 1.3 billion would come in 2021. If other vaccines also show success, relief could come as soon as the spring. Assuming this timeline holds, the case for skipping Thanksgiving becomes much stronger. People no longer have to pick between the risk of spreading Covid-19 and the risk of forgoing seeing family for the foreseeable future. They have only to sacrifice seeing them this fall in order to see them much more safely a number of months later. Why not wait? The point generalizes. Without question, the sacrifices required to keep us safe from Covid-19 are costly. And the costs are not just financial; mental health is at risk as well as physical health as people forgo care, including self-care, to remain free from infection. All of that becomes easier to swallow if it’s for a shorter period of time. The changed risk picture also has significant policy implications. As we speak, a nervous Europe has mostly locked itself down again, hoping to stave off the worst effects of a huge surge in infections. Germany, France and England have closed bars, restaurants, gyms and more. For the most part, we haven’t done the same here in the United States, even in states that have been hit hard. Part of that is because our nation’s response to the pandemic has become politicized. But part of it, too, reflects the belief that indefinite business closings are just too costly. Countless small businesses would fail and unemployment would skyrocket. Many argue that we have to live with increased disease because we can’t lock down for years. But mask mandates, gathering restrictions and business closings are more tolerable — and the impositions they require more justifiable — if we have more confidence that they’ll be temporary. By the same token, Pfizer’s announcement strengthens the case for federal financial support. Covid-19 is still going to hurt some businesses disproportionately, either because they’ll be forced to close again or because people have stopped going out as much. But Congress no longer needs to write a blank check to support them. It just needs to provide a lifeline for a number of months, a much more palatable prospect. Providing these resources will have the added benefit of making it politically easier for states to adopt assertive measures to get a handle on case counts that are spiraling out of control. It’s a bad idea for restaurants and bars to be open for indoor dining this winter. Temporarily closing them down would be easier to stomach if these establishments are given the wherewithal to reopen next year. The same is true for aid to individuals who find themselves out of work as the virus-induced economic troubles deepen. Another round of topped-up unemployment insurance doesn’t present the same financial risk to the United States as a never-ending financial obligation to the jobless. The Pfizer announcement is unmitigated good news. But it would be a tragic mistake to relax our vigilance. Instead, continue to mask up, stay home and consider canceling or limiting your Thanksgiving plans. This is still a marathon, but the end is much closer than before.

Training programs are aiming to provide skills for more resilient occupations. Credit...Chloe Cushman By Eduardo Porter Published Dec. 1, 2020Updated Dec. 4, 2020, 8:39 a.m. ET Rob Siminoski has been in the theater, in one way or another, since he graduated from college. But after 10 years at the Universal Studios theme park in California, he is only No. 13 on the stage-managing roster. Even if the park, closed since March, reopens some attractions — the WaterWorld stunt show, say, or the Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle — he is unlikely to be among the first to get the call. His luck is that his union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, offers an apprenticeship program for on-set movie electricians. It takes five years, and Mr. Siminoski, 33, is going to have to brush up his high school algebra to get in. Still, it offers a good balance of risk and reward. “Everyone needs electricity,” he said. “You pull down six figures.” The nation’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will hinge to some extent on how quickly show managers can become electricians, whether taxi drivers can become plumbers, and how many cooks can manage software for a bank. The labor market has recovered 12 million of the 22 million jobs lost from February to April. But many positions may not return any time soon, even when a vaccine is deployed. This is likely to prove especially problematic for millions of low-paid workers in service industries like retailing, hospitality, building maintenance and transportation, which may be permanently impaired or fundamentally transformed. What will janitors do if fewer people work in offices? What will waiters do if the urban restaurant ecosystem never recovers its density? Their prognosis is bleak. Marcela Escobari, an economist at the Brookings Institution, warns that even if the economy adds jobs as the coronavirus risk fades, “the rebound won’t help the people that have been hurt the most.” Looking back over 16 years of data, Ms. Escobari finds that workers in the occupations most heavily hit since the spring will have a difficult time reinventing themselves. Taxi drivers, dancers and front-desk clerks have poor track records moving to jobs as, say, registered nurses, pipe layers or instrumentation technicians. “Many of today’s unemployed workers may find it harder than in the past to find new jobs and advance through the labor market,” Ms. Escobari wrote.

Source: Brookings Institution Covid is abruptly taking out a swath of jobs that were thought to be comparatively resilient, in services that require personal contact with customers. And the jolt has landed squarely on workers with little or no education beyond high school, toiling in the low-wage service economy. “The damage to the economy and particularly to workers will probably be longer lasting than we think it is going to be,” said Peter Beard, senior vice president for regional work force development at the Greater Houston Partnership, an economic development group. What’s more, he said, Covid will intensify underlying dynamics that were already transforming the workplace. Automation, for one, will most likely accelerate as employers seek to protect their businesses from future pandemics. The challenge is not insurmountable. Stephanie Brown, who spent 11 years in the Air Force, found her footing relatively quickly after losing her job as a cook at a hotel in Rochester, Mich., in March. She took advantage of a training program offered by Salesforce, the big software platform for businesses, and got a full-time job in October as a Salesforce administrator for the New York software company Pymetrics from her home in Ann Arbor, Mich. Yet despite scattered success stories, moving millions of workers into new occupations remains an enormous challenge. Jared Sooper is also looking for a change after losing his job last March managing a restaurant in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. Fleeing San Diego’s rents, he and his fiancée packed their things in a U-Haul trailer and relocated to a converted storage space under the deck of her parents’ house near Providence, R.I. Once there, Mr. Sooper, 37, learned of an initiative financed by the state government to train workers displaced by the pandemic and connect them to job opportunities. In November, he finished a five-week program run by Local 51 of the union for the plumbing and pipe fitting trades to become a welder. “2020 seems to be turning around,” Mr. Sooper said. “I’m feeling pretty confident. If they don’t take me for this one, there are others I can apply to.” Still, he couldn’t immediately find a union job as a welder, so for the time being he took a job doing body work for a company that makes eco-friendly bus frames. Derrius Gosha, 30, had been in Los Angeles for only a few months when the pandemic ended his job on the sales floor of Bath and Body Works in February. He is now back at home in Birmingham, Ala., living with his mother and grandmother. John Restrepo, 25, furloughed in March from his job as a server at Tony’s Town Square Restaurant in Disney’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Fla., is sticking it out in an apartment with his two roommates. Barbara Xocoyotl, 57, furloughed in March from her cleaning job at the Omni hotel in New Haven, Conn., had to give up her apartment and is living with a daughter in New York. All are waiting for the economy to restore the jobs they have known. “If there are no retail jobs, I could work at a warehouse, and I’m OK on a conveyor belt,” Mr. Gosha said. “The only thing I wouldn’t want to do is put on a hard hat and go dig a ditch.” After weeks of hunting, he landed a seasonal position in the lawn and garden section at Lowe’s. Often, the old jobs just don’t return at all. As he searches for an opening at CVS, or Walgreens, or another restaurant in town, Mr. Restrepo pins his hope on a deal that his UNITE HERE union local struck with Disney to offer the workers it let go a first crack at jobs once business returns, and retrain them for other Disney jobs if their old positions are terminated. “Thinking optimistically, by the summer of 2022, the majority of us will be able to go back,” he said. Ms. Xocoyotl has a doomsday plan in case the old jobs don’t return: to return to her hometown in central Mexico to be close to her mother. “I’ve been looking for a job, but nobody calls me back, nobody tells me anything,” she said. At her age, she added, “people don’t even ask what one is good for anymore.” Training has always been a challenge for policymakers, and the pandemic complicates matching new skills with jobs. Austin Urick, 31, went back to school after he lost his job last year selling equipment for the oil and gas industry. He enrolled at San Jacinto College near Houston to learn instrumentation and electrical systems. He expects to graduate this month, certified to calibrate and replace gauges and pumps used by oil and gas companies. The industry, however, has suffered during the pandemic. While he has some good leads, his job hunt hasn’t yielded any offers. “It is worrisome,” Mr. Urick said. “But my Plan B is not just oil and gas.” The instrumentation degree can be taken in different directions. “I can work in an elevator company or in a hospital, anywhere that has gauges,” he added. “I can go down the street to Budweiser.” Harris County, where much of Houston sits, lost about 160,000 jobs in the year through September. Using emergency money approved by Congress in the CARES Act, it has enlisted community colleges and nonprofit groups to develop training programs to move 3,000 workers whose jobs were hit by the pandemic into more resilient occupations: plumbing or accounting, nursing or coding. “Work force development was a major priority when I came into the office,” said Adrian Garcia, a county commissioner whose district is among the poorest there. “Now, with the pandemic in our midst, it is critical.” With the training program filling up, he is counting on the county to find money to expand it. And yet at scale, it will be a considerable challenge to assist workers in the transition to a new economy in which many jobs are gone for good and those available often require proficiency in sophisticated digital tools. “We need a New Deal for skills,” said Amit Sevak, president of Revature, a company that hires workers, trains them to use digital tools and helps place them in jobs. “President Roosevelt deployed the massive number of workers unemployed in the Great Depression on projects that created many of the dams and roads and bridges we have. We need something like that.” Rhode Island is using stimulus money from the CARES Act to fund a training initiative that provides additional support for workers — like child care and transportation assistance — and gets commitments from employers to hire trainees. Gov. Gina Raimondo thinks the pandemic offers an opportunity for something similar on a national level. But she acknowledges that this is a heavy lift. “This stuff is easy to say and really hard to do,” she said. “We’re talking about transitioning a whole economy, and transitions are hard.” Mr. Siminoski, for one, is hoping that his transition from theme park stage manager to movie electrician pays off. But while he’s waiting, he still has to put food on the table. So for the immediate future he’s thinking about going to driving school to get a truck driver’s license. “It’s expensive — about $1,600,” he said. “But I think training takes less than a month, and it seems you can get a job right away.” AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Games Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition International Canada Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2020 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions"

Attorney General Asks Courts to Take Action Against Facebook Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who led the multistate investigation into Facebook, called for the courts on Wednesday to stop the company from its “anti-competitive” behavior to protect small businesses. Facebook has been spending its time surveilling users’ personal information and profiting, profiting from it. No company — no company should have this much unchecked power over our personal information and our social interactions. And that’s why we are taking action today, and standing up for the millions of consumers and many small businesses that have been harmed by Facebook’s illegal behavior. So we are asking the court to halt Facebook’s anti-competitive conduct and block the company from continuing this behavior in the future, as well as provide any additional relief it determines is appropriate. By restoring competition, our lawsuit will help consumers have alternatives to Facebook, and that they can vote with their feet. Today, we are sending a clear and a strong message to Facebook and every other company that any efforts to stifle competition and hurt small businesses, reduce innovation and creativity or cut pricey protections — privacy protections — will be met with the full force of our offices. Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who led the multistate investigation into Facebook, called for the courts on Wednesday to stop the company from its “anti-competitive” behavior to protect small businesses.CreditCredit...via New York State Attorney General's Office By Cecilia Kang and Mike Isaac Dec. 9, 2020 WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission and more than 40 states accused Facebook on Wednesday of buying up its rivals to illegally squash competition, and they called for the deals to be unwound, escalating regulators’ battle against the biggest tech companies in a way that could remake the social media industry. Federal and state regulators of both parties, who have investigated the company for over 18 months, said in separate lawsuits that Facebook’s purchases, especially Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion two years later, eliminated competition that could have one day challenged the company’s dominance. Since those deals, Instagram and WhatsApp have skyrocketed in popularity, giving Facebook control over three of the world’s most popular social media and messaging apps. The applications have helped catapult Facebook from a company started in a college dorm room 16 years ago to an internet powerhouse valued at more than $800 billion. The lawsuits, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, underscore the growing bipartisan and international tsunami against Big Tech. Lawmakers and regulators have zeroed in on the grip that Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple maintain on commerce, electronics, social networking, search and online advertising, remaking the nation’s economy. President Trump has argued repeatedly that the tech giants have too much power and influence, and allies of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. make similar complaints. The federal case against Facebook is widely expected to continue under Mr. Biden’s administration. The investigations already led to a lawsuit against Google, brought by the Justice Department two months ago, that accuses the search giant of illegally protecting a monopoly. Prosecutors in that case, though, stopped short of demanding that Google break off any parts of its business. At least one more suit against Google, by both Republican and Democratic officials, is expected by the end of the year. In Europe, regulators are proposing tougher laws against the industry and have issued billions of dollars in penalties for the violation of competition laws. Facebook, the prosecutors said Wednesday, should break off Instagram and WhatsApp, and they said new restrictions should apply to the company on future deals. Those are some of the most severe penalties regulators can demand. Facebook said it planned to vigorously defend itself against the accusations. “For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,” said Attorney General Letitia James of New York, a Democrat who led the multistate investigation into the company in parallel with the federal agency, which is overseen by a Republican. Image Joe Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which has been investigating Facebook since last year. Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times The lawsuits against Facebook will set off a long legal battle. The company has long denied any illegal anticompetitive behavior and has a deep well of money to put toward its defense. Few major antitrust cases have centered on mergers approved years earlier. The F.T.C. did not block Facebook’s deals for Instagram and WhatsApp during the Obama administration. If the prosecutors succeed, the cases could remake the company, which has experienced only unfettered growth. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has described a breakup of the company as an “existential” threat. The company’s stock fell 2 percent, to $277.70 a share, after the lawsuits were announced. The case is also being widely watched as a gauge for future mergers within the technology industry, which have continued to boom during the pandemic. Last month, Facebook said it was buying Kustomer, a customer relationship management start-up, for close to $1 billion. Facebook said the regulators had ignored important history. “The most important fact in this case, which the commission does not mention in its 53-page complaint, is that it cleared these acquisitions years ago,” Jennifer Newstead, Facebook’s general counsel, said in a statement. “The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final.” The company has also argued in the past that the market for social media remained competitive. Executives have pointed to the skyrocketing growth of TikTok, the Chinese short-video sharing app, and new growth in Parler, a social media firm popular among conservatives, as evidence that Facebook doesn’t have a lock on social networking. The suit against Facebook shows how important the company has become for how Americans connect to one another. Its namesake product swelled to hundreds of millions of users in just a few short years. But by 2011, the landscape began to change as mobile phones came equipped with capable cameras, and posting photos to social networks grew increasingly popular. That led to the rise of a competitive threat to Facebook: Instagram. The photo-sharing site, founded in 2010, saw early explosive growth as a company that was native to the smartphone, perfectly timed for mass adoption as waves of consumers gravitated away from desktop devices and toward the mobile computers in their pockets. The F.T.C. said it found that Mr. Zuckerberg “recognized Instagram as a vibrant and innovative personal social network and an existential threat to Facebook’s monopoly power.” But instead of continuing to compete with its own photo-sharing project, Facebook chose to buy its rival. The company repeated the practice with WhatsApp, which was a viable competitor to its own messaging system. The agency also claims that Facebook maintained its dominance by threatening to cut off third-party software developers from plugging into the social network if they made competing products. “Our aim,” said Ian Conner, who oversees antitrust enforcement at the agency, “is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.” The lawsuits set off a chorus of bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. “Facebook has crushed competition by breaking the law,” Representative Ken Buck, a Republican of Colorado and member of the House judiciary committee, wrote on Twitter. “Big Tech’s reckoning has just begun.” Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who led an investigation into the big tech companies, said: “Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up.” He added, “This marks a major step in our ongoing work to bring the tech industry’s monopoly moment to an end.” Federal regulators began looking into Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in June 2019, in a sweeping effort to find anticompetitive practices among the tech platforms. States started to investigate not long after. Cases around Google and Facebook, two companies with clear dominance in their markets of search, social media and online advertising, took shape faster than those against the other companies. Google had been the subject of a search antitrust investigation that closed at the F.T.C. in 2013 without a lawsuit but created a trove of information. Facebook’s case quickly coalesced around its prior mergers, which regulators were able to investigate because of its past investigations into those acquisitions, some people close to the investigations said. The F.T.C. was split on its decision to pursue the lawsuit, with its chairman, Joseph Simons, a Republican appointed by Mr. Trump, and the two Democratic commissioners joined in their vote. The two remaining Republican commissioners voted against the lawsuit. The state suit was signed by attorneys general from 46 states and the District of Columbia and Guam. Georgia, South Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina did not join the case. There is a history of states going after large tech companies. In the landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft two decades ago, state attorneys general played a crucial role in pushing the case through years of litigation. Several Facebook rivals, including Snap, came forward to present evidence of what they said was anticompetitive behavior. Mr. Zuckerberg was interviewed for the federal investigation, and prosecutors collected many of his communications to Facebook employees, investors and the leaders of the rivals he bought and tried to buy. In a hearing before the House judiciary committee last July, Mr. Zuckerberg was confronted with emails from around the time of the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp that showed the Facebook founder saw the companies as competition and potentially a threat. Mr. Zuckerberg said that the acquisitions have not reduced competition and that the emails were taken out of context. The agency and states said the purchases ended up giving Facebook data on users that fed into its business of behavioral advertising, buttressing its monopoly. “Facebook has coupled its acquisition strategy with exclusionary tactics that snuffed out competitive threats,” the states said in their suit, “and sent the message to technology firms that, in the words of one participant, if you stepped into Facebook’s turf or resisted pressure to sell, Zuckerberg would go into ‘destroy mode,’ subjecting your business to the ‘wrath of Mark.’” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

The family started the business to provide refreshments to weary travelers coming from across Japan to pray for pandemic relief — in the year 1000. Now, more than a millennium later, a new disease has devastated the economy in the ancient capital, as its once reliable stream of tourists has evaporated. But Ms. Hasegawa is not concerned about her enterprise’s finances. Like many businesses in Japan, her family’s shop, Ichiwa, takes the long view — albeit longer than most. By putting tradition and stability over profit and growth, Ichiwa has weathered wars, plagues, natural disasters, and the rise and fall of empires. Through it all, its rice flour cakes have remained the same. Image Naomi Hasegawa is the operator of Ichiwa. Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Such enterprises may be less dynamic than those in other countries. But their resilience offers lessons for businesses in places like the United States, where the coronavirus has forced tens of thousands into bankruptcy. “If you look at the economics textbooks, enterprises are supposed to be maximizing profits, scaling up their size, market share and growth rate. But these companies’ operating principles are completely different,” said Kenji Matsuoka, a professor emeritus of business at Ryukoku University in Kyoto. “Their No. 1 priority is carrying on,” he added. “Each generation is like a runner in a relay race. What’s important is passing the baton.” Japan is an old-business superpower. The country is home to more than 33,000 with at least 100 years of history — over 40 percent of the world’s total, according to a study by the Tokyo-based Research Institute of Centennial Management. Over 3,100 have been running for at least two centuries. Around 140 have existed for more than 500 years. And at least 19 claim to have been continuously operating since the first millennium. Image Kyoto, seen from a park near Ichiwa. More than 33,000 businesses in Japan have been open for a century or more. Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times (Some of the oldest companies, including Ichiwa, cannot definitively trace their history back to their founding, but their timelines are accepted by the government, scholars and — in Ichiwa’s case — the competing mochi shop across the street.) The businesses, known as “shinise,” are a source of both pride and fascination. Regional governments promote their products. Business management books explain the secrets of their success. And entire travel guides are devoted to them. Most of these old businesses are, like Ichiwa, small, family-run enterprises that deal in traditional goods and services. But some are among Japan’s most famous companies, including Nintendo, which got its start making playing cards 131 years ago, and the soy sauce brand Kikkoman, which has been around since 1917. To survive for a millennium, Ms. Hasegawa said, a business cannot just chase profits. It has to have a higher purpose.

They look after their employees, support the community and strive to make a product that inspires pride. For Ichiwa, that means doing one thing and doing it well — a very Japanese approach to business. The company has declined many opportunities to expand, including, most recently, a request from Uber Eats to start online delivery. Mochi remains the only item on the menu, and if you want something to drink, you are politely offered the choice of roasted green tea.

They boiled the rice in the water from a small spring that burbles into the shop’s cellar, pounded it into a paste and then shaped it into balls that they gently toasted on wooden skewers over a small cast-iron hibachi. The rice’s caramelized skin is brushed with sweet miso paste and served to the shrine’s visitors hot, before the delicate treat cools and turns tough and chewy.

The local health department has forbidden the use of well water. A mochi machine hidden in the kitchen mechanically pounds the rice, saving a few hours of work each morning. And, after centuries of operating on the honor system, it charges a fixed price per plate, a change it instituted sometime after World War II as the business began to pay more attention to its finances. Business & Economy Latest Updates Updated Dec. 11, 2020, 12:33 p.m. ET A surprise savior for Britain’s pubs: Scotch eggs. Stocks dip as Brexit and U.S. stimulus talks remain stuck with time running out. Pound suffers its worst week in three months as yet another Brexit deadline nears. The Japanese companies that have endured the longest have often been defined by an aversion to risk — shaped in part by past crises — and an accumulation of large cash reserves. It is a common trait among Japanese enterprises and part of the reason that the country has so far avoided the high bankruptcy rates of the United States during the pandemic. Even when they “make some profits,” said Tomohiro Ota, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, “they do not increase their capital expenditure.” Image The honor system sustained Ichiwa for hundreds of years until prices were introduced after World War II.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Large enterprises in particular keep substantial reserves to ensure that they can continue issuing paychecks and meet their other financial obligations in the event of an economic downturn or a crisis. But even smaller businesses tend to have low debt levels and an average of one to two months of operating expenses on hand, Mr. Ota said. When they do need support, financing is cheap and readily available. Interest rates in Japan have been low for decades, and a government stimulus package introduced in response to the pandemic has effectively zeroed them out for most small enterprises. Small shinise often own their own facilities and rely on members of the family to help keep payroll costs down, allowing them to stockpile cash. When Toshio Goto, a professor at the Japan University of Economics Graduate School and representative director of the Research Institute of Centennial Management, conducted a survey this summer of companies that are at least 100 years old, more than a quarter said they had enough funds on hand to operate for two years or longer. Still, that does not mean they are frozen in time. Many started during the 200-year period, beginning in the 17th century, when Japan largely sealed itself off from the outside world, providing a stable business environment. But over the last century, survival has increasingly meant finding a balance between preserving traditions and adapting to quickly changing market conditions. Image Workers cleaning Ichiwa at the end of a day. Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times For some companies, that has meant updating their core business. NBK, a materials firm that started off making iron kettles in 1560, is now producing high-tech machine parts. Hosoo, a 332-year-old kimono manufacturer in Kyoto, has expanded its textile business into home furnishings and even electronics. For others, keeping up with the times can be hard, especially those, like Tanaka Iga Butsugu, that are essentially selling tradition itself. Tanaka Iga has been making Buddhist religious goods in Kyoto since 885. It is famous for what its 70th-generation president, Masaichi Tanaka, jokingly refers to as the “Mercedes-Benz” of butsudan — household shrines that can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Image Masaichi Tanaka is the president of Tanaka Iga Butsugu, a religious-goods manufacturer in Kyoto since 885.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times The pandemic has been “tough,” he said, but the biggest challenges faced by his company, and many others, are Japan’s aging society and changing tastes. Some companies have closed because the owners could not find a successor. For Mr. Tanaka, it is getting harder and harder to replace skilled traditional workers. Business is crimped because fewer people nowadays go to the temples he supplies. And new homes are rarely built with a place to put a butsudan, which normally occupies its own special nook in a traditional Japanese-style room with tatami flooring and sliding paper doors. When it comes to religious tradition, there is little room for innovation, Mr. Tanaka said. Many of his products’ designs are nearly as old as the company. He has considered incorporating 3-D printers into his business, but he wonders who’s going to buy items made with one. Image Katsuya Ikeda repairing a part of a Buddhist shrine at Tanaka Iga.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Ichiwa is blissfully untroubled by such concerns. The family is large, the business is small, and the only special skill needed to grill the mochi is a high tolerance for blistering heat. But Ms. Hasegawa, 60, admits she sometimes feels the pressure of the shop’s history. Even though the business doesn’t provide much of a living, everyone in the family from a young age “was warned that as long as one of us was still alive, we needed to carry on,” she said. One reason “we keep going,” she added, is “because we all hate the idea of being the one to let it go.” Image The east gate of Imamiya Shrine, just steps away from Ichiwa.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Games Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition International Canada Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2020 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions"

Training programs are aiming to provide skills for more resilient occupations. Credit...Chloe Cushman By Eduardo Porter Published Dec. 1, 2020Updated Dec. 4, 2020 Rob Siminoski has been in the theater, in one way or another, since he graduated from college. But after 10 years at the Universal Studios theme park in California, he is only No. 13 on the stage-managing roster. Even if the park, closed since March, reopens some attractions — the WaterWorld stunt show, say, or the Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle — he is unlikely to be among the first to get the call. His luck is that his union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, offers an apprenticeship program for on-set movie electricians. It takes five years, and Mr. Siminoski, 33, is going to have to brush up his high school algebra to get in. Still, it offers a good balance of risk and reward. “Everyone needs electricity,” he said. “You pull down six figures.” The nation’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will hinge to some extent on how quickly show managers can become electricians, whether taxi drivers can become plumbers, and how many cooks can manage software for a bank. The labor market has recovered 12 million of the 22 million jobs lost from February to April. But many positions may not return any time soon, even when a vaccine is deployed. This is likely to prove especially problematic for millions of low-paid workers in service industries like retailing, hospitality, building maintenance and transportation, which may be permanently impaired or fundamentally transformed. What will janitors do if fewer people work in offices? What will waiters do if the urban restaurant ecosystem never recovers its density? Their prognosis is bleak. Marcela Escobari, an economist at the Brookings Institution, warns that even if the economy adds jobs as the coronavirus risk fades, “the rebound won’t help the people that have been hurt the most.” Looking back over 16 years of data, Ms. Escobari finds that workers in the occupations most heavily hit since the spring will have a difficult time reinventing themselves. Taxi drivers, dancers and front-desk clerks have poor track records moving to jobs as, say, registered nurses, pipe layers or instrumentation technicians. “Many of today’s unemployed workers may find it harder than in the past to find new jobs and advance through the labor market,” Ms. Escobari wrote.

Source: Brookings Institution Covid is abruptly taking out a swath of jobs that were thought to be comparatively resilient, in services that require personal contact with customers. And the jolt has landed squarely on workers with little or no education beyond high school, toiling in the low-wage service economy. “The damage to the economy and particularly to workers will probably be longer lasting than we think it is going to be,” said Peter Beard, senior vice president for regional work force development at the Greater Houston Partnership, an economic development group. What’s more, he said, Covid will intensify underlying dynamics that were already transforming the workplace. Automation, for one, will most likely accelerate as employers seek to protect their businesses from future pandemics. The challenge is not insurmountable. Stephanie Brown, who spent 11 years in the Air Force, found her footing relatively quickly after losing her job as a cook at a hotel in Rochester, Mich., in March. She took advantage of a training program offered by Salesforce, the big software platform for businesses, and got a full-time job in October as a Salesforce administrator for the New York software company Pymetrics from her home in Ann Arbor, Mich. Yet despite scattered success stories, moving millions of workers into new occupations remains an enormous challenge. Jared Sooper is also looking for a change after losing his job last March managing a restaurant in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. Fleeing San Diego’s rents, he and his fiancée packed their things in a U-Haul trailer and relocated to a converted storage space under the deck of her parents’ house near Providence, R.I. Once there, Mr. Sooper, 37, learned of an initiative financed by the state government to train workers displaced by the pandemic and connect them to job opportunities. In November, he finished a five-week program run by Local 51 of the union for the plumbing and pipe fitting trades to become a welder. “2020 seems to be turning around,” Mr. Sooper said. “I’m feeling pretty confident. If they don’t take me for this one, there are others I can apply to.” Still, he couldn’t immediately find a union job as a welder, so for the time being he took a job doing body work for a company that makes eco-friendly bus frames. Business & Economy Latest Updates Updated Dec. 11, 2020, 12:33 p.m. ET A surprise savior for Britain’s pubs: Scotch eggs. Stocks dip as Brexit and U.S. stimulus talks remain stuck with time running out. Pound suffers its worst week in three months as yet another Brexit deadline nears. Derrius Gosha, 30, had been in Los Angeles for only a few months when the pandemic ended his job on the sales floor of Bath and Body Works in February. He is now back at home in Birmingham, Ala., living with his mother and grandmother. John Restrepo, 25, furloughed in March from his job as a server at Tony’s Town Square Restaurant in Disney’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Fla., is sticking it out in an apartment with his two roommates. Barbara Xocoyotl, 57, furloughed in March from her cleaning job at the Omni hotel in New Haven, Conn., had to give up her apartment and is living with a daughter in New York. All are waiting for the economy to restore the jobs they have known. “If there are no retail jobs, I could work at a warehouse, and I’m OK on a conveyor belt,” Mr. Gosha said. “The only thing I wouldn’t want to do is put on a hard hat and go dig a ditch.” After weeks of hunting, he landed a seasonal position in the lawn and garden section at Lowe’s. Often, the old jobs just don’t return at all. As he searches for an opening at CVS, or Walgreens, or another restaurant in town, Mr. Restrepo pins his hope on a deal that his UNITE HERE union local struck with Disney to offer the workers it let go a first crack at jobs once business returns, and retrain them for other Disney jobs if their old positions are terminated. “Thinking optimistically, by the summer of 2022, the majority of us will be able to go back,” he said. Ms. Xocoyotl has a doomsday plan in case the old jobs don’t return: to return to her hometown in central Mexico to be close to her mother. “I’ve been looking for a job, but nobody calls me back, nobody tells me anything,” she said. At her age, she added, “people don’t even ask what one is good for anymore.” Training has always been a challenge for policymakers, and the pandemic complicates matching new skills with jobs. Austin Urick, 31, went back to school after he lost his job last year selling equipment for the oil and gas industry. He enrolled at San Jacinto College near Houston to learn instrumentation and electrical systems. He expects to graduate this month, certified to calibrate and replace gauges and pumps used by oil and gas companies. The industry, however, has suffered during the pandemic. While he has some good leads, his job hunt hasn’t yielded any offers. “It is worrisome,” Mr. Urick said. “But my Plan B is not just oil and gas.” The instrumentation degree can be taken in different directions. “I can work in an elevator company or in a hospital, anywhere that has gauges,” he added. “I can go down the street to Budweiser.” Harris County, where much of Houston sits, lost about 160,000 jobs in the year through September. Using emergency money approved by Congress in the CARES Act, it has enlisted community colleges and nonprofit groups to develop training programs to move 3,000 workers whose jobs were hit by the pandemic into more resilient occupations: plumbing or accounting, nursing or coding. “Work force development was a major priority when I came into the office,” said Adrian Garcia, a county commissioner whose district is among the poorest there. “Now, with the pandemic in our midst, it is critical.” With the training program filling up, he is counting on the county to find money to expand it. And yet at scale, it will be a considerable challenge to assist workers in the transition to a new economy in which many jobs are gone for good and those available often require proficiency in sophisticated digital tools. “We need a New Deal for skills,” said Amit Sevak, president of Revature, a company that hires workers, trains them to use digital tools and helps place them in jobs. “President Roosevelt deployed the massive number of workers unemployed in the Great Depression on projects that created many of the dams and roads and bridges we have. We need something like that.” Rhode Island is using stimulus money from the CARES Act to fund a training initiative that provides additional support for workers — like child care and transportation assistance — and gets commitments from employers to hire trainees. Gov. Gina Raimondo thinks the pandemic offers an opportunity for something similar on a national level. But she acknowledges that this is a heavy lift. “This stuff is easy to say and really hard to do,” she said. “We’re talking about transitioning a whole economy, and transitions are hard.” Mr. Siminoski, for one, is hoping that his transition from theme park stage manager to movie electrician pays off. But while he’s waiting, he still has to put food on the table. So for the immediate future he’s thinking about going to driving school to get a truck driver’s license. “It’s expensive — about $1,600,” he said. “But I think training takes less than a month, and it seems you can get a job right away.” AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Games Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition International Canada Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2020 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions"

Attorney General Asks Courts to Take Action Against Facebook Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who led the multistate investigation into Facebook, called for the courts on Wednesday to stop the company from its “anti-competitive” behavior to protect small businesses. Facebook has been spending its time surveilling users’ personal information and profiting, profiting from it. No company — no company should have this much unchecked power over our personal information and our social interactions. And that’s why we are taking action today, and standing up for the millions of consumers and many small businesses that have been harmed by Facebook’s illegal behavior. So we are asking the court to halt Facebook’s anti-competitive conduct and block the company from continuing this behavior in the future, as well as provide any additional relief it determines is appropriate. By restoring competition, our lawsuit will help consumers have alternatives to Facebook, and that they can vote with their feet. Today, we are sending a clear and a strong message to Facebook and every other company that any efforts to stifle competition and hurt small businesses, reduce innovation and creativity or cut pricey protections — privacy protections — will be met with the full force of our offices. Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who led the multistate investigation into Facebook, called for the courts on Wednesday to stop the company from its “anti-competitive” behavior to protect small businesses.CreditCredit...via New York State Attorney General's Office By Cecilia Kang and Mike Isaac Dec. 9, 2020 WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission and more than 40 states accused Facebook on Wednesday of buying up its rivals to illegally squash competition, and they called for the deals to be unwound, escalating regulators’ battle against the biggest tech companies in a way that could remake the social media industry. Federal and state regulators of both parties, who have investigated the company for over 18 months, said in separate lawsuits that Facebook’s purchases, especially Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion two years later, eliminated competition that could have one day challenged the company’s dominance. Since those deals, Instagram and WhatsApp have skyrocketed in popularity, giving Facebook control over three of the world’s most popular social media and messaging apps. The applications have helped catapult Facebook from a company started in a college dorm room 16 years ago to an internet powerhouse valued at more than $800 billion. The lawsuits, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, underscore the growing bipartisan and international tsunami against Big Tech. Lawmakers and regulators have zeroed in on the grip that Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple maintain on commerce, electronics, social networking, search and online advertising, remaking the nation’s economy. President Trump has argued repeatedly that the tech giants have too much power and influence, and allies of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. make similar complaints. The federal case against Facebook is widely expected to continue under Mr. Biden’s administration. The investigations already led to a lawsuit against Google, brought by the Justice Department two months ago, that accuses the search giant of illegally protecting a monopoly. Prosecutors in that case, though, stopped short of demanding that Google break off any parts of its business. At least one more suit against Google, by both Republican and Democratic officials, is expected by the end of the year. In Europe, regulators are proposing tougher laws against the industry and have issued billions of dollars in penalties for the violation of competition laws. Facebook, the prosecutors said Wednesday, should break off Instagram and WhatsApp, and they said new restrictions should apply to the company on future deals. Those are some of the most severe penalties regulators can demand. Facebook said it planned to vigorously defend itself against the accusations. “For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,” said Attorney General Letitia James of New York, a Democrat who led the multistate investigation into the company in parallel with the federal agency, which is overseen by a Republican. Image Joe Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which has been investigating Facebook since last year. Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times The lawsuits against Facebook will set off a long legal battle. The company has long denied any illegal anticompetitive behavior and has a deep well of money to put toward its defense. Few major antitrust cases have centered on mergers approved years earlier. The F.T.C. did not block Facebook’s deals for Instagram and WhatsApp during the Obama administration. If the prosecutors succeed, the cases could remake the company, which has experienced only unfettered growth. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has described a breakup of the company as an “existential” threat. The company’s stock fell 2 percent, to $277.70 a share, after the lawsuits were announced. The case is also being widely watched as a gauge for future mergers within the technology industry, which have continued to boom during the pandemic. Last month, Facebook said it was buying Kustomer, a customer relationship management start-up, for close to $1 billion. Facebook said the regulators had ignored important history. “The most important fact in this case, which the commission does not mention in its 53-page complaint, is that it cleared these acquisitions years ago,” Jennifer Newstead, Facebook’s general counsel, said in a statement. “The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final.” The company has also argued in the past that the market for social media remained competitive. Executives have pointed to the skyrocketing growth of TikTok, the Chinese short-video sharing app, and new growth in Parler, a social media firm popular among conservatives, as evidence that Facebook doesn’t have a lock on social networking. The suit against Facebook shows how important the company has become for how Americans connect to one another. Its namesake product swelled to hundreds of millions of users in just a few short years. But by 2011, the landscape began to change as mobile phones came equipped with capable cameras, and posting photos to social networks grew increasingly popular. That led to the rise of a competitive threat to Facebook: Instagram. The photo-sharing site, founded in 2010, saw early explosive growth as a company that was native to the smartphone, perfectly timed for mass adoption as waves of consumers gravitated away from desktop devices and toward the mobile computers in their pockets. The F.T.C. said it found that Mr. Zuckerberg “recognized Instagram as a vibrant and innovative personal social network and an existential threat to Facebook’s monopoly power.” But instead of continuing to compete with its own photo-sharing project, Facebook chose to buy its rival. The company repeated the practice with WhatsApp, which was a viable competitor to its own messaging system. The agency also claims that Facebook maintained its dominance by threatening to cut off third-party software developers from plugging into the social network if they made competing products. “Our aim,” said Ian Conner, who oversees antitrust enforcement at the agency, “is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.” The lawsuits set off a chorus of bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. “Facebook has crushed competition by breaking the law,” Representative Ken Buck, a Republican of Colorado and member of the House judiciary committee, wrote on Twitter. “Big Tech’s reckoning has just begun.” Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who led an investigation into the big tech companies, said: “Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up.” He added, “This marks a major step in our ongoing work to bring the tech industry’s monopoly moment to an end.” Federal regulators began looking into Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in June 2019, in a sweeping effort to find anticompetitive practices among the tech platforms. States started to investigate not long after. Cases around Google and Facebook, two companies with clear dominance in their markets of search, social media and online advertising, took shape faster than those against the other companies. Google had been the subject of a search antitrust investigation that closed at the F.T.C. in 2013 without a lawsuit but created a trove of information. Facebook’s case quickly coalesced around its prior mergers, which regulators were able to investigate because of its past investigations into those acquisitions, some people close to the investigations said. The F.T.C. was split on its decision to pursue the lawsuit, with its chairman, Joseph Simons, a Republican appointed by Mr. Trump, and the two Democratic commissioners joined in their vote. The two remaining Republican commissioners voted against the lawsuit. The state suit was signed by attorneys general from 46 states and the District of Columbia and Guam. Georgia, South Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina did not join the case. There is a history of states going after large tech companies. In the landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft two decades ago, state attorneys general played a crucial role in pushing the case through years of litigation. Several Facebook rivals, including Snap, came forward to present evidence of what they said was anticompetitive behavior. Mr. Zuckerberg was interviewed for the federal investigation, and prosecutors collected many of his communications to Facebook employees, investors and the leaders of the rivals he bought and tried to buy. In a hearing before the House judiciary committee last July, Mr. Zuckerberg was confronted with emails from around the time of the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp that showed the Facebook founder saw the companies as competition and potentially a threat. Mr. Zuckerberg said that the acquisitions have not reduced competition and that the emails were taken out of context. The agency and states said the purchases ended up giving Facebook data on users that fed into its business of behavioral advertising, buttressing its monopoly. “Facebook has coupled its acquisition strategy with exclusionary tactics that snuffed out competitive threats,” the states said in their suit, “and sent the message to technology firms that, in the words of one participant, if you stepped into Facebook’s turf or resisted pressure to sell, Zuckerberg would go into ‘destroy mode,’ subjecting your business to the ‘wrath of Mark.’” Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

The family started the business to provide refreshments to weary travelers coming from across Japan to pray for pandemic relief — in the year 1000. Now, more than a millennium later, a new disease has devastated the economy in the ancient capital, as its once reliable stream of tourists has evaporated. But Ms. Hasegawa is not concerned about her enterprise’s finances. Like many businesses in Japan, her family’s shop, Ichiwa, takes the long view — albeit longer than most. By putting tradition and stability over profit and growth, Ichiwa has weathered wars, plagues, natural disasters, and the rise and fall of empires. Through it all, its rice flour cakes have remained the same. Image Naomi Hasegawa is the operator of Ichiwa. Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Such enterprises may be less dynamic than those in other countries. But their resilience offers lessons for businesses in places like the United States, where the coronavirus has forced tens of thousands into bankruptcy. “If you look at the economics textbooks, enterprises are supposed to be maximizing profits, scaling up their size, market share and growth rate. But these companies’ operating principles are completely different,” said Kenji Matsuoka, a professor emeritus of business at Ryukoku University in Kyoto. “Their No. 1 priority is carrying on,” he added. “Each generation is like a runner in a relay race. What’s important is passing the baton.” Japan is an old-business superpower. The country is home to more than 33,000 with at least 100 years of history — over 40 percent of the world’s total, according to a study by the Tokyo-based Research Institute of Centennial Management. Over 3,100 have been running for at least two centuries. Around 140 have existed for more than 500 years. And at least 19 claim to have been continuously operating since the first millennium.

Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times (Some of the oldest companies, including Ichiwa, cannot definitively trace their history back to their founding, but their timelines are accepted by the government, scholars and — in Ichiwa’s case — the competing mochi shop across the street.) The businesses, known as “shinise,” are a source of both pride and fascination. Regional governments promote their products. Business management books explain the secrets of their success. And entire travel guides are devoted to them. Most of these old businesses are, like Ichiwa, small, family-run enterprises that deal in traditional goods and services. But some are among Japan’s most famous companies, including Nintendo, which got its start making playing cards 131 years ago, and the soy sauce brand Kikkoman, which has been around since 1917. To survive for a millennium, Ms. Hasegawa said, a business cannot just chase profits. It has to have a higher purpose. In the case of Ichiwa, that was a religious calling: serving the shrine’s pilgrims. Image Ichiwa began as a way of serving pilgrims to a nearby shrine.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Those kinds of core values, known as “kakun,” or family precepts, have guided many companies’ business decisions through the generations. They look after their employees, support the community and strive to make a product that inspires pride. For Ichiwa, that means doing one thing and doing it well — a very Japanese approach to business. The company has declined many opportunities to expand, including, most recently, a request from Uber Eats to start online delivery. Mochi remains the only item on the menu, and if you want something to drink, you are politely offered the choice of roasted green tea.

They boiled the rice in the water from a small spring that burbles into the shop’s cellar, pounded it into a paste and then shaped it into balls that they gently toasted on wooden skewers over a small cast-iron hibachi.

The local health department has forbidden the use of well water. A mochi machine hidden in the kitchen mechanically pounds the rice, saving a few hours of work each morning. And, after centuries of operating on the honor system, it charges a fixed price per plate, a change it instituted sometime after World War II as the business began to pay more attention to its finances. The Japanese companies that have endured the longest have often been defined by an aversion to risk — shaped in part by past crises — and an accumulation of large cash reserves. It is a common trait among Japanese enterprises and part of the reason that the country has so far avoided the high bankruptcy rates of the United States during the pandemic. Even when they “make some profits,” said Tomohiro Ota, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, “they do not increase their capital expenditure.” Image The honor system sustained Ichiwa for hundreds of years until prices were introduced after World War II.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Large enterprises in particular keep substantial reserves to ensure that they can continue issuing paychecks and meet their other financial obligations in the event of an economic downturn or a crisis. But even smaller businesses tend to have low debt levels and an average of one to two months of operating expenses on hand, Mr. Ota said. When they do need support, financing is cheap and readily available. Interest rates in Japan have been low for decades, and a government stimulus package introduced in response to the pandemic has effectively zeroed them out for most small enterprises. Small shinise often own their own facilities and rely on members of the family to help keep payroll costs down, allowing them to stockpile cash. When Toshio Goto, a professor at the Japan University of Economics Graduate School and representative director of the Research Institute of Centennial Management, conducted a survey this summer of companies that are at least 100 years old, more than a quarter said they had enough funds on hand to operate for two years or longer. Still, that does not mean they are frozen in time. Many started during the 200-year period, beginning in the 17th century, when Japan largely sealed itself off from the outside world, providing a stable business environment. But over the last century, survival has increasingly meant finding a balance between preserving traditions and adapting to quickly changing market conditions. Image Workers cleaning Ichiwa at the end of a day. Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times For some companies, that has meant updating their core business. NBK, a materials firm that started off making iron kettles in 1560, is now producing high-tech machine parts. Hosoo, a 332-year-old kimono manufacturer in Kyoto, has expanded its textile business into home furnishings and even electronics. For others, keeping up with the times can be hard, especially those, like Tanaka Iga Butsugu, that are essentially selling tradition itself. Tanaka Iga has been making Buddhist religious goods in Kyoto since 885. It is famous for what its 70th-generation president, Masaichi Tanaka, jokingly refers to as the “Mercedes-Benz” of butsudan — household shrines that can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Image Masaichi Tanaka is the president of Tanaka Iga Butsugu, a religious-goods manufacturer in Kyoto since 885.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times The pandemic has been “tough,” he said, but the biggest challenges faced by his company, and many others, are Japan’s aging society and changing tastes. Some companies have closed because the owners could not find a successor. For Mr. Tanaka, it is getting harder and harder to replace skilled traditional workers. Business is crimped because fewer people nowadays go to the temples he supplies. And new homes are rarely built with a place to put a butsudan, which normally occupies its own special nook in a traditional Japanese-style room with tatami flooring and sliding paper doors. When it comes to religious tradition, there is little room for innovation, Mr. Tanaka said. Many of his products’ designs are nearly as old as the company. He has considered incorporating 3-D printers into his business, but he wonders who’s going to buy items made with one. Image Katsuya Ikeda repairing a part of a Buddhist shrine at Tanaka Iga.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Ichiwa is blissfully untroubled by such concerns. The family is large, the business is small, and the only special skill needed to grill the mochi is a high tolerance for blistering heat. But Ms. Hasegawa, 60, admits she sometimes feels the pressure of the shop’s history. Even though the business doesn’t provide much of a living, everyone in the family from a young age “was warned that as long as one of us was still alive, we needed to carry on,” she said. One reason “we keep going,” she added, is “because we all hate the idea of being the one to let it go.” Image The east gate of Imamiya Shrine, just steps away from Ichiwa.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics Election Results New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Games Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition International Canada Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2020 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions"

One afternoon in December 2019, Kathleen Langer, an elderly grandmother who lives by herself in Crossville, Tenn., got a phone call from a person who said he worked in the refund department of her computer manufacturer. The reason for the call, he explained, was to process a refund the company owed Langer for antivirus and anti-hacking protection that had been sold to her and was now being discontinued. Langer, who has a warm and kind voice, couldn’t remember purchasing the plan in question, but at her age, she didn’t quite trust her memory. She had no reason to doubt the caller, who spoke with an Indian accent and said his name was Roger. He asked her to turn on her computer and led her through a series of steps so that he could access it remotely. When Langer asked why this was necessary, he said he needed to remove his company’s software from her machine. Because the protection was being terminated, he told her, leaving the software on the computer would cause it to crash. After he gained access to her desktop, using the program TeamViewer, the caller asked Langer to log into her bank to accept the refund, $399, which he was going to transfer into her account. “Because of a technical issue with our system, we won’t be able to refund your money on your credit card or mail you a check,” he said. Langer made a couple of unsuccessful attempts to log in. She didn’t do online banking too often and couldn’t remember her user name. Frustrated, the caller opened her bank’s internet banking registration form on her computer screen, created a new user name and password for her and asked her to fill out the required details — including her address, Social Security number and birth date. When she typed this last part in, the caller noticed she had turned 80 just weeks earlier and wished her a belated happy birthday. “Thank you!” she replied. After submitting the form, he tried to log into Langer’s account but failed, because Langer’s bank — like most banks — activates a newly created user ID only after verifying it by speaking to the customer who has requested it. The caller asked Langer if she could go to her bank to resolve the issue. “How far is the bank from your house?” he asked. A few blocks away, Langer answered. Because it was late afternoon, however, she wasn’t sure if it would be open when she got there. The caller noted that the bank didn’t close until 4:30, which meant she still had 45 minutes. “He was very insistent,” Langer told me recently. On her computer screen, the caller typed out what he wanted her to say at the bank. “Don’t tell them anything about the refund,” he said. She was to say that she needed to log in to check her statements and pay bills. Langer couldn’t recall, when we spoke, if she drove to the bank or not. But later that afternoon, she rang the number the caller had given her and told him she had been unable to get to the bank in time. He advised her to go back the next morning. By now, Langer was beginning to have doubts about the caller. She told him she wouldn’t answer the phone if he contacted her again. “Do you care about your computer?” he asked. He then uploaded a program onto her computer called Lock My PC and locked its screen with a password she couldn’t see. When she complained, he got belligerent. “You can call the police, the F.B.I., the C.I.A.,” he told her. “If you want to use your computer as you were doing, you need to go ahead as I was telling you or else you will lose your computer and your money.” When he finally hung up, after reiterating that he would call the following day, Langer felt shaken. Minutes later, her phone rang again. This caller introduced himself as Jim Browning. “The guy who is trying to convince you to sign into your online banking is after one thing alone, and that is he wants to steal your money,” he said. Langer was mystified that this new caller, who had what seemed to be a strong Irish accent, knew about the conversations she had just had. “Are you sure you are not with this group?” she asked. He replied that the same scammers had targeted him, too. But when they were trying to connect remotely to his computer, as they had done with hers, he had managed to secure access to theirs. For weeks, that remote connection had allowed him to eavesdrop on and record calls like those with Langer, in addition to capturing a visual record of the activity on a scammer’s computer screen. “I’m going to give you the password to unlock your PC because they use the same password every time,” he said. “If you type 4-5-2-1, you’ll unlock it.” Langer keyed in the digits. “OK! It came back on!” she said, relieved. For most people, calls like the one Langer received are a source of annoyance or anxiety. According to the F.B.I.’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, the total losses reported to it by scam victims increased to $3.5 billion in 2019 from $1.4 billion in 2017. Last year, the app Truecaller commissioned the Harris Poll to survey roughly 2,000 American adults and found that 22 percent of the respondents said they had lost money to a phone scam in the past 12 months; Truecaller projects that as many as 56 million Americans may have been victimized this way, losing nearly $20 billion. The person who rescued Langer that afternoon delights in getting these calls, however. “I’m fascinated by scams,” he told me. “I like to know how they work.” A software engineer based in the United Kingdom, he runs a YouTube channel under the pseudonym Jim Browning, where he regularly posts videos about his fraud-fighting efforts, identifying call centers and those involved in the crimes. He began talking to me over Skype in the fall of 2019 — and then sharing recordings like the episode with Langer — on the condition that I not reveal his identity, which he said was necessary to protect himself against the ire of the bad guys and to continue what he characterizes as his activism. Maintaining anonymity, it turns out, is key to scam-busting and scamming alike. I’ll refer to him by his middle initial, L. The goal of L.’s efforts and those of others like him is to raise the costs and risks for perpetrators, who hide behind the veil of anonymity afforded by the internet and typically do not face punishment. The work is a hobby for L. — he has a job at an I.T. company — although it seems more like an obsession. Tracking scammers has consumed much of L.’s free time in the evenings over the past few years, he says, except for several weeks in March and April last year, when the start of the coronavirus pandemic forced strict lockdowns in many parts of the world, causing call centers from which much of this activity emanates to temporarily suspend operations. Ten months later, scamming has “gone right back to the way it was before the pandemic,” L. told me earlier this month. Like L., I was curious to learn more about phone scammers, having received dozens of their calls over the years. They have offered me low interest rates on my credit-card balances, promised to write off my federal student loans and congratulated me on having just won a big lottery. I’ve answered fraudsters claiming to be from the Internal Revenue Service who threaten to send the police to my doorstep unless I agree to pay back taxes that I didn’t know I owed — preferably in the form of iTunes gift cards or by way of a Western Union money transfer. Barring a few exceptions, the individuals calling me have had South Asian accents, leading me to suspect that they are calling from India. On several occasions, I’ve tested this theory by letting the voice on the other end go on for a few minutes before I suddenly interrupt with a torrent of Hindi curses that I retain full mastery of even after living in the United States for the past two decades. I haven’t yet failed to elicit a retaliatory offensive in Hindi. Confirming that these scammers are operating from India hasn’t given me any joy. Instead, as an Indian expatriate living in the United States, I’ve felt a certain shame. L. started going after scammers when a relative of his lost money to a tech-support swindle, a common scheme with many variants. Often, it starts when the mark gets a call from someone offering unsolicited help in ridding a computer’s hard drive of malware or the like. Other times, computer users looking for help stumble upon a website masquerading as Microsoft or Dell or some other computer maker and end up dialing a listed number that connects them to a fraudulent call center. In other instances, victims are tricked by a pop-up warning that their computer is at risk and that they need to call the number flashing on the screen. Once someone is on the phone, the scammers talk the caller into opening up TeamViewer or another remote-access application on his or her computer, after which they get the victim to read back unique identifying information that allows them to establish control over the computer. L. flips the script. He starts by playing an unsuspecting target. Speaking in a polite and even tone, with a cadence that conveys naïveté, he follows instructions and allows the scammer to connect to his device. This doesn’t have any of his actual data, however. It is a “virtual machine,” or a program that simulates a functioning desktop on his computer, including false files, like documents with a fake home address. It looks like a real computer that belongs to someone. “I’ve got a whole lot of identities set up,” L. told me. He uses dummy credit-card numbers that can pass a cursory validation check. The scammer’s connection to L.’s virtual machine is effectively a two-way street that allows L. to connect to the scammer’s computer and infect it with his own software. Once he has done this, he can monitor the scammer’s activities long after the call has ended; sometimes for months, or as long as the software goes undetected. Thus, sitting in his home office, L. is able to listen in on calls between scammer and targets — because these calls are made over the internet, from the scammer’s computer — and watch as the scammer takes control of a victim’s computer. L. acknowledged to me that his access to the scammer’s computer puts him at legal risk; without the scammer’s permission, establishing that access is unlawful. But that doesn’t worry him. “If it came down to someone wanting to prosecute me for accessing a scammer’s computer illegally, I can demonstrate in every single case that the only reason I gained access is because the scammer was trying to steal money from me,” he says. On occasion, L. succeeds in turning on the scammer’s webcam and is able to record video of the scammer and others at the call center, who can usually be heard on phones in the background. From the I.P. address of the scammer’s computer and other clues, L. frequently manages to identify the neighborhood — and, in some cases, the actual building — where the call center is. When he encounters a scam in progress while monitoring a scammer’s computer, L. tries to both document and disrupt it, at times using his real-time access to undo the scammer’s manipulations of the victim’s computer. He tries to contact victims to warn them before they lose any money — as he did in the case of Kathleen Langer. L.’s videos of such episodes have garnered millions of views, making him a faceless YouTube star. He says he hopes his exploits will educate the public and deter scammers. He claims he has emailed the law-enforcement authorities in India offering to share the evidence he has collected against specific call centers. Except for one instance, his inquiries have elicited only form responses, although last year, the police raided a call center that L. had identified in Gurugram, outside Delhi, after it was featured in an investigation aired by the BBC. Now and then during our Skype conversations, L. would begin monitoring a call between a scammer and a mark and let me listen in. In some instances, I would also hear other call-center employees in the background — some of them making similar calls, others talking among themselves. The chatter evoked a busy workplace, reminding me of my late nights in a Kolkata newsroom, where I began my journalism career 25 years ago, except that these were young men and women working through the night to con people many time zones away. When scammers called me in the past, I tried cajoling them into telling me about their enterprise but never succeeded. Now, with L.’s help, I thought, I might have better luck. I flew to India at the end of 2019 hoping to visit some of the call centers that L. had identified as homes for scams. Although he had detected many tech-support scams originating from Delhi, Hyderabad and other Indian cities, L. was convinced that Kolkata — based on the volume of activity he was noticing there — had emerged as a capital of such frauds. I knew the city well, having covered the crime beat there for an English-language daily in the mid-1990s, and so I figured that my chances of tracking down scammers would be better there than most other places in India. I took with me, in my notebook, a couple of addresses that L. identified in the days just before my trip as possible origins for some scam calls. Because the geolocation of I.P. addresses — ascertaining the geographical coordinates associated with an internet connection — isn’t an exact science, I wasn’t certain that they would yield any scammers. But I did have the identity of a person linked to one of these spots, a young man whose first name is Shahbaz. L. identified him by matching webcam images and several government-issued IDs found on his computer. The home address on his ID matched what L. determined, from the I.P. address, to be the site of the call center where he operated, which suggested that the call center was located where he lived or close by. That made me optimistic I would find him there. In a recording of a call Shahbaz made in November, weeks before my Kolkata visit, I heard him trying to hustle a woman in Ottawa and successfully intimidating and then fleecing an elderly man in the United States. Image Murlidhar Sharma, a senior police official, whose team raided two call centers in Kolkata in October 2019 based on a complaint from Microsoft.Credit...Prarthna Singh for The New York Times Although individuals like this particular scammer are the ones responsible for manipulating victims on the phone, they represent only the outward face of a multibillion-dollar criminal industry. “Call centers that run scams employ all sorts of subcontractors,” Puneet Singh, an F.B.I. agent who serves as the bureau’s legal attaché at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, told me. These include sellers of phone numbers; programmers who develop malware and pop-ups; and money mules. From the constantly evolving nature of scams — lately I’ve been receiving calls from the “law-enforcement department of the Federal Reserve System” about an outstanding arrest warrant instead of the fake Social Security Administration calls I was getting a year ago — it’s evident that the industry has its share of innovators. The reasons this activity seems to have flourished in India are much the same as those behind the growth of the country’s legitimate information-technology-services industry after the early 2000s, when many American companies like Microsoft and Dell began outsourcing customer support to workers in India. The industry expanded rapidly as more companies in developed countries saw the same economic advantage in relocating various services there that could be performed remotely — from airline ticketing to banking. India’s large population of English speakers kept labor costs down. Because the overwhelming majority of call centers in the country are engaged in legitimate business, the ones that aren’t can hide in plain sight. Amid the mazes of gleaming steel-and-glass high-rises in a place like Cyber City, near Delhi, or Sector V in Salt Lake, near Kolkata — two of the numerous commercial districts that have sprung up across the country to nurture I.T. businesses — it’s impossible to distinguish a call center that handles inquiries from air travelers in the United States from one that targets hundreds of Americans every day with fraudulent offers to lower their credit-card interest rates. The police do periodically crack down on operations that appear to be illegitimate. Shortly after I got to Kolkata, the police raided five call centers in Salt Lake that officials said had been running a tech-support scam. The employees of the call centers were accused of impersonating Microsoft representatives. The police raid followed a complaint by the tech company, which in recent years has increasingly pressed Indian law enforcement to act against scammers abusing the company’s name. I learned from Murlidhar Sharma, a senior official in the city police, that his team had raided two other call centers in Kolkata a couple of months earlier in response to a similar complaint. “Microsoft had done extensive work before coming to us,” Sharma, who is in his 40s and speaks with quiet authority, told me. The company lent its help to the police in connection with the raids, which Sharma seemed particularly grateful for. Often the police lack the resources to pursue these sorts of cases. “These people are very smart, and they know how to hide data,” Sharma said, referring to the scammers. It was in large part because of Microsoft’s help, he said, that investigators had been able to file charges in court within a month after the raid. A trial has begun but could drag on for years. The call centers have been shut down, at least for now. Sharma pointed out that pre-emptive raids do not yield the desired results. “Our problem,” he said, “is that we can act only when there’s a complaint of cheating.” In 2017, he and his colleagues raided a call center on their own initiative, without a complaint, and arrested several people. “But then the court was like, ‘Why did the police raid these places?’” Sharma said. The judge wanted statements from victims, which the police were unable to get, despite contacting authorities in the U.S. and U.K. The case fell apart. The slim chances of detection, and the even slimmer chances of facing prosecution, have seemed to make scamming a career option, especially among those who lack the qualifications to find legitimate employment in India’s slowing economy. Indian educational institutions churn out more than 1.5 million engineers every year, but according to one survey fewer than 20 percent are equipped to land positions related to their training, leaving a vast pool of college graduates — not to mention an even larger population of less-educated young men and women — struggling to earn a living. That would partly explain why call centers run by small groups are popping up in residential neighborhoods. “The worst thing about this crime is that it’s becoming trendy,” Aparajita Rai, a deputy commissioner in the Kolkata Police, told me. “More and more youngsters are investing the crucial years of their adolescence into this. Everybody wants fast money.” In Kolkata, I met Aniruddha Nath, then 23, who said he spent a week working at a call center that he quickly realized was engaged in fraud. Nath has a pensive air and a shy smile that intermittently cut through his solemnness as he spoke. While finishing his undergraduate degree in engineering from a local college — he took a loan to study there — Nath got a job offer after a campus interview. The company insisted he join immediately, for a monthly salary of about $200. Nath asked me not to name the company out of fear that he would be exposing himself legally. His jubilation turned into skepticism on his very first day, when he and other fresh recruits were told to simply memorize the contents of the company’s website, which claimed his employer was based in Australia. On a whim, he Googled the address of the Australian office listed on the site and discovered that only a parking garage was located there. He said he learned a couple of days later what he was to do: Call Indian students in Australia whose visas were about to expire and offer to place them in a job in Australia if they paid $800 to take a training course. Image The Garden Reach area in Kolkata.Credit...Prarthna Singh for The New York Times On his seventh day at work, Nath said, he received evidence from a student in Australia that the company’s promise to help with job placements was simply a ruse to steal $800; the training the company offered was apparently little more than a farce. “She sent me screenshots of complaints from individuals who had been defrauded,” Nath said. He stopped going in to work the next day. His parents were unhappy, and, he said, told him: “What does it matter to you what the company is doing? You’ll be getting your salary.” Nath answered, “If there’s a raid there, I’ll be charged with fraud.” Late in the afternoon the day after I met with Nath, I drove to Garden Reach, a predominantly Muslim and largely poor section in southwest Kolkata on the banks of the Hooghly River. Home to a 137-year-old shipyard, the area includes some of the city’s noted crime hot spots and has a reputation for crime and violence. Based on my experience reporting from Garden Reach in the 1990s, I thought it was probably not wise to venture there alone late at night, even though that was most likely the best time to find scammers at work. I was looking for Shahbaz. Parking my car in the vicinity of the address L. had given me, I walked through a narrow lane where children were playing cricket, past a pharmacy and a tiny store selling cookies and snacks. The apartment I sought was on the second floor of a building at the end of an alley, a few hundred yards from a mosque. It was locked, but a woman next door said that the building belonged to Shahbaz’s extended family and that he lived in one of the apartments with his parents. Then I saw an elderly couple seated on the steps in the front — his parents, it turned out. The father summoned Shahbaz’s brother, a lanky, longhaired man who appeared to be in his 20s. He said Shahbaz had woken up a short while earlier and gone out on his motorbike. “I don’t know when he goes to sleep and when he wakes up,” his father said, with what sounded like exasperation. They gave me Shahbaz’s mobile number, but when I called, I got no answer. It was getting awkward for me to wait around indefinitely without disclosing why I was there, so eventually I pulled the brother aside to talk in private. We sat down on a bench at a roadside tea stall, a quarter mile from the mosque. Between sips of tea, I told him that I was a journalist in the United States and wanted to meet his brother because I had learned he was a scammer. I hoped he would pass on my message. I got a call from Shahbaz a few hours later. He denied that he’d ever worked at a call center. “There are a lot of young guys who are involved in the scamming business, but I’m not one of them,” he said. I persisted, but he kept brushing me off until I asked him to confirm that his birthday was a few days later in December. “Look, you are telling me my exact birth date — that makes me nervous,” he said. He wanted to know what I knew about him and how I knew it. I said I would tell him if he met with me. I volunteered to protect his identity if he answered my questions truthfully. Two days later, we met for lunch at the Taj Bengal, one of Kolkata’s five-star hotels. I’d chosen that as the venue out of concern for my safety. When he showed up in the hotel lobby, however, I felt a little silly. Physically, Shahbaz is hardly intimidating. He is short and skinny, with a face that would seem babyish but for his thin mustache and beard, which are still a work in progress. He was in his late 20s but had brought along an older cousin for his own safety. We found a secluded table in the hotel’s Chinese restaurant and sat down. I took out my phone and played a video that L. had posted on YouTube. (Only those that L. shared the link with knew of its existence.) The video was a recording of the call from November 2019 in which Shahbaz was trying to defraud the woman in Ottawa with a trick that scammers often use to arm-twist their victims: editing the HTML coding of the victim’s bank-account webpage to alter the balances. Because the woman was pushing back, Shahbaz zeroed out her balance to make it look as if he had the ability to drain her account. On the call, he can be heard threatening her: “You don’t want to lose all your money, right?” I watched him shift uncomfortably in his chair. “Whose voice is that?” I asked. “It’s yours, isn’t it?” Image Aniruddha Nath spent a week on the job at a call center when he realized that it was engaged in fraud. A lack of other opportunities can make such call centers an appealing enterprise.Credit...Prarthna Singh for The New York Times He nodded in shocked silence. I took my phone back and suggested he drink some water. He took a few sips, gathering himself before I began questioning him. When he mumbled in response to my first couple of questions, I jokingly asked him to summon the bold, confident voice we’d just heard in the recording of his call. He gave me a wan smile. Pointing to my voice recorder on the table, he asked, meekly, “Is this necessary?” When his scam calls were already on YouTube, I countered, how did it matter that I was recording our conversation? “It just makes me nervous,” he said. Shahbaz told me his parents sent him to one of the city’s better schools but that he flunked out in eighth grade and had to move to a neighborhood school. When his father lost his job, Shahbaz found work riding around town on his bicycle to deliver medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies from a wholesaler to retail pharmacies; he earned $25 a month. Sometime around 2011 or 2012, he told me, a friend took him to a call center in Salt Lake, where he got his first job in scamming, though he didn’t realize right away that that was what he was doing. At first, he said, the job seemed like legitimate telemarketing for tech-support services. By 2015, working in his third job, at a call center in the heart of Kolkata, Shahbaz had learned how to coax victims into filling out a Western Union transfer in order to process a refund for terminated tech-support services. “They would expect a refund but instead get charged,” he told me. Shahbaz earned a modest salary in these first few jobs — he told me that that first call center, in Salt Lake, paid him less than $100 a month. His lengthy commute every night was exhausting. In 2016 or 2017, he began working with a group of scammers in Garden Reach, earning a share of the profits. There were at least five others who worked with him, he said. All of them were local residents, some more experienced than others. One associate at the call center was his wife’s brother. He was cagey about naming the others or describing the organization’s structure, but it was evident that he wasn’t in charge. He told me that a supervisor had taught him how to intimidate victims by editing their bank balances. “We started doing that about a year ago,” he said, adding that their group was somewhat behind the curve when it came to adopting the latest tricks of the trade. When those on the cutting edge of the business develop something new, he said, the idea gradually spreads to other scammers. It was hard to ascertain how much this group was stealing from victims every day, but Shahbaz confessed that he was able to defraud one or two people every night, extracting anywhere from $200 to $300 per victim. He was paid about a quarter of the stolen amount. He told me that he and his associates would ask victims to drive to a store and buy gift cards, while staying on the phone for the entire duration. Sometimes, he said, all that effort was ruined if suspicious store clerks declined to sell gift cards to the victim. “It’s becoming tough these days, because customers aren’t as gullible as they used to be,” he told me. I could see from his point of view why scammers, like practitioners in any field, felt pressure to come up with new methods and scams in response to increasing public awareness of their schemes. The more we spoke, the more I recognized that Shahbaz was a small figure in this gigantic criminal ecosystem that constitutes the phone-scam industry, the equivalent of a pickpocket on a Kolkata bus who is unlucky enough to get caught in the act. He had never thought of running his own call center, he told me, because that required knowing people who could provide leads — names and numbers of targets to call — as well as others who could help move stolen money through illicit channels. “I don’t have such contacts,” he said. There were many in Kolkata, according to Shahbaz, who ran operations significantly bigger than the one he was a part of. “I know of people who had nothing earlier but are now very rich,” he said. Shahbaz implied that his own ill-gotten earnings were paltry in comparison. He hadn’t bought a car or a house, but he admitted that he had been able to afford to go on overseas vacations with friends. On Facebook, I saw a photo of him posing in front of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and other pictures from a visit to Thailand. I asked if he ever felt guilty. He didn’t answer directly but said there had been times when he had let victims go after learning that they were struggling to pay bills or needed the money for medical expenses. But for most victims, his rationale seemed to be that they could afford to part with the few hundred dollars he was stealing. Shahbaz was a reluctant interviewee, giving me brief, guarded answers that were less than candid or directly contradicted evidence that L. had collected. He was vague about the highest amount he’d ever stolen from a victim, at one point saying $800, then later admitting to $1,500. I found it hard to trust either figure, because on one of his November calls I heard him bullying someone to pay him $5,000. He told me that my visit to his house had left him shaken, causing him to realize how wrong he was to be defrauding people. His parents and his wife were worried about him. And so, he had quit scamming, he told me. “What did you do last night?” I asked him. “I went to sleep,” he said. I knew he was not telling the truth about his claim to have stopped scamming, however. Two days earlier, hours after our phone conversation following my visit to Garden Reach, Shahbaz had been at it again. It was on that night, in fact, that he tried to swindle Kathleen Langer in Crossville, Tenn. Before I came to see him for lunch, I had already heard a recording of that call, which L. shared with me. When I mentioned that to him, he looked at me pleadingly, in visible agony, as if I’d poked at a wound. It was clear to me that he was only going to admit to wrongdoing that I already had evidence of. L. told me that the remote access he had to Shahbaz’s computer went cold after I met with him on Dec. 14, 2019. But it buzzed back to life about 10 weeks later. The I.P. address was the same as before, which suggested that it was operating in the same location I visited. L. set up a livestream on YouTube so I could see what L. was observing. The microphone was on, and L. and I could clearly hear people making scam calls in the background. The computer itself didn’t seem to be engaged in anything nefarious while we were eavesdropping on it, but L. could see that Shahbaz’s phone was connected to it. It appeared that Shahbaz had turned the computer on to download music. I couldn’t say for certain, but it seemed that he was taking a moment to chill in the middle of another long night at work.

Scientists initially estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the population needed to acquire resistance to the coronavirus to banish it. Now Dr. Anthony Fauci and others are quietly shifting that number upward. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci in March. “We really don’t know what the real number is,” he said recently.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times By Donald G. McNeil Jr. Dec. 24, 2020 Leer en español At what point does a country achieve herd immunity? What portion of the population must acquire resistance to the coronavirus, either through infection or vaccination, in order for the disease to fade away and life to return to normal? Since the start of the pandemic, the figure that many epidemiologists have offered has been 60 to 70 percent. That range is still cited by the World Health Organization and is often repeated during discussions of the future course of the disease. Although it is impossible to know with certainty what the limit will be until we reach it and transmission stops, having a good estimate is important: It gives Americans a sense of when we can hope to breathe freely again. Recently, a figure to whom millions of Americans look for guidance — Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an adviser to both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration — has begun incrementally raising his herd-immunity estimate. In the pandemic’s early days, Dr. Fauci tended to cite the same 60 to 70 percent estimate that most experts did. About a month ago, he began saying “70, 75 percent” in television interviews. And last week, in an interview with CNBC News, he said “75, 80, 85 percent” and “75 to 80-plus percent.” In a telephone interview the next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks. Hard as it may be to hear, he said, he believes that it may take close to 90 percent immunity to bring the virus to a halt — almost as much as is needed to stop a measles outbreak. Asked about Dr. Fauci’s conclusions, prominent epidemiologists said that he might be proven right. The early range of 60 to 70 percent was almost undoubtedly too low, they said, and the virus is becoming more transmissible, so it will take greater herd immunity to stop it. Dr. Fauci said that weeks ago, he had hesitated to publicly raise his estimate because many Americans seemed hesitant about vaccines, which they would need to accept almost universally in order for the country to achieve herd immunity. Now that some polls are showing that many more Americans are ready, even eager, for vaccines, he said he felt he could deliver the tough message that the return to normal might take longer than anticipated. “When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said. “Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.” “We need to have some humility here,” he added. “We really don’t know what the real number is. I think the real range is somewhere between 70 to 90 percent. But, I’m not going to say 90 percent.” Doing so might be discouraging to Americans, he said, because he is not sure there will be enough voluntary acceptance of vaccines to reach that goal. Although sentiments about vaccines in polls have bounced up and down this year, several current ones suggest that about 20 percent of Americans say they are unwilling to accept any vaccine. Also, Dr. Fauci noted, a herd-immunity figure at 90 percent or above is in the range of the infectiousness of measles. “I’d bet my house that Covid isn’t as contagious as measles,” he said. Measles is thought to be the world’s most contagious disease; it can linger in the air for hours or drift through vents to infect people in other rooms. In some studies of outbreaks in crowded military barracks and student dormitories, it has kept transmitting until more than 95 percent of all residents are infected. Interviews with epidemiologists regarding the degree of herd immunity needed to defeat the coronavirus produced a range of estimates, some of which were in line with Dr. Fauci’s. They also came with a warning: All answers are merely “guesstimates.” “You tell me what numbers to put in my equations, and I’ll give you the answer,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “But you can’t tell me the numbers, because nobody knows them.” The Coronavirus Outbreak › Latest Updates Updated Feb. 12, 2021, 2:59 p.m. ET The W.H.O. ties a sharp rise in Covid deaths across Africa to overwhelmed health systems. The C.D.C. urges reopening schools and sets out new guidelines for doing so. The F.D.A. agrees Moderna can increase the amount of vaccine in each vial. The only truly accurate measures of herd immunity are done in actual herds and come from studying animal viruses like rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, said Dr. David M. Morens, Dr. Fauci’s senior adviser on epidemiology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. When cattle are penned in corrals, it is easy to measure how fast a disease spreads from one animal to another, he said. Humans move around, so studying disease spread among them is far harder. The original assumption that it would take 60 to 70 percent immunity to stop the disease was based on early data from China and Italy, health experts noted. Epidemiologists watching how fast cases doubled in those outbreaks calculated that the virus’s reproduction number, or R0 — how many new victims each carrier infected — was about 3. So two out of three potential victims would have to become immune before each carrier infected fewer than one. When each carrier infects fewer than one new victim, the outbreak slowly dies out. Two out of three is 66.7 percent, which established the range of 60 to 70 percent for herd immunity. Image The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle arriving in the port of Toulon in April, carrying infected sailors.Credit... Marine Nationale, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Reinforcing that notion was a study conducted by the French military on the crew of the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, which had an outbreak in late March, said Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The study found that 1,064 of the 1,568 sailors aboard, or about 68 percent, had tested positive for the virus. Covid-19 Vaccines › What You Need to Know About the Vaccine Rollout Providers in the U.S. are administering about 1.3 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines per day, on average. Almost 30 million people have received at least one dose, and about 7 million have been fully vaccinated. How many people have been vaccinated in your state? The U.S. is far behind several other countries in getting its population vaccinated. In the near future, travel may require digital documentation showing that passengers have been vaccinated or tested for the coronavirus. When can you get the vaccine? What are the vaccine’s side effects? Is it safe to take during pregnancy? We’ve have answers to many of your questions. But the carrier returned to port while the outbreak was still in progress, and the crew went into quarantine, so it was unclear whether the virus was finished infecting new sailors even after 68 percent had caught it. Also, outbreaks aboard ships are poor models for those on land because infections move much faster in the close quarters of a vessel than in a free-roaming civilian population, said Dr. Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida. More important, the early estimates from Wuhan and Italy were later revised upward, Dr. Lipsitch noted, once Chinese scientists realized they had undercounted the number of victims of the first wave. It took about two months to be certain that there were many asymptomatic people who had also spread the virus. It also became clearer later that “superspreader events,” in which one person infects dozens or even hundreds of others, played a large role in spreading Covid-19. Such events, in “normal” populations — in which no one wears masks and everyone attends events like parties, basketball tournaments or Broadway shows — can push the reproduction number upward to 4, 5 or even 6, experts said. Consequently, those scenarios call for higher herd immunity; for example, at an R0 of 5, more than four out of five people, or 80 percent, must be immune to slow down the virus. Further complicating matters, there is a growing consensus among scientists that the virus itself is becoming more transmissible. A variant “Italian strain” with the mutation known as D614G has spread much faster than the original Wuhan variant. A newly identified mutation, sometimes called N501Y, that may make the virus even more infectious has recently appeared in Britain, South Africa and elsewhere. The more transmissible a pathogen, the more people must become immune in order to stop it. Dr. Morens and Dr. Lipsitch agreed with Dr. Fauci that the level of herd immunity needed to stop Covid-19 could be 85 percent or higher. “But that’s a guesstimate,” Dr. Lipsitch emphasized. “Tony’s reading the tea leaves,” Dr. Morens said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers no herd immunity estimate, saying on its website that “experts do not know.” Although W.H.O. scientists still sometimes cite the older 60 to 70 percent estimate, Dr. Katherine O’Brien, the agency’s director of immunization, said that she now thought that range was too low. She declined to estimate what the correct higher one might be. “We’d be leaning against very thin reeds if we tried to say what level of vaccine coverage would be needed to achieve it,” she said. “We should say we just don’t know. And it won’t be a world or even national number. It will depend on what community you live in.” Dr. Dean noted that to stop transmission in a crowded city like New York, more people would have to achieve immunity than would be necessary in a less crowded place like Montana. Even if Dr. Fauci is right and it will take 85 or even 90 percent herd immunity to completely stop coronavirus transmission, Dr. Lipsitch said, “we can still defang the virus sooner than that.” He added: “We don’t have to have zero transmission in order to have a decent society. We have lots of diseases, like flu, transmitting all the time, and we don’t shut down society for that. If we can vaccinate almost all the people who are most at risk of severe outcomes, then this would become a milder disease.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Games Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition International Canada Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2021 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Accessibility Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions"

Randy Haas, an archaeologist at the University of California, Davis, and a group of colleagues, concluded in a paper published in the journal Science Advances on Wednesday that this young woman was a big game hunter, who participated with her people in the pursuit of the vicuña and deer that made up a significant portion of their diet. The find of a female hunter is unusual. But Dr. Haas and his colleagues make a larger claim about the division of labor at this time period in the Americas. They argue that additional research shows something close to equal participation in hunting for both sexes. In general, they conclude, “early females in the Americas were big game hunters.” Other scientists found the claim that the remains were those of a female hunter convincing, but some said the data didn’t support the broader claim. Robert L. Kelly, an anthropologist at the University of Wyoming who has written extensively on hunter gatherers, said that while one female skeleton may well have been a hunter, he was not persuaded by the analysis of other burials that “the prevalence of male-female hunters was near parity.” The researchers’ sample of graves was small, he said, noting that none of the other burials were clearly female hunters. Bonnie L. Pitblado, an anthropologist at the University of Oklahoma whose specialty is the peopling of the Americas, said the findings were “well-reasoned and an important idea for future testing.” The authors could question gender roles further and what determined them, she said, calling the study “a really refreshing contribution” to studies of early settlers of the Americas. Image Vicuña in the Andes Mountains.Credit...Randall Haas In most contemporary and recent societies of hunter gatherers, Dr. Haas said, it is well-established that hunting is predominantly done by males. Archaeological evidence has tended to support the conclusion that past gender roles were similar. On occasion, female remains have been associated with materials that suggested that they were hunters but the examples have been treated as outliers. What if they weren’t, Dr. Haas suggested, and the overall view of hunting should be adjusted? He and others found the grave of the young female with the hunting materials at a site called Wilamaya Patjxa in the Puno district of southern Peru at an altitude of almost 13,000 feet. A. Pilco Quispe, a local collaborator, first found artifacts in that area in 2013 near the community of Mulla Fasiri. In 2018, working with community members, Dr. Haas and others excavated an area of about 400 square feet, recovering about 20,000 artifacts. They found five burial sites with remains of six people, one of whom was the hunter. ECUADOR Amazon River PERU BRAZIL Lima Lake Titicaca Pacific Ocean Wilamaya Patjxa Puno 200 miles By The New York Times That find was particularly exciting. One of his collaborators kept finding projectile points, Dr. Haas said, and then a collection of points and other stone tools, with the remains of a skeleton. The group of excavators was thrilled, he said, and the substance of the conversation was, “Oh, he must have been a great chief. He was a great hunter.” As it turned out, the buried person, who now goes by the scientific identifier WMP6, was female, about 17-19 years old. Her bones were lighter than might have been expected for a male, and a study of proteins in dental enamel, a relatively new technique for sex identification, showed she was definitely female. Dr. Haas then looked at 429 burials in the Americas from about 14,000 to 8,000 years ago and identified 27 individuals whose sex had been determined who were found with big game hunting implements. Eleven were female and 16 were male. He and his authors acknowledged that the data was not conclusive for these burials, and that the only individual that was undeniably female and a hunter was the person from Wilamaya Patjxa. But, Dr. Haas said, the preponderance of the evidence still led to the conclusion that females were about 30 to 50 percent of the big game hunters. That conclusion is what Dr. Kelly found unsubstantiated. Two of the burials were of infants, which Dr. Haas and his collaborators described as buried with artifacts that suggested they would be hunters. And he cautioned about reading too much into burials. “The interpretation of grave goods, as a cultural, symbolic act, is not simple or straightforward.” He had criticisms of the interpretation of the other skeletons as well, and said, “If we accept WMP6 as the only female hunter in the sample, then it suggests the most likely prevalence of female hunters is 10 percent. I would not be surprised at that.” AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account NYTLicensing news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account NYTLicensing Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Games Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition International Canada Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2021 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Accessibility Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions"

SAN FRANCISCO — This past week, a trading card featuring the quarterback Tom Brady sold for a record $1.3 million. The total value of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin hit $1 trillion. And Christie’s sold a digital artwork by an artist known as Beeple for $69.3 million after bids started at just $100. These seemingly singular events were all connected, part of a series of manias that have gripped the financial world. For months, professional and everyday investors have pushed up the prices of stocks and real estate. Now the frenzy has spilled over into the riskiest — and in some cases, wackiest — assets, including digital ephemera and media, cryptocurrencies, collectibles like trading cards and even sneakers. The surges have been driven by a unique set of conditions. Even as millions were laid off in the pandemic, many people’s bank accounts flourished, flush from stimulus checks and government cash infusions into the economy. But while people accumulated more money, traditional investments like stocks and bonds became less attractive. So many got creative and, bored in the pandemic, took on more risk. Often, they were egged on by online communities on Reddit and Discord, where the next big investments were hotly debated. They also turned to tech tools like the trading app Robinhood and the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, which allowed them to buy and trade different items with the click of a button. That has now led to mini-bubbles across a wide variety of esoteric categories, making once-obscure acronyms like SPACs and NFTs practically as ubiquitous as the S&P. It has also fed ferocious demand for this week’s public listings of companies like the gaming site Roblox and the South Korean e-commerce company Coupang, as well as for shares of the video game retailer GameStop and other so-called “meme” stocks. “It’s just a pent-up cycle where the money has nowhere to go, so it’s doing stupid things,” said Howard Lindzon, an investor, entrepreneur and market commentator. Image A Tom Brady rookie card sold for a record $1.3 million this past week.Credit...PWCC Marketplace The manias, which have erupted at a time of deep economic pain, have introduced a large amount of risk to many investors. Some people have already racked up staggering losses on Robinhood, which has been accused of encouraging gambling-like behavior. Other assets, like Bitcoin, are volatile, while sneakers and NFTs are so new and hyped-up that it is difficult to know what they will be worth over time. For now, the bubble-upon-bubble behavior does not appear to pose a systemic risk to the broader financial system. But some investors said they were uneasy. “Most people are cheering, but at the same time, shaking their heads and going, when is the bust coming?” said Jane Leung, the chief investment officer at SVB Private Bank. One of those who bought into the frenzy was Matthew Schorr, 35, a lawyer in Cherry Hill, N.J. For years, he has been on the lookout for hot investments, but lost interest in the stock market and abandoned Bitcoin after his friends dismissed the cryptocurrency as “fake money.” He now regrets that because the value of a single Bitcoin has soared above $57,000, meaning the eight Bitcoin he paid for a Domino’s pizza in 2011 would be worth more than $450,000 today. Mr. Schorr did not want to miss out again. So starting in January, he spent $5,000 to buy 351 videos from NBA Top Shot, a site for trading basketball highlight clips, after he saw social media chatter about them selling for tens of thousands of dollars. The value of those clips has now soared to $67,000, according to Momentranks.com, which tracks the sales. The clips are a type of investment known as NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, which have taken off in music, art and sports. The digital tokens use networks of computers to prove that a digital item like a video, image or song is authentic, giving the item a value — at least in the eyes of the person buying it. Some liken NFTs to digital trading cards. (The creators of the underlying works typically retain the copyright.) Skeptics consider NFTs among the most questionable of assets, since an NFT image can be endlessly copied and shared. Still, enough people are convinced of the value of authenticating tokens that they have dovetailed with another market-propelling phenomenon, FOMO, or “fear of missing out.” “I’m trying to keep my finger on the pulse and not let myself fall behind again,” said Mr. Schorr, who spends as much as five hours a day researching the market and chatting with fellow collectors on Discord. “That sort of return over six weeks is completely unheard-of in any financial vehicle.” Last month, NBA Top Shot crossed $232 million in total sales since it started last year — including $47.5 million in sales on a single day. “I think there is another 100X from here,” said Roham Gharegozlou, chief executive of Dapper Labs, the company that partnered with the NBA to create NBA Top Shot. “There is so much demand.” Image Electronic musician 3lau made $11.7 million this month selling NFTs related to one of his previously released albums.Credit...Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images Much of this investment momentum began last year, after the coronavirus spread and the global economy went into free fall. In response, the United States slashed interest rates, bought government bonds and passed stimulus packages. Germany, Brazil, Japan and other countries took similar actions. Those moves had a twofold effect of increasing the amount of money in the global financial system while also encouraging people to spend. Deposits in U.S. bank accounts hit $16.45 trillion last month, more than $3 trillion above the level in January 2020, according to Federal Reserve data. The interest rate set by the Federal Reserve has been near zero since last March. Low interest rates made traditional investments like bonds less attractive, while stocks, which have risen for a decade, became even more expensive. That was when more people started investing in nontraditional assets. With NFTs, the hysteria escalated quickly. Last month, an NFT GIF of Nyan Cat, which shows an animated flying cat with a Pop-Tart body, sold for roughly $580,000. Other artists, including Grimes and Steve Aoki, began reaping millions of dollars from their digital artwork. Then on Thursday, Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, sold his “Everydays — The First 5000 Days” NFT for a stunning $69.3 million. Slava Rubin, founder of Vincent, a start-up that helps people find investments in alternative assets such as wine, collectibles and litigation finance, said his site has attracted tens of thousands of users. Last month, he said, interest in NFTs jumped by 44 percent and collectibles by 33 percent, making them the fastest-growing categories on the site. “The public is really leaning into these new ways of thinking about how to invest, whether it’s for pure profit, a hobby or based on nostalgia and interest,” he said. This month, the electronic musician 3lau made $11.7 million selling NFTs related to one of his previously released albums. Buyers not only received the digital tokens representing the authentic version of the album, but also got access to new music and a limited edition vinyl copy. 3lau, whose real name is Justin Blau, said he was “blown away” by the price and how it showed support for the new market. “People are excited about storing value in a medium that gives them emotional value,” he said. Investors have also gravitated to SPACs, which are “special purpose acquisition companies.” Many have thrown money at these financial vehicles, which trade on the public market, even though they are shell companies with no operations. Instead, their creators promise shareholders that they will find a private company to merge with, effectively taking the company public. SPACs have been so plentiful this year that they outnumber new listings from real companies by nearly four to one, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks public listings. Some investment firms have rolled out three or four new SPACs at a time, while celebrities and sports stars including Shaquille O’Neal, Serena Williams, Colin Kaepernick and Ciara have formed their own. Often, the SPACs merge with companies that have never made a dollar. Two electric air taxi companies that do not expect any revenue for years — Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation — announced SPAC deals last month that valued them at $6.6 billion and $3.8 billion respectively. Image Scott Cutler, chief executive of StockX, a sneaker and collectibles marketplace, said shoe sales in January were nearly double that of a year ago.Credit...Nick Hagen for The New York Times Sneaker reselling has also exploded. On StockX, a marketplace comparable to eBay where people buy and sell sneakers and other collectibles, shoe sales in January were nearly double that of a year ago, said Scott Cutler, the company’s chief executive. That growth was helped by the sale of a famous style of Nike Dunks — the SB Low Staple NYC Pigeon — for a record $33,400 that month. Younger generations want to invest in things that are culturally relevant and financially sound, Mr. Cutler said, and sneakers are “actually a far more stable investment than you may assume.” Trading card sales have taken off, too. The price of mint condition cards on StockX jumped to an average $775 in January from $280 a year ago. This week’s $1.3 million sale of the Tom Brady card — one of 100 of its kind from his rookie season — followed a similar Brady card going for $555,988 in January. Predicting when and how the party will end is anyone’s guess. Some anticipate that wide vaccine distribution and a return to normal life post-pandemic will bring about a Roaring Twenties-style era of prosperity. While that decade ended in a devastating crash, the euphoria lasted years. That period was “pretty wild” and led to “pretty rapid technological change,” said Laura Veldkamp, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. “And there was lots of money to be made.” AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Site Index Go to Home Page » news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel Listings & More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account NYTLicensing news Home Page World Coronavirus U.S. Politics New York Business Tech Science Climate Sports Obituaries The Upshot International Canada Español 中文网 Today's Paper Corrections Opinion Today's Opinion Op-Ed Columnists Editorials Op-Ed Contributors Letters Sunday Review Video: Opinion Arts Today's Arts Art & Design Books Dance Movies Music Pop Culture Television Theater What to Watch Video: Arts Living At Home Automobiles Games Education Food Health Jobs Love Magazine Parenting Real Estate Recipes Style T Magazine Travel More Reader Center Wirecutter Live Events The Learning Network Tools & Services Multimedia Photography Video Newsletters TimesMachine NYT Store Times Journeys Manage My Account NYTLicensing Subscribe Home Delivery Digital Subscriptions Games Cooking Email Newsletters Corporate Subscriptions Education Rate Mobile Applications Replica Edition International Canada Español 中文网 Site Information Navigation © 2021 The New York Times Company NYTCo Contact Us Accessibility Work with us Advertise T Brand Studio Your Ad Choices Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Site Map Canada International Help Subscriptions"

They aren’t. Credit...Justin Poulsen for The New York Times Supported byContinue reading the main story By Kevin Roose March 6, 2021 The robots are coming. Not to kill you with lasers, or beat you in chess, or even to ferry you around town in a driverless Uber. These robots are here to merge purchase orders into columns J and K of next quarter’s revenue forecast, and transfer customer data from the invoicing software to the Oracle database. They are unassuming software programs with names like “Auxiliobits — DataTable To Json String,” and they are becoming the star employees at many American companies. Some of these tools are simple apps, downloaded from online stores and installed by corporate I.T. departments, that do the dull-but-critical tasks that someone named Phil in Accounting used to do: reconciling bank statements, approving expense reports, reviewing tax forms. Others are expensive, custom-built software packages, armed with more sophisticated types of artificial intelligence, that are capable of doing the kinds of cognitive work that once required teams of highly-paid humans. White-collar workers, armed with college degrees and specialized training, once felt relatively safe from automation. But recent advances in A.I. and machine learning have created algorithms capable of outperforming doctors, lawyers and bankers at certain parts of their jobs. And as bots learn to do higher-value tasks, they are climbing the corporate ladder. The trend — quietly building for years, but accelerating to warp speed since the pandemic — goes by the sleepy moniker “robotic process automation.” And it is transforming workplaces at a pace that few outsiders appreciate. Nearly 8 in 10 corporate executives surveyed by Deloitte last year said they had implemented some form of R.P.A. Another 16 percent said they planned to do so within three years. Most of this automation is being done by companies you’ve probably never heard of. UiPath, the largest stand-alone automation firm, is valued at $35 billion — roughly the size of eBay — and is slated to go public later this year. Other companies like Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism, which have Fortune 500 companies like Coca-Cola and Walgreens Boots Alliance as clients, are also enjoying breakneck growth, and tech giants like Microsoft have recently introduced their own automation products to get in on the action. Executives generally spin these bots as being good for everyone, “streamlining operations” while “liberating workers” from mundane and repetitive tasks. But they are also liberating plenty of people from their jobs. Independent experts say that major corporate R.P.A. initiatives have been followed by rounds of layoffs, and that cutting costs, not improving workplace conditions, is usually the driving factor behind the decision to automate. Craig Le Clair, an analyst with Forrester Research who studies the corporate automation market, said that for executives, much of the appeal of R.P.A. bots is that they are cheap, easy to use and compatible with their existing back-end systems. He said that companies often rely on them to juice short-term profits, rather than embarking on more expensive tech upgrades that might take years to pay for themselves. “It’s not a moonshot project like a lot of A.I., so companies are doing it like crazy,” Mr. Le Clair said. “With R.P.A., you can build a bot that costs $10,000 a year and take out two to four humans.” Covid-19 has led some companies to turn to automation to deal with growing demand, closed offices, or budget constraints. But for other companies, the pandemic has provided cover for executives to implement ambitious automation plans they dreamed up long ago. “Automation is more politically acceptable now,” said Raul Vega, the chief executive of Auxis, a firm that helps companies automate their operations. Before the pandemic, Mr. Vega said, some executives turned down offers to automate their call centers, or shrink their finance departments, because they worried about scaring their remaining workers or provoking a backlash like the one that followed the outsourcing boom of the 1990s, when C.E.O.s became villains for sending jobs to Bangalore and Shenzhen. But those concerns matter less now, with millions of people already out of work and many businesses struggling to stay afloat. Now, Mr. Vega said, “they don’t really care, they’re just going to do what’s right for their business.” Sales of automation software are expected to rise by 20 percent this year, after increasing by 12 percent last year, according to the research firm Gartner. And the consulting firm McKinsey, which predicted before the pandemic that 37 million U.S. workers would be displaced by automation by 2030, recently increased its projection to 45 million. A white-collar wake-up call Image Holly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto, oversees an automation project named “robotic process automation.”Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Not all bots are the job-destroying kind. Holly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto Insurance Companies, said that her firm has used automation to do 173,000 hours’ worth of work in areas like underwriting and human resources without laying anyone off. “People are concerned that there’s a possibility of losing their jobs, or not having anything to do,” she said. “But once we have a bot in the area, and people see how automation is applied, they’re truly thrilled that they don’t have to do that work anymore.” As bots become capable of complex decision-making, rather than doing single repetitive tasks, their disruptive potential is growing. Recent studies by researchers at Stanford University and the Brookings Institution compared the text of job listings with the wording of A.I.-related patents, looking for phrases like “make prediction” and “generate recommendation” that appeared in both. They found that the groups with the highest exposure to A.I. were better-paid, better-educated workers in technical and supervisory roles, with men, white and Asian-American workers, and midcareer professionals being some of the most endangered. Workers with bachelor’s or graduate degrees were nearly four times as exposed to A.I. risk as those with just a high school degree, the researchers found, and residents of high-tech cities like Seattle and Salt Lake City were more vulnerable than workers in smaller, more rural communities. “A lot of professional work combines some element of routine information processing with an element of judgment and discretion,” said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. who studies the labor effects of automation. “That’s where software has always fallen short. But with A.I., that type of work is much more in the kill path.” Many of those vulnerable workers don’t see this coming, in part because the effects of white-collar automation are often couched in jargon and euphemism. On their websites, R.P.A. firms promote glowing testimonials from their customers, often glossing over the parts that involve actual humans. “Sprint Automates 50 Business Processes In Just Six Months.” (Possible translation: Sprint replaced 300 people in the billing department.) “Dai-ichi Life Insurance Saves 132,000 Hours Annually” (Bye-bye, claims adjusters.) “600% Productivity Gain for Credit Reporting Giant with R.P.A.” (Don’t let the door hit you, data analysts.) Jason Kingdon, the chief executive of the R.P.A. firm Blue Prism, speaks in the softened vernacular of displacement too. He refers to his company’s bots as “digital workers,” and he explained that the economic shock of the pandemic had “massively raised awareness” among executives about the variety of work that no longer requires human involvement. “We think any business process can be automated,” he said. Mr. Kingdon tells business leaders that between half and two-thirds of all the tasks currently being done at their companies can be done by machines. Ultimately, he sees a future in which humans will collaborate side-by-side with teams of digital employees, with plenty of work for everyone, although he conceded that the robots have certain natural advantages. “A digital worker,” he said, “can be scaled in a vastly more flexible way.” The danger of so-so automation Image Self-checkout machines don’t help customers, they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift.Credit...Andrew Spear for The New York Times Humans have feared losing our jobs to machines for millennia. (In 350 BCE, Aristotle worried that self-playing harps would make musicians obsolete.) And yet, automation has never created mass unemployment, in part because technology has always generated new jobs to replace the ones it destroyed. During the 19th and 20th centuries, some lamplighters and blacksmiths became obsolete, but more people were able to make a living as electricians and car dealers. And today’s A.I. optimists argue that while new technology may displace some workers, it will spur economic growth and create better, more fulfilling jobs, just as it has in the past. But that is no guarantee, and there is growing evidence that this time may be different. In a series of recent studies, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, two well-respected economists who have researched the history of automation, found that for most of the 20th century, the optimistic take on automation prevailed — on average, in industries that implemented automation, new tasks were created faster than old ones were destroyed. Since the late 1980s, they found, the equation had flipped — tasks have been disappearing to automation faster than new ones are appearing. This shift may be related to the popularity of what they call “so-so automation” — technology that is just barely good enough to replace human workers, but not good enough to create new jobs or make companies significantly more productive. A common example of so-so automation is the grocery store self-checkout machine. These machines don’t cause customers to buy more groceries, or help them shop significantly faster — they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift. This simple, substitutive kind of automation, Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Restrepo wrote, threatens not just individual workers, but the economy as a whole. “The real danger for labor,” they wrote, “may come not from highly productive but from ‘so-so’ automation technologies that are just productive enough to be adopted and cause displacement.” Only the most devoted Luddites would argue against automating any job, no matter how menial or dangerous. But not all automation is created equal, and much of the automation being done in white-collar workplaces today is the kind that may not help workers over the long run. During past eras of technological change, governments and labor unions have stepped in to fight for automation-prone workers, or support them while they trained for new jobs. But this time, there is less in the way of help. Congress has rejected calls to fund federal worker retraining programs for years, and while some of the money in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill Democrats hope to pass this week will go to laid-off and furloughed workers, none of it is specifically earmarked for job training programs that could help displaced workers get back on their feet. Another key difference is that in the past, automation arrived gradually, factory machine by factory machine. But today’s white-collar automation is so sudden — and often, so deliberately obscured by management — that few workers have time to prepare. “The rate of progression of this technology is faster than any previous automation,” said Mr. Le Clair, the Forrester analyst, who thinks we are closer to the beginning than the end of the corporate A.I. boom. “We haven’t hit the exponential point of this stuff yet,” he added. “And when we do, it’s going to be dramatic.” Finding a robot-proof future The corporate world’s automation fever isn’t purely about getting rid of workers. Executives have shareholders and boards to satisfy, and competitors to keep up with. And some automation does, in fact, lift all boats, making workers’ jobs better and more interesting while allowing companies to do more with less. But as A.I. enters the corporate world, it is forcing workers at all levels to adapt, and focus on developing the kinds of distinctly human skills that machines can’t easily replicate. Ellen Wengert, a former data processor at an Australian insurance firm, learned this lesson four years ago, when she arrived at work one day to find a bot-builder sitting in her seat. The man, coincidentally an old classmate of hers, worked for a consulting firm that specialized in R.P.A. He explained that he’d been hired to automate her job, which mostly involved moving customer data from one database to another. He then asked her to, essentially, train her own replacement — teaching him how to do the steps involved in her job so that he, in turn, could program a bot to do the same thing. Ms. Wengert wasn’t exactly surprised. She’d known that her job was straightforward and repetitive, making it low-hanging fruit for automation. But she was annoyed that her managers seemed so eager to hand it over to a machine. “They were desperate to create this sense of excitement around automation,” she said. “Most of my colleagues got on board with that pretty readily, but I found it really jarring, to be feigning excitement about us all potentially losing our jobs.” For Ms. Wengert, 27, the experience was a wake-up call. She had a college degree and was early in her career. But some of her colleagues had been happily doing the same job for years, and she worried that they would fall through the cracks. “Even though these aren’t glamorous jobs, there are a lot of people doing them,” she said. She left the insurance company after her contract ended. And she now works as a second-grade teacher — a job she says she sought out, in part, because it seemed harder to automate. Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, is the author of the new book “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation,” from which this essay is adapted.

Goodman Published March 26, 2021Updated March 29, 2021 Leer en español阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版 [Update: After nearly a week, the Ever Given, the mammoth container ship stuck in the Suez Canal, has been freed.] LONDON — The world got another warning this week about the perils of its heavy reliance on global supply chains. As a single ship ran aground in the Suez Canal, shutting down traffic in both directions, international commerce confronted a monumental traffic jam with potentially grave consequences. The troubled craft is not just any vessel. The Ever Given is one of the world’s largest container ships, with space for 20,000 metal boxes carrying goods across the sea. And the Suez Canal is not just any waterway. It is a vital channel linking the factories of Asia to the affluent customers of Europe, as well as a major conduit for oil. The fact that one mishap could sow fresh chaos from Los Angeles to Rotterdam to Shanghai underscored the extent to which modern commerce has come to revolve around truly global supply chains. In recent decades, management experts and consulting firms have championed so-called just-in-time manufacturing to limit costs and boost profits. Rather than waste money stockpiling extra goods in warehouses, companies can depend on the magic of the internet and the global shipping industry to summon what they need as they need it. The embrace of this idea has delivered no less than a revolution to major industries — automotive and medical device manufacturing, retailing, pharmaceuticals and more. It has also yielded a bonanza for corporate executives and other shareholders: Money not spent filling warehouses with unneeded auto parts is, at least in part, money that can be given to shareholders in the form of dividends. Yet, as in everything in life, overdoing a good thing can bring danger. An excessive reliance on just-in-time manufacturing helps explain how medical staff from Indiana to Italy found themselves attending to Covid-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic without adequate protective gear like masks and gowns. Image The Ever Given, which ran aground on Tuesday, has space for 20,000 metal boxes carrying goods.Credit...Suez Canal Authority, via Reuters Health care systems — many under the control of profit-making companies answerable to shareholders — assumed that they could depend on the web and the global shipping industry to deliver what they needed in real time. That proved a deadly miscalculation. The same dependence explains how Amazon failed to provide adequate stocks of masks and gloves to its warehouse workers in the United States in the first months of the pandemic. “We’ve placed purchase orders for millions of face masks we want to give to our employees and contractors who cannot work from home, but very few of those orders have been filled,” Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, declared in a letter to all employees last March. “Masks remain in short supply globally.” Some experts have warned for years that short-term shareholder interests have eclipsed prudent management in prompting companies to skimp on stockpiling goods. “As we become more interdependent, we are even more subject to the fragilities that arise, and they are always unpredictable,” said Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization at Oxford University. “No one could predict a ship going aground in the middle of the canal, just like no one predicted where the pandemic would come from. Just like we can’t predict the next cyberattack, or the next financial crisis, but we know it’s going to happen.” The disaster of the moment, in which engineers work to extract an enormous vessel from the Suez Canal, has left more than 100 vessels stuck at either end awaiting clear passage. Some are carrying oil — a reason that energy prices rose on Wednesday, though they pulled back on Thursday. Some are carrying electronics, and clothing, and exercise equipment. None of them are getting where they are supposed to until the waylaid ship is freed. Each day the stalemate continues holds up goods worth $9.6 billion, according to a Bloomberg analysis. Ever since its deployment in the 1950s, the shipping container has itself revolutionized global trade. As a standard-size receptacle that can be quickly plunked onto rail lines and trucks, it has sharply reduced the time needed to move goods from one place to another. Image Ships anchored midway through the Suez Canal on Thursday. Credit...Sam Madgy/Associated Press Exponential increases in how many containers may be piled atop a single ship have effectively shrunk the globe further. Capacity has increased 1,500 percent over the last half-century, and has nearly doubled over the last decade alone, according to Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty, a shipping insurance company. These advances in trade have yielded sophisticated and highly efficient forms of specialization, with auto factories in the north of England relying on parts from across Europe and Asia. The rise of the container ship has expanded the availability of consumer goods and lowered prices. But these same advances have yielded vulnerabilities, and the disruption at the Suez Canal — the passageway for roughly one-tenth of the world’s trade — has intensified the strains on the shipping industry, which has been overwhelmed by the pandemic and its reordering of world trade. As Americans have contended with lockdowns, they have ordered vast quantities of factory goods from Asia: exercise bikes to compensate for the closure of gyms; printers and computer monitors to turn bedrooms into offices; baking equipment and toys to entertain children cooped up at home. The surge of orders has exhausted the supply of containers at ports in China. The cost of shipping a container from Asia to North America has more than doubled since November. And at ports from Los Angeles to Seattle, the unloading of those containers has been slowed as dockworkers and truck drivers have been struck by Covid-19 or forced to stay home to attend to children who are out of school. Image Disruptions in trade caused by the pandemic have stymied key U.S. ports like Los Angeles.Credit...Coley Brown for The New York Times Delays in unloading spell delays in loading the next shipment. Agricultural exporters in the American Midwest have struggled to secure containers to send soybeans and grains to food processors and animal feed suppliers in Southeast Asia. This situation has held for four months, while showing few signs of easing. Retailers in North America have been frantically restocking depleted inventories, putting a strain on shipping companies in what is normally the slack season on trans-Pacific routes. The blockage of the Suez Canal effectively sidelines more containers. The question is how long this lasts. Two weeks could strand as much as one-fourth of the supply of containers that would normally be in European ports, estimated Christian Roeloffs, chief executive officer of xChange, a shipping consultant in Hamburg, Germany. “Considering the current container shortage, it just increases the turnaround time for the ships,” Mr. Roeloffs said. Three-fourths of all container ships traveling from Asia to Europe arrived late in February, according to Sea-Intelligence, a research company in Copenhagen. Even a few days of disruption in the Suez could exacerbate that situation. If the Suez remains clogged for more than a few days, the stakes would rise drastically. Ships now stuck in the canal will find it difficult to turn around and pursue other routes given the narrowness of the channel. Those now en route to the Suez may opt to head south and navigate around Africa, adding weeks to their journeys and burning additional fuel — a cost ultimately borne by consumers. Whenever ships again move through the canal, they are likely to arrive at busy ports all at once, forcing many to wait before they can unload — an additional delay. “This could make a really bad crisis even worse,” said Alan Murphy, the founder of Sea-Intelligence.

Not to kill you with lasers, or beat you in chess, or even to ferry you around town in a driverless Uber. These robots are here to merge purchase orders into columns J and K of next quarter’s revenue forecast, and transfer customer data from the invoicing software to the Oracle database. They are unassuming software programs with names like “Auxiliobits — DataTable To Json String,” and they are becoming the star employees at many American companies. Some of these tools are simple apps, downloaded from online stores and installed by corporate I.T. departments, that do the dull-but-critical tasks that someone named Phil in Accounting used to do: reconciling bank statements, approving expense reports, reviewing tax forms. Others are expensive, custom-built software packages, armed with more sophisticated types of artificial intelligence, that are capable of doing the kinds of cognitive work that once required teams of highly-paid humans. White-collar workers, armed with college degrees and specialized training, once felt relatively safe from automation. But recent advances in A.I. and machine learning have created algorithms capable of outperforming doctors, lawyers and bankers at certain parts of their jobs. And as bots learn to do higher-value tasks, they are climbing the corporate ladder. The trend — quietly building for years, but accelerating to warp speed since the pandemic — goes by the sleepy moniker “robotic process automation.” And it is transforming workplaces at a pace that few outsiders appreciate. Nearly 8 in 10 corporate executives surveyed by Deloitte last year said they had implemented some form of R.P.A. Another 16 percent said they planned to do so within three years. Most of this automation is being done by companies you’ve probably never heard of. UiPath, the largest stand-alone automation firm, is valued at $35 billion — roughly the size of eBay — and is slated to go public later this year. Other companies like Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism, which have Fortune 500 companies like Coca-Cola and Walgreens Boots Alliance as clients, are also enjoying breakneck growth, and tech giants like Microsoft have recently introduced their own automation products to get in on the action. Executives generally spin these bots as being good for everyone, “streamlining operations” while “liberating workers” from mundane and repetitive tasks. But they are also liberating plenty of people from their jobs. Independent experts say that major corporate R.P.A. initiatives have been followed by rounds of layoffs, and that cutting costs, not improving workplace conditions, is usually the driving factor behind the decision to automate. Craig Le Clair, an analyst with Forrester Research who studies the corporate automation market, said that for executives, much of the appeal of R.P.A. bots is that they are cheap, easy to use and compatible with their existing back-end systems. He said that companies often rely on them to juice short-term profits, rather than embarking on more expensive tech upgrades that might take years to pay for themselves. “It’s not a moonshot project like a lot of A.I., so companies are doing it like crazy,” Mr. Le Clair said. “With R.P.A., you can build a bot that costs $10,000 a year and take out two to four humans.” Covid-19 has led some companies to turn to automation to deal with growing demand, closed offices, or budget constraints. But for other companies, the pandemic has provided cover for executives to implement ambitious automation plans they dreamed up long ago. “Automation is more politically acceptable now,” said Raul Vega, the chief executive of Auxis, a firm that helps companies automate their operations. Before the pandemic, Mr. Vega said, some executives turned down offers to automate their call centers, or shrink their finance departments, because they worried about scaring their remaining workers or provoking a backlash like the one that followed the outsourcing boom of the 1990s, when C.E.O.s became villains for sending jobs to Bangalore and Shenzhen. But those concerns matter less now, with millions of people already out of work and many businesses struggling to stay afloat. Now, Mr. Vega said, “they don’t really care, they’re just going to do what’s right for their business.” Sales of automation software are expected to rise by 20 percent this year, after increasing by 12 percent last year, according to the research firm Gartner. And the consulting firm McKinsey, which predicted before the pandemic that 37 million U.S. workers would be displaced by automation by 2030, recently increased its projection to 45 million. A white-collar wake-up call Image Holly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto, oversees an automation project named “robotic process automation.”Credit...Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Not all bots are the job-destroying kind. Holly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto Insurance Companies, said that her firm has used automation to do 173,000 hours’ worth of work in areas like underwriting and human resources without laying anyone off. “People are concerned that there’s a possibility of losing their jobs, or not having anything to do,” she said. “But once we have a bot in the area, and people see how automation is applied, they’re truly thrilled that they don’t have to do that work anymore.” As bots become capable of complex decision-making, rather than doing single repetitive tasks, their disruptive potential is growing. Today in Business Live Updates: Updated April 2, 2021, 3:58 p.m. ET Major League Baseball pulls All-Star Game from Georgia over voting law. Today in On Tech: Biden’s plan to fix America’s internet. The C.E.O. of the self-driving car company Waymo will step down after more than 5 years. Recent studies by researchers at Stanford University and the Brookings Institution compared the text of job listings with the wording of A.I.-related patents, looking for phrases like “make prediction” and “generate recommendation” that appeared in both. They found that the groups with the highest exposure to A.I. were better-paid, better-educated workers in technical and supervisory roles, with men, white and Asian-American workers, and midcareer professionals being some of the most endangered. Workers with bachelor’s or graduate degrees were nearly four times as exposed to A.I. risk as those with just a high school degree, the researchers found, and residents of high-tech cities like Seattle and Salt Lake City were more vulnerable than workers in smaller, more rural communities. “A lot of professional work combines some element of routine information processing with an element of judgment and discretion,” said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. who studies the labor effects of automation. “That’s where software has always fallen short. But with A.I., that type of work is much more in the kill path.” Many of those vulnerable workers don’t see this coming, in part because the effects of white-collar automation are often couched in jargon and euphemism. On their websites, R.P.A. firms promote glowing testimonials from their customers, often glossing over the parts that involve actual humans. “Sprint Automates 50 Business Processes In Just Six Months.” (Possible translation: Sprint replaced 300 people in the billing department.) “Dai-ichi Life Insurance Saves 132,000 Hours Annually” (Bye-bye, claims adjusters.) “600% Productivity Gain for Credit Reporting Giant with R.P.A.” (Don’t let the door hit you, data analysts.) Jason Kingdon, the chief executive of the R.P.A. firm Blue Prism, speaks in the softened vernacular of displacement too. He refers to his company’s bots as “digital workers,” and he explained that the economic shock of the pandemic had “massively raised awareness” among executives about the variety of work that no longer requires human involvement. “We think any business process can be automated,” he said. Mr. Kingdon tells business leaders that between half and two-thirds of all the tasks currently being done at their companies can be done by machines. Ultimately, he sees a future in which humans will collaborate side-by-side with teams of digital employees, with plenty of work for everyone, although he conceded that the robots have certain natural advantages. “A digital worker,” he said, “can be scaled in a vastly more flexible way.” The danger of so-so automation Image Self-checkout machines don’t help customers, they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift.Credit...Andrew Spear for The New York Times Humans have feared losing our jobs to machines for millennia. (In 350 BCE, Aristotle worried that self-playing harps would make musicians obsolete.) And yet, automation has never created mass unemployment, in part because technology has always generated new jobs to replace the ones it destroyed. During the 19th and 20th centuries, some lamplighters and blacksmiths became obsolete, but more people were able to make a living as electricians and car dealers. And today’s A.I. optimists argue that while new technology may displace some workers, it will spur economic growth and create better, more fulfilling jobs, just as it has in the past. But that is no guarantee, and there is growing evidence that this time may be different. In a series of recent studies, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, two well-respected economists who have researched the history of automation, found that for most of the 20th century, the optimistic take on automation prevailed — on average, in industries that implemented automation, new tasks were created faster than old ones were destroyed. Since the late 1980s, they found, the equation had flipped — tasks have been disappearing to automation faster than new ones are appearing. This shift may be related to the popularity of what they call “so-so automation” — technology that is just barely good enough to replace human workers, but not good enough to create new jobs or make companies significantly more productive. A common example of so-so automation is the grocery store self-checkout machine. These machines don’t cause customers to buy more groceries, or help them shop significantly faster — they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift. This simple, substitutive kind of automation, Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Restrepo wrote, threatens not just individual workers, but the economy as a whole. “The real danger for labor,” they wrote, “may come not from highly productive but from ‘so-so’ automation technologies that are just productive enough to be adopted and cause displacement.” Only the most devoted Luddites would argue against automating any job, no matter how menial or dangerous. But not all automation is created equal, and much of the automation being done in white-collar workplaces today is the kind that may not help workers over the long run. During past eras of technological change, governments and labor unions have stepped in to fight for automation-prone workers, or support them while they trained for new jobs. But this time, there is less in the way of help. Congress has rejected calls to fund federal worker retraining programs for years, and while some of the money in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill Democrats hope to pass this week will go to laid-off and furloughed workers, none of it is specifically earmarked for job training programs that could help displaced workers get back on their feet. Another key difference is that in the past, automation arrived gradually, factory machine by factory machine. But today’s white-collar automation is so sudden — and often, so deliberately obscured by management — that few workers have time to prepare. “The rate of progression of this technology is faster than any previous automation,” said Mr. Le Clair, the Forrester analyst, who thinks we are closer to the beginning than the end of the corporate A.I. boom. “We haven’t hit the exponential point of this stuff yet,” he added. “And when we do, it’s going to be dramatic.” Finding a robot-proof future The corporate world’s automation fever isn’t purely about getting rid of workers. Executives have shareholders and boards to satisfy, and competitors to keep up with. And some automation does, in fact, lift all boats, making workers’ jobs better and more interesting while allowing companies to do more with less. But as A.I. enters the corporate world, it is forcing workers at all levels to adapt, and focus on developing the kinds of distinctly human skills that machines can’t easily replicate. Ellen Wengert, a former data processor at an Australian insurance firm, learned this lesson four years ago, when she arrived at work one day to find a bot-builder sitting in her seat. The man, coincidentally an old classmate of hers, worked for a consulting firm that specialized in R.P.A. He explained that he’d been hired to automate her job, which mostly involved moving customer data from one database to another. He then asked her to, essentially, train her own replacement — teaching him how to do the steps involved in her job so that he, in turn, could program a bot to do the same thing. Ms. Wengert wasn’t exactly surprised. She’d known that her job was straightforward and repetitive, making it low-hanging fruit for automation. But she was annoyed that her managers seemed so eager to hand it over to a machine. “They were desperate to create this sense of excitement around automation,” she said. “Most of my colleagues got on board with that pretty readily, but I found it really jarring, to be feigning excitement about us all potentially losing our jobs.” For Ms. Wengert, 27, the experience was a wake-up call. She had a college degree and was early in her career. But some of her colleagues had been happily doing the same job for years, and she worried that they would fall through the cracks. “Even though these aren’t glamorous jobs, there are a lot of people doing them,” she said. She left the insurance company after her contract ended. And she now works as a second-grade teacher — a job she says she sought out, in part, because it seemed harder to automate. Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, is the author of the new book “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation,” from which this essay is adapted.

By Neil Irwin Published March 13, 2021Updated March 17, 2021 Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk The 21st-century economy has been a two-decade series of punches in the gut. The century began in economic triumphalism in the United States, with a sense that business cycles had been vanquished and prosperity secured for a blindingly bright future. Instead, a mild recession was followed by a weak recovery followed by a financial crisis followed by another weak recovery followed by a pandemic-induced collapse. A couple of good years right before the pandemic aside, it has been two decades of overwhelming inequality and underwhelming growth — an economy in which a persistently weak job market has left vast human potential untapped, helping fuel social and political dysfunction. Those two decades coincide almost precisely with my career as an economics writer. It is the reason, among my colleagues, I have a reputation for writing stories that run the gamut from ominous to gloomy to terrifying. But strange as it may seem in this time of pandemic, I’m starting to get optimistic. It’s an odd feeling, because so many people are suffering — and because for so much of my career, a gloomy outlook has been the correct one. Predictions are a hard business, of course, and much could go wrong that makes the decades ahead as bad as, or worse than, the recent past. But this optimism is not just about the details of the new pandemic relief legislation or the politics of the moment. Rather, it stems from a diagnosis of three problematic mega-trends, all related. There has been a dearth of economy-altering innovation, the kind that fuels rapid growth in the economy’s productive potential. There has been a global glut of labor because of a period of rapid globalization and technological change that reduced workers’ bargaining power in rich countries. And there has been persistently inadequate demand for goods and services that government policy has been unable to fix. There is not one reason, however, to think that these negative trends have run their course. There are 17. Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk 1. The ketchup might be ready to flow In 1987, the economist Robert Solow said, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” Companies were making great use of rapid improvements in computing power, but the overall economy wasn’t really becoming more productive. This analysis was right until it was wrong. Starting around the mid-1990s, technological innovations in supply chain management and factory production enabled companies to squeeze more economic output out of every hour of work and dollar of capital spending. This was an important reason for the economic boom of the late 1990s. The Solow paradox, as the idea underlying his quote would later be called, reflected an insight: An innovation, no matter how revolutionary, will often have little effect on the larger economy immediately after it is invented. It often takes many years before businesses figure out exactly what they have and how it can be used, and years more to work out kinks and bring costs down. In the beginning, it may even lower productivity! In the 1980s, companies that tried out new computing technology often needed to employ new armies of programmers as well as others to maintain old, redundant systems. But once such hurdles are cleared, the innovation can spread with dizzying speed. It’s like the old ditty: “Shake and shake the ketchup bottle. First none will come and then a lot’ll.” Or, in a more formal sense, the economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Chad Syverson call this the “productivity J-curve,” in which an important new general-purpose technology — they use artificial intelligence as a contemporary example — initially depresses apparent productivity, but over time unleashes much stronger growth in economic potential. It looks as if companies have been putting in a lot of work for no return, but once those returns start to flow, they come faster than once seemed imaginable. There are several areas where innovation seems to be at just such a point, and not just artificial intelligence. 2. 2020s battery technology looks kind of like 1990s microprocessors Remember Moore’s Law? It was the idea that the number of transistors that could be put on an integrated circuit would double every two years as manufacturing technology improved. That is the reason you may well be wearing a watch with more computer processing power than the devices that sent people into outer space in the 1960s. Battery technology isn’t improving at quite that pace, but it’s not far behind it. The price of lithium-ion battery packs has fallen 89 percent in inflation-adjusted terms since 2010, according to BloombergNEF, and is poised for further declines. There have been similar advances in solar cells, raising the prospect of more widespread inexpensive clean energy. Another similarity: Microprocessors and batteries are not ends unto themselves, but rather technologies that enable lots of other innovation. Fast, cheap computer chips led to software that revolutionized the modern economy; cheap batteries and solar cells could lead to a wave of innovation around how energy is generated and used. We’re only at the early stages of that process. 3. Emerging innovations can combine in unexpected ways In the early part of the 20th century, indoor plumbing was sweeping the nation. So was home electricity. But the people installing those pipes and those power lines presumably had no idea that by the 1920s, the widespread availability of electricity and free-flowing water in homes would enable the adoption of the home washing machine, a device that saved Americans vast amounts of time and backbreaking labor. It required not just electricity and running water, but also revolutions in manufacturing techniques, production and distribution. All those innovations combined to make domestic life much easier. Could a combination of technologies now maturing create more improvement in living standards than any of them could in isolation? Consider driverless cars and trucks. They will rely on long-building research in artificial intelligence software, sensors and batteries. After years of hype, billions of dollars in investment, and millions of miles of test drives, the possibilities are starting to come into view. Waymo, a sister company of Google, has opened a driverless taxi service to the public in the Phoenix suburbs. Major companies including General Motors, Tesla and Apple are in the hunt as well, along with many smaller competitors. Apply the same logic to health care, to warehousing and heavy industry, and countless other fields. Inventions maturing now could be combined in new ways we can’t yet imagine. 4. The pandemic has taught us how to work remotely Being cooped up at home may pay some surprising economic dividends. As companies and workers have learned how to operate remotely, it could allow more people in places that are less expensive and that have fewer high-paying jobs to be more productive. It could enable companies to operate with less office space per employee, which in economic terms means less capital needed to generate the same output. And it could mean a reduction in commuting time. Even after the pandemic recedes, if only 10 percent of office workers took advantage of more remote work, that would have big implications for the United States’ economic future — bad news if you are a landlord in an expensive downtown perhaps, but good news for overall growth prospects. 5. Even Robert Gordon is (a little) more optimistic! Mr. Gordon wrote the book on America’s shortfall in innovation and productivity in recent decades — a 784-page book in 2016, to be precise. Now Mr. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, is kind of, sort of, moderately optimistic. “I would fully expect growth in the decade of the 2020s to be higher than it was in the 2010s, but not as fast as it was between 1995 and 2005,” he said recently. Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk 6. Crises spur innovation The mobilization to fight World War II was a remarkable feat. Business and government worked together to drastically increase the productive capacity of the economy, put millions to work, and advance countless innovations like synthetic rubber and the mass production of aircraft. Similarly, the Cold War generated a wave of public investment and innovation, such as satellites (a byproduct of the space race) and the internet (originally intended to provide decentralized communication in the event of a nuclear attack). Could our current crises spur similar ambition? Already the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the usage of mRNA technology for creating new vaccines, which could have far-reaching consequences for preventing disease. And as the 2020s progress, the deepening sense of urgency to reduce carbon emissions and cope with the fallout of climate change is the sort of all-encompassing challenge that could prove as galvanizing as those experiences — with similar implications for investment and innovation. Biden’s Agenda › Politics Updates Updated May 7, 2021, 3:17 p.m. ET Florida passed a new voting law. Here’s what’s in it. Prosecutors start to seek plea deals in Capitol riot cases. Janet Yellen says the economy faces a ‘somewhat bumpy’ recovery. 7. Tight labor markets spur innovation, too Why did the Industrial Revolution begin in Britain instead of somewhere else? One theory is that relatively high wages there (a result of international trade) created an urgency for firms to substitute machinery for human labor. Over time, finding ways to do more with fewer workers generated higher incomes and living standards. But why might the labor market of the 2020s be a tight one? It boils down to two big ideas: shifts in the global economy and demographics that make workers scarcer in the coming decade than in recent ones; and a newfound and bipartisan determination on the part of policymakers in Washington to achieve full employment. 8. There’s only one China Imagine an isolated farm town with 100 people. Five of the 100 own the farms. An additional 10 act as managers on behalf of the owners. And there are five intellectuals who sit around thinking big thoughts. The other 80 people are laborers. What would happen if suddenly another 80 laborers showed up, people who were used to lower living standards? The intellectuals might tell a complex story about how the influx of labor would eventually make everyone better off, as more land was cultivated and workers could specialize more. The owners and their managers would be happy because they would be instantly richer (they could pay people less to plow the fields). But the existing 80 laborers — competing for their jobs with an influx of lower-paid people — would see only immediate pain. The long-term argument that everybody gets richer in the end wouldn’t carry much weight. That’s essentially what has happened in the last few decades as China has gone from being isolated to being deeply integrated in the world economy. When the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, its population of 1.28 billion was bigger than that of the combined 34 advanced countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1.16 billion). But that was a one-time adjustment, and wages are rising rapidly in China as it moves beyond low-end manufacturing and toward more sophisticated goods. India, the only other country with comparable population, is already well integrated into the world economy. To the degree globalization continues, it should be a more gradual process. 9. There’s only one Mexico For years, American workers were also coming into competition with lower-earning Mexicans after enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. As with China, the new dynamic improved the long-term economic prospects for the United States, but in the short run it was bad for many American factory workers. But it too was a one-time adjustment. Even before President Trump, trade agreements under negotiation were for the most part no longer focused on making it easier to import from low- labor-cost countries. The main aim was to improve trade rules for American companies doing business in other rich countries. 10. The offshoring revolution is mostly played out Once upon a time, if you were an American company that needed to operate a customer service call center or carry out some labor-intensive information technology work, you had no real choice but to hire a bunch of Americans to do it. The emergence of inexpensive, instant global telecommunication changed that, allowing you to put work wherever costs were the lowest. In the first decade of the 2000s, American companies did just that on mass scale, locating work in countries like India and the Philippines. It’s a slightly different version of the earlier analogy involving the farm; a customer service operator in Kansas was suddenly in competition with millions of lower-earning Indians for a job. But it’s not as if the internet can be invented a second time. Sensing a theme here? In the early years of the 21st century, a combination of globalization and technological advancements put American workers in competition with billions of workers around the world. It created a dynamic in which workers had less bargaining power, and companies could achieve cost savings not by creating more innovative ways of doing things but exploiting a form of labor cost arbitrage. That may not be the case in the 2020s. Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk 11. Baby boomers can’t work forever The surge of births that took place in the two decades after World War II created a huge generation with long-reaching consequences for the economy. Now, their ages ranging from 57 to 76, the baby boomers are retiring, and that means opportunity for the generations that came behind them. As the boomers seek to continue consuming — spending their amassed savings, pensions and Social Security benefits — there will be relatively stable demand for goods and services and a relatively smaller pool of workers to produce them. According to the Social Security Administration’s projections of the so-called “dependency ratio,” in 2030 for every 100 people in their prime working years of 20 to 64, there will be 81 people outside that age range. In 2020 that number was 73. That is bad news for public finances and for the headline rate of G.D.P. growth, but good news for those in the work force. It should give workers more leverage to demand raises and give employers incentives to invest in productivity-enhancing software or machinery. 12. The millennials are entering their prime Spending has a life cycle. Young adults don’t make much money. As they age, they start to earn more. Many start families and begin spending a lot more, buying houses and cars and everything else it takes to raise children. Then they tend to cut back on spending as the kids move out of the house. That, anyway, is what the data says takes place on average. The rate of consumption spending soars for Americans in their 20s and 30s, and peaks sometime in their late 40s. It’s probably not a coincidence that some of the best years for the American economy in recent generations were from 1983 to 2000, when the ultra-large baby boom generation was in that crucial high-spending period. Guess what generation is in that life phase in the 2020s? The millennials, an even larger generation than the boomers. They’ve had a rough young adulthood, starting their careers in the shadow of the Great Recession. But all that adult-ing they’re starting to do could have big, positive economic consequences for the decade ahead. 13. Everybody likes it hot Twelve years ago, a Democratic president took office at a time of economic crisis. He succeeded at ending the crisis, but the expansion that followed was a disappointment, with years of slow growth at a time millions were either unemployed or out of the work force entirely. The overwhelming tone of the economic policy discussion during those years, however, was different. President Obama spoke of his plans to reduce the budget deficit. Republicans in Congress demanded even more fiscal restraint. Top Federal Reserve officials fretted about inflation risks, even when unemployment was high and inflation persistently low. The Trump presidency changed that discussion. Even as tax cuts widened the budget deficit, interest rates stayed low. Even as the jobless rate fell to levels not seen in nearly five decades, inflation stayed low. It was evident, based on how the economy performed in 2018 and 2019, and up until the pandemic began, that the U.S. economy could run hotter than the Obama-era consensus seemed to allow. That insight has powerful implications for the 2020s. 14. Joe Biden wants to let it rip President Biden and congressional Democrats were determined to learn the lessons of the Obama era. Mr. Biden was deeply involved in that stimulus plan, which proved inadequate to the task of creating and sustaining a robust recovery. The lesson that Mr. Biden and the Democratic Party took from 2009 was straightforward: Do whatever it takes to get the economy humming, and the politics will work in your favor. That thinking helped lead to the $1.9 trillion relief bill signed on Thursday. 15. Jay Powell wants to let it rip “To call something hot, you need to see heat,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in 2019. That’s as good a summary of the Fed’s approach to the economy as any. In more formal terms, the Fed has a new framework for policy called “Flexible Average Inflation Targeting.” It is in effect a repudiation of past Fed strategies of pre-emptively slowing the economy to prevent an outbreak of inflation predicted by economic models. Now, the Fed says it will raise interest rates in response to actual inflation in the economy, not just forecasts, and will not act simply because the unemployment rate is lower than models say it can sustainably get. Nearly every time he speaks, Mr. Powell sounds like a true believer in the church of full employment. 16. Republicans are getting away from austerity politics Consider an event that took place less than three months ago (that may feel like three years ago): Overwhelming bipartisan majorities in Congress passed a $900 billion pandemic relief bill. Then a Republican president threatened to veto it, not because it was too generous, but because it was too stingy. President Trump didn’t get his way on increasing $600 payments to most Americans to $2,000 payments, and he signed the legislation anyway, grudgingly. But the episode reflects a shift away from the focus on fiscal austerity that prevailed in the Obama era. With the current stimulus bill, opposition in conservative talk radio was relatively muted. Republicans voted against it, but there hasn’t been quite the fire-and-brimstone sense of opposition evident toward the Obama stimulus a dozen years ago. As the party becomes more focused on the kinds of culture-war battles that Mr. Trump made his signature, and its base shifts away from business elites, it wouldn’t be surprising if we saw the end of an era in which cutting government spending was its animating idea. This would imply a U.S. government that aims to keep flooding the economy with cash no matter who wins the next few elections. 17. The post-pandemic era could start with a bang The last year has been terrible on nearly every level. But it’s easy to see the potential for the economy to burst out of the starting gate like an Olympic sprinter. That could have consequences beyond 2021. A rapid start to the post-pandemic economy could create a virtuous cycle in which consumers spend; companies hire and invest to fulfill that demand; and workers wind up having more money in their pockets to consume even more. Americans have saved an extra $1.8 trillion during the pandemic, reflecting government help and lower spending. That is money that people can spend in the months ahead, or it could give them a comfort level that they have adequate savings and can spend more of their earnings. Things are also primed for a boom time in the executive suite. C.E.O. confidence is at a 17-year high, and near-record stock market valuations imply that companies have access to very cheap capital. There is no reason corporate America can’t hire, invest and expand to take advantage of the post-pandemic surge in activity. And on a psychological level, doesn’t everybody desperately want to return to feeling a sense of joy, of exuberance? That is an emotion that could prove the most powerful economic force of them all. Economics may be a dismal science, and those of us who write about it are consigned to see what is broken in the world. But sometimes, things align in surprising ways, and the result is a period in which things really do get better. This is starting to look like one of those times.

By Neil Irwin Published March 13, 2021Updated March 17, 2021 Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk The 21st-century economy has been a two-decade series of punches in the gut. The century began in economic triumphalism in the United States, with a sense that business cycles had been vanquished and prosperity secured for a blindingly bright future. Instead, a mild recession was followed by a weak recovery followed by a financial crisis followed by another weak recovery followed by a pandemic-induced collapse. A couple of good years right before the pandemic aside, it has been two decades of overwhelming inequality and underwhelming growth — an economy in which a persistently weak job market has left vast human potential untapped, helping fuel social and political dysfunction. Those two decades coincide almost precisely with my career as an economics writer. It is the reason, among my colleagues, I have a reputation for writing stories that run the gamut from ominous to gloomy to terrifying. But strange as it may seem in this time of pandemic, I’m starting to get optimistic. It’s an odd feeling, because so many people are suffering — and because for so much of my career, a gloomy outlook has been the correct one. Predictions are a hard business, of course, and much could go wrong that makes the decades ahead as bad as, or worse than, the recent past. But this optimism is not just about the details of the new pandemic relief legislation or the politics of the moment. Rather, it stems from a diagnosis of three problematic mega-trends, all related. There has been a dearth of economy-altering innovation, the kind that fuels rapid growth in the economy’s productive potential. There has been a global glut of labor because of a period of rapid globalization and technological change that reduced workers’ bargaining power in rich countries. And there has been persistently inadequate demand for goods and services that government policy has been unable to fix. There is not one reason, however, to think that these negative trends have run their course. There are 17. Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk 1. The ketchup might be ready to flow In 1987, the economist Robert Solow said, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” Companies were making great use of rapid improvements in computing power, but the overall economy wasn’t really becoming more productive. This analysis was right until it was wrong. Starting around the mid-1990s, technological innovations in supply chain management and factory production enabled companies to squeeze more economic output out of every hour of work and dollar of capital spending. This was an important reason for the economic boom of the late 1990s. The Solow paradox, as the idea underlying his quote would later be called, reflected an insight: An innovation, no matter how revolutionary, will often have little effect on the larger economy immediately after it is invented. It often takes many years before businesses figure out exactly what they have and how it can be used, and years more to work out kinks and bring costs down. In the beginning, it may even lower productivity! In the 1980s, companies that tried out new computing technology often needed to employ new armies of programmers as well as others to maintain old, redundant systems. But once such hurdles are cleared, the innovation can spread with dizzying speed. It’s like the old ditty: “Shake and shake the ketchup bottle. First none will come and then a lot’ll.” Or, in a more formal sense, the economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Chad Syverson call this the “productivity J-curve,” in which an important new general-purpose technology — they use artificial intelligence as a contemporary example — initially depresses apparent productivity, but over time unleashes much stronger growth in economic potential. It looks as if companies have been putting in a lot of work for no return, but once those returns start to flow, they come faster than once seemed imaginable. There are several areas where innovation seems to be at just such a point, and not just artificial intelligence. 2. 2020s battery technology looks kind of like 1990s microprocessors Remember Moore’s Law? It was the idea that the number of transistors that could be put on an integrated circuit would double every two years as manufacturing technology improved. That is the reason you may well be wearing a watch with more computer processing power than the devices that sent people into outer space in the 1960s. Battery technology isn’t improving at quite that pace, but it’s not far behind it. The price of lithium-ion battery packs has fallen 89 percent in inflation-adjusted terms since 2010, according to BloombergNEF, and is poised for further declines. There have been similar advances in solar cells, raising the prospect of more widespread inexpensive clean energy. Another similarity: Microprocessors and batteries are not ends unto themselves, but rather technologies that enable lots of other innovation. Fast, cheap computer chips led to software that revolutionized the modern economy; cheap batteries and solar cells could lead to a wave of innovation around how energy is generated and used. We’re only at the early stages of that process. 3. Emerging innovations can combine in unexpected ways In the early part of the 20th century, indoor plumbing was sweeping the nation. So was home electricity. But the people installing those pipes and those power lines presumably had no idea that by the 1920s, the widespread availability of electricity and free-flowing water in homes would enable the adoption of the home washing machine, a device that saved Americans vast amounts of time and backbreaking labor. It required not just electricity and running water, but also revolutions in manufacturing techniques, production and distribution. All those innovations combined to make domestic life much easier. Could a combination of technologies now maturing create more improvement in living standards than any of them could in isolation? Consider driverless cars and trucks. They will rely on long-building research in artificial intelligence software, sensors and batteries. After years of hype, billions of dollars in investment, and millions of miles of test drives, the possibilities are starting to come into view. Waymo, a sister company of Google, has opened a driverless taxi service to the public in the Phoenix suburbs. Major companies including General Motors, Tesla and Apple are in the hunt as well, along with many smaller competitors. Apply the same logic to health care, to warehousing and heavy industry, and countless other fields. Inventions maturing now could be combined in new ways we can’t yet imagine. 4. The pandemic has taught us how to work remotely Being cooped up at home may pay some surprising economic dividends. As companies and workers have learned how to operate remotely, it could allow more people in places that are less expensive and that have fewer high-paying jobs to be more productive. It could enable companies to operate with less office space per employee, which in economic terms means less capital needed to generate the same output. And it could mean a reduction in commuting time. Even after the pandemic recedes, if only 10 percent of office workers took advantage of more remote work, that would have big implications for the United States’ economic future — bad news if you are a landlord in an expensive downtown perhaps, but good news for overall growth prospects. 5. Even Robert Gordon is (a little) more optimistic! Mr. Gordon wrote the book on America’s shortfall in innovation and productivity in recent decades — a 784-page book in 2016, to be precise. Now Mr. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, is kind of, sort of, moderately optimistic. “I would fully expect growth in the decade of the 2020s to be higher than it was in the 2010s, but not as fast as it was between 1995 and 2005,” he said recently. Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk 6. Crises spur innovation The mobilization to fight World War II was a remarkable feat. Business and government worked together to drastically increase the productive capacity of the economy, put millions to work, and advance countless innovations like synthetic rubber and the mass production of aircraft. Similarly, the Cold War generated a wave of public investment and innovation, such as satellites (a byproduct of the space race) and the internet (originally intended to provide decentralized communication in the event of a nuclear attack). Could our current crises spur similar ambition? Already the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the usage of mRNA technology for creating new vaccines, which could have far-reaching consequences for preventing disease. And as the 2020s progress, the deepening sense of urgency to reduce carbon emissions and cope with the fallout of climate change is the sort of all-encompassing challenge that could prove as galvanizing as those experiences — with similar implications for investment and innovation. Biden’s Agenda › Politics Updates Updated May 14, 2021, 3:44 p.m. ET An ex-Green Beret who spied for Russia was sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison. Consumers may be expecting higher inflation, posing potential trouble for the Fed. House Democrats press forward with a bipartisan proposal to create a commission on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. 7. Tight labor markets spur innovation, too Why did the Industrial Revolution begin in Britain instead of somewhere else? One theory is that relatively high wages there (a result of international trade) created an urgency for firms to substitute machinery for human labor. Over time, finding ways to do more with fewer workers generated higher incomes and living standards. But why might the labor market of the 2020s be a tight one? It boils down to two big ideas: shifts in the global economy and demographics that make workers scarcer in the coming decade than in recent ones; and a newfound and bipartisan determination on the part of policymakers in Washington to achieve full employment. 8. There’s only one China Imagine an isolated farm town with 100 people. Five of the 100 own the farms. An additional 10 act as managers on behalf of the owners. And there are five intellectuals who sit around thinking big thoughts. The other 80 people are laborers. What would happen if suddenly another 80 laborers showed up, people who were used to lower living standards? The intellectuals might tell a complex story about how the influx of labor would eventually make everyone better off, as more land was cultivated and workers could specialize more. The owners and their managers would be happy because they would be instantly richer (they could pay people less to plow the fields). But the existing 80 laborers — competing for their jobs with an influx of lower-paid people — would see only immediate pain. The long-term argument that everybody gets richer in the end wouldn’t carry much weight. That’s essentially what has happened in the last few decades as China has gone from being isolated to being deeply integrated in the world economy. When the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, its population of 1.28 billion was bigger than that of the combined 34 advanced countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1.16 billion). But that was a one-time adjustment, and wages are rising rapidly in China as it moves beyond low-end manufacturing and toward more sophisticated goods. India, the only other country with comparable population, is already well integrated into the world economy. To the degree globalization continues, it should be a more gradual process. 9. There’s only one Mexico For years, American workers were also coming into competition with lower-earning Mexicans after enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. As with China, the new dynamic improved the long-term economic prospects for the United States, but in the short run it was bad for many American factory workers. But it too was a one-time adjustment. Even before President Trump, trade agreements under negotiation were for the most part no longer focused on making it easier to import from low- labor-cost countries. The main aim was to improve trade rules for American companies doing business in other rich countries. 10. The offshoring revolution is mostly played out Once upon a time, if you were an American company that needed to operate a customer service call center or carry out some labor-intensive information technology work, you had no real choice but to hire a bunch of Americans to do it. The emergence of inexpensive, instant global telecommunication changed that, allowing you to put work wherever costs were the lowest. In the first decade of the 2000s, American companies did just that on mass scale, locating work in countries like India and the Philippines. It’s a slightly different version of the earlier analogy involving the farm; a customer service operator in Kansas was suddenly in competition with millions of lower-earning Indians for a job. But it’s not as if the internet can be invented a second time. Sensing a theme here? In the early years of the 21st century, a combination of globalization and technological advancements put American workers in competition with billions of workers around the world. It created a dynamic in which workers had less bargaining power, and companies could achieve cost savings not by creating more innovative ways of doing things but exploiting a form of labor cost arbitrage. That may not be the case in the 2020s. Image Credit...Jordy van den Nieuwendijk 11. Baby boomers can’t work forever The surge of births that took place in the two decades after World War II created a huge generation with long-reaching consequences for the economy. Now, their ages ranging from 57 to 76, the baby boomers are retiring, and that means opportunity for the generations that came behind them. As the boomers seek to continue consuming — spending their amassed savings, pensions and Social Security benefits — there will be relatively stable demand for goods and services and a relatively smaller pool of workers to produce them. According to the Social Security Administration’s projections of the so-called “dependency ratio,” in 2030 for every 100 people in their prime working years of 20 to 64, there will be 81 people outside that age range. In 2020 that number was 73. That is bad news for public finances and for the headline rate of G.D.P. growth, but good news for those in the work force. It should give workers more leverage to demand raises and give employers incentives to invest in productivity-enhancing software or machinery. 12. The millennials are entering their prime Spending has a life cycle. Young adults don’t make much money. As they age, they start to earn more. Many start families and begin spending a lot more, buying houses and cars and everything else it takes to raise children. Then they tend to cut back on spending as the kids move out of the house. That, anyway, is what the data says takes place on average. The rate of consumption spending soars for Americans in their 20s and 30s, and peaks sometime in their late 40s. It’s probably not a coincidence that some of the best years for the American economy in recent generations were from 1983 to 2000, when the ultra-large baby boom generation was in that crucial high-spending period. Guess what generation is in that life phase in the 2020s? The millennials, an even larger generation than the boomers. They’ve had a rough young adulthood, starting their careers in the shadow of the Great Recession. But all that adult-ing they’re starting to do could have big, positive economic consequences for the decade ahead. 13. Everybody likes it hot Twelve years ago, a Democratic president took office at a time of economic crisis. He succeeded at ending the crisis, but the expansion that followed was a disappointment, with years of slow growth at a time millions were either unemployed or out of the work force entirely. The overwhelming tone of the economic policy discussion during those years, however, was different. President Obama spoke of his plans to reduce the budget deficit. Republicans in Congress demanded even more fiscal restraint. Top Federal Reserve officials fretted about inflation risks, even when unemployment was high and inflation persistently low. The Trump presidency changed that discussion. Even as tax cuts widened the budget deficit, interest rates stayed low. Even as the jobless rate fell to levels not seen in nearly five decades, inflation stayed low. It was evident, based on how the economy performed in 2018 and 2019, and up until the pandemic began, that the U.S. economy could run hotter than the Obama-era consensus seemed to allow. That insight has powerful implications for the 2020s. 14. Joe Biden wants to let it rip President Biden and congressional Democrats were determined to learn the lessons of the Obama era. Mr. Biden was deeply involved in that stimulus plan, which proved inadequate to the task of creating and sustaining a robust recovery. The lesson that Mr. Biden and the Democratic Party took from 2009 was straightforward: Do whatever it takes to get the economy humming, and the politics will work in your favor. That thinking helped lead to the $1.9 trillion relief bill signed on Thursday. 15. Jay Powell wants to let it rip “To call something hot, you need to see heat,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in 2019. That’s as good a summary of the Fed’s approach to the economy as any. In more formal terms, the Fed has a new framework for policy called “Flexible Average Inflation Targeting.” It is in effect a repudiation of past Fed strategies of pre-emptively slowing the economy to prevent an outbreak of inflation predicted by economic models. Now, the Fed says it will raise interest rates in response to actual inflation in the economy, not just forecasts, and will not act simply because the unemployment rate is lower than models say it can sustainably get. Nearly every time he speaks, Mr. Powell sounds like a true believer in the church of full employment. 16. Republicans are getting away from austerity politics Consider an event that took place less than three months ago (that may feel like three years ago): Overwhelming bipartisan majorities in Congress passed a $900 billion pandemic relief bill. Then a Republican president threatened to veto it, not because it was too generous, but because it was too stingy. President Trump didn’t get his way on increasing $600 payments to most Americans to $2,000 payments, and he signed the legislation anyway, grudgingly. But the episode reflects a shift away from the focus on fiscal austerity that prevailed in the Obama era. With the current stimulus bill, opposition in conservative talk radio was relatively muted. Republicans voted against it, but there hasn’t been quite the fire-and-brimstone sense of opposition evident toward the Obama stimulus a dozen years ago. As the party becomes more focused on the kinds of culture-war battles that Mr. Trump made his signature, and its base shifts away from business elites, it wouldn’t be surprising if we saw the end of an era in which cutting government spending was its animating idea. This would imply a U.S. government that aims to keep flooding the economy with cash no matter who wins the next few elections. 17. The post-pandemic era could start with a bang The last year has been terrible on nearly every level. But it’s easy to see the potential for the economy to burst out of the starting gate like an Olympic sprinter. That could have consequences beyond 2021. A rapid start to the post-pandemic economy could create a virtuous cycle in which consumers spend; companies hire and invest to fulfill that demand; and workers wind up having more money in their pockets to consume even more. Americans have saved an extra $1.8 trillion during the pandemic, reflecting government help and lower spending. That is money that people can spend in the months ahead, or it could give them a comfort level that they have adequate savings and can spend more of their earnings. Things are also primed for a boom time in the executive suite. C.E.O. confidence is at a 17-year high, and near-record stock market valuations imply that companies have access to very cheap capital. There is no reason corporate America can’t hire, invest and expand to take advantage of the post-pandemic surge in activity. And on a psychological level, doesn’t everybody desperately want to return to feeling a sense of joy, of exuberance? That is an emotion that could prove the most powerful economic force of them all. Economics may be a dismal science, and those of us who write about it are consigned to see what is broken in the world.

The empty shelves at a Target store in Dallas last June highlight how companies of all types were unprepared for a crisis.Credit...Nitashia Johnson for The New York Times By Peter S. Goodman and Niraj Chokshi June 1, 2021 Leer en español In the story of how the modern world was constructed, Toyota stands out as the mastermind of a monumental advance in industrial efficiency. The Japanese automaker pioneered so-called Just In Time manufacturing, in which parts are delivered to factories right as they are required, minimizing the need to stockpile them. Over the last half-century, this approach has captivated global business in industries far beyond autos. From fashion to food processing to pharmaceuticals, companies have embraced Just In Time to stay nimble, allowing them to adapt to changing market demands, while cutting costs. But the tumultuous events of the past year have challenged the merits of paring inventories, while reinvigorating concerns that some industries have gone too far, leaving them vulnerable to disruption. As the pandemic has hampered factory operations and sown chaos in global shipping, many economies around the world have been bedeviled by shortages of a vast range of goods — from electronics to lumber to clothing. In a time of extraordinary upheaval in the global economy, Just In Time is running late. “It’s sort of like supply chain run amok,” said Willy C. Shih, an international trade expert at Harvard Business School. “In a race to get to the lowest cost, I have concentrated my risk. We are at the logical conclusion of all that.” The most prominent manifestation of too much reliance on Just In Time is found in the very industry that invented it: Automakers have been crippled by a shortage of computer chips — vital car components produced mostly in Asia. Without enough chips on hand, auto factories from India to the United States to Brazil have been forced to halt assembly lines. But the breadth and persistence of the shortages reveal the extent to which the Just In Time idea has come to dominate commercial life. This helps explain why Nike and other apparel brands struggle to stock retail outlets with their wares. It’s one of the reasons construction companies are having trouble purchasing paints and sealants. It was a principal contributor to the tragic shortages of personal protective equipment early in the pandemic, which left frontline medical workers without adequate gear. Image Shortages of personal protective equipment early in the pandemic left frontline medical workers without adequate gear.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times Just In Time has amounted to no less than a revolution in the business world. By keeping inventories thin, major retailers have been able to use more of their space to display a wider array of goods. Just In Time has enabled manufacturers to customize their wares. And lean production has significantly cut costs while allowing companies to pivot quickly to new products. These virtues have added value to companies, spurred innovation and promoted trade, ensuring that Just In Time will retain its force long after the current crisis abates. The approach has also enriched shareholders by generating savings that companies have distributed in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Still, the shortages raise questions about whether some companies have been too aggressive in harvesting savings by slashing inventory, leaving them unprepared for whatever trouble inevitably emerges. “It’s the investments that they don’t make,” said William Lazonick, an economist at the University of Massachusetts. Intel, the American chip-maker, has outlined plans to spend $20 billion to erect new plants in Arizona. But that is less than the $26 billion that Intel spent on share buybacks in 2018 and 2019 — money the company could have used to expand capacity, Mr. Lazonick said. Some experts assume that the crisis will change the way companies operate, prompting some to stockpile more inventory and forge relationships with extra suppliers as a hedge against problems. But others are dubious, assuming that — same as after past crises — the pursuit of cost savings will again trump other considerations. Chaos on the Seas The shortages in the world economy stem from factors beyond lean inventories. The spread of Covid-19 has sidelined port workers and truck drivers, impeding the unloading and distribution of goods made at factories in Asia and arriving by ship to North America and Europe. Image The pandemic has slowed sawmill operations, causing a shortage of lumber that has hampered home building in the United States.Credit...Octavio Jones for The New York Times The pandemic has slowed sawmill operations, causing a shortage of lumber that has stymied home building in the United States. Winter storms that shut down petrochemical plants in the Gulf of Mexico have left key products in short supply. Andrew Romano, who runs sales at a chemical company outside Philadelphia, has grown accustomed to telling customers they must wait on their orders. “You have a confluence of forces,” he said. “It just ripples through the supply.” Steep increases in demand made pet food scarce and Grape-Nuts cereal all but disappear from American store shelves for a time. Some companies were especially exposed to such forces given that they were already running lean as the crisis began. And many businesses have combined a dedication to Just In Time with a reliance on suppliers in low-wage countries like China and India, making any disruption to global shipping an immediate problem. That has amplified the damage when something goes awry — as when an enormous vessel lodged in the Suez Canal this year, closing the primary channel linking Europe and Asia. “People adopted that kind of lean mentality, and then they applied it to supply chains with the assumption that they would have low-cost and reliable shipping,” said Mr. Shih, the Harvard Business School trade expert. “Then, you have some shocks to the system.” An Idea That Went ‘Way Too Far’ Image Toyota relied on suppliers near its base in Japan, making the company less susceptible to events far away.Credit...Toshifumi Kitamura/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Just In Time was itself an adaptation to turmoil, as Japan mobilized to recover from the devastation of World War II. Densely populated and lacking in natural resources, Japan sought to conserve land and limit waste. Toyota eschewed warehousing, while choreographing production with suppliers to ensure that parts arrived when needed. By the 1980s, companies around the globe were emulating Toyota’s production system. Management experts promoted Just In Time as a way to boost profits. Today in Business Latest Updates Updated June 3, 2021, 8:18 p.m. ET Bill Ackman’s SPAC is close to a deal valuing Universal Music at $40 billion. Treasury official sentenced to 6 months in prison for leaking bank reports of Trump associates. Biden issues an order banning U.S. investment in firms that aid surveillance and repression. “Companies that run successful lean programs not only save money in warehouse operations but enjoy more flexibility,” declared a 2010 McKinsey presentation for the pharmaceutical industry. It promised savings of up to 50 percent on warehousing if clients embraced its “lean and mean” approach to supply chains. Such claims have panned out. Still, one of the authors of that presentation, Knut Alicke, a McKinsey partner based in Germany, now says the corporate world exceeded prudence. “We went way too far,” Mr. Alicke said in an interview. “The way that inventory is evaluated will change after the crisis.” Many companies acted as if manufacturing and shipping were devoid of mishaps, Mr. Alicke added, while failing to account for trouble in their business plans. “There’s no kind of disruption risk term in there,” he said. Experts say that omission represents a logical response from management to the incentives at play. Investors reward companies that produce growth in their return on assets. Limiting goods in warehouses improves that ratio. “To the extent you can keep reducing inventory, your books look good,” said ManMohan S. Sodhi, a supply chain expert at the City, University of London Business School. From 1981 to 2000, American companies reduced their inventories by an average of 2 percent a year, according to one study. These savings helped finance another shareholder-enriching trend — the growth of share buybacks. In the decade leading up to the pandemic, American companies spent more than $6 trillion to buy their own shares, roughly tripling their purchases, according to a study by the Bank for International Settlements. Companies in Japan, Britain, France, Canada and China increased their buybacks fourfold, though their purchases were a fraction of their American counterparts. Repurchasing stock reduces the number of shares in circulation, lifting their value. But the benefits for investors and executives, whose pay packages include hefty allocations of stock, have come at the expense of whatever the company might have otherwise done with its money — investing to expand capacity, or stockpiling parts. These costs became conspicuous during the first wave of the pandemic, when major economies including the United States discovered that they lacked capacity to quickly make ventilators. “When you need a ventilator, you need a ventilator,” Mr. Sodhi said. “You can’t say, ‘Well, my stock price is high.’” When the pandemic began, car manufacturers slashed orders for chips on the expectation that demand for cars would plunge. By the time they realized that demand was reviving, it was too late: Ramping up production of computer chips requires months. “The impact to production will get worse before it gets better,” said Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford Motor, which has long embraced lean manufacturing, speaking to stock analysts on April 28. The company said the shortages would probably derail half of its production through June. The automaker least affected by the shortage is Toyota. From the inception of Just In Time, Toyota relied on suppliers clustered close to its base in Japan, making the company less susceptible to events far away. ‘It All Cascades’ Image Shipping companies have played a crucial role in Just In Time manufacturing by effectively shrinking the expanse of oceans.

The empty shelves at a Target store in Dallas last June highlight how companies of all types were unprepared for a crisis.Credit...Nitashia Johnson for The New York Times By Peter S. Goodman and Niraj Chokshi June 1, 2021 Leer en español In the story of how the modern world was constructed, Toyota stands out as the mastermind of a monumental advance in industrial efficiency. The Japanese automaker pioneered so-called Just In Time manufacturing, in which parts are delivered to factories right as they are required, minimizing the need to stockpile them. Over the last half-century, this approach has captivated global business in industries far beyond autos. From fashion to food processing to pharmaceuticals, companies have embraced Just In Time to stay nimble, allowing them to adapt to changing market demands, while cutting costs. But the tumultuous events of the past year have challenged the merits of paring inventories, while reinvigorating concerns that some industries have gone too far, leaving them vulnerable to disruption. As the pandemic has hampered factory operations and sown chaos in global shipping, many economies around the world have been bedeviled by shortages of a vast range of goods — from electronics to lumber to clothing. In a time of extraordinary upheaval in the global economy, Just In Time is running late. “It’s sort of like supply chain run amok,” said Willy C. Shih, an international trade expert at Harvard Business School. “In a race to get to the lowest cost, I have concentrated my risk. We are at the logical conclusion of all that.” The most prominent manifestation of too much reliance on Just In Time is found in the very industry that invented it: Automakers have been crippled by a shortage of computer chips — vital car components produced mostly in Asia. Without enough chips on hand, auto factories from India to the United States to Brazil have been forced to halt assembly lines. But the breadth and persistence of the shortages reveal the extent to which the Just In Time idea has come to dominate commercial life. This helps explain why Nike and other apparel brands struggle to stock retail outlets with their wares. It’s one of the reasons construction companies are having trouble purchasing paints and sealants. It was a principal contributor to the tragic shortages of personal protective equipment early in the pandemic, which left frontline medical workers without adequate gear. Image Shortages of personal protective equipment early in the pandemic left frontline medical workers without adequate gear.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times Just In Time has amounted to no less than a revolution in the business world. By keeping inventories thin, major retailers have been able to use more of their space to display a wider array of goods. Just In Time has enabled manufacturers to customize their wares. And lean production has significantly cut costs while allowing companies to pivot quickly to new products. These virtues have added value to companies, spurred innovation and promoted trade, ensuring that Just In Time will retain its force long after the current crisis abates. The approach has also enriched shareholders by generating savings that companies have distributed in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Still, the shortages raise questions about whether some companies have been too aggressive in harvesting savings by slashing inventory, leaving them unprepared for whatever trouble inevitably emerges. “It’s the investments that they don’t make,” said William Lazonick, an economist at the University of Massachusetts. Intel, the American chip-maker, has outlined plans to spend $20 billion to erect new plants in Arizona. But that is less than the $26 billion that Intel spent on share buybacks in 2018 and 2019 — money the company could have used to expand capacity, Mr. Lazonick said. Some experts assume that the crisis will change the way companies operate, prompting some to stockpile more inventory and forge relationships with extra suppliers as a hedge against problems. But others are dubious, assuming that — same as after past crises — the pursuit of cost savings will again trump other considerations. Chaos on the Seas The shortages in the world economy stem from factors beyond lean inventories. The spread of Covid-19 has sidelined port workers and truck drivers, impeding the unloading and distribution of goods made at factories in Asia and arriving by ship to North America and Europe. Image The pandemic has slowed sawmill operations, causing a shortage of lumber that has hampered home building in the United States.Credit...Octavio Jones for The New York Times The pandemic has slowed sawmill operations, causing a shortage of lumber that has stymied home building in the United States. Winter storms that shut down petrochemical plants in the Gulf of Mexico have left key products in short supply. Andrew Romano, who runs sales at a chemical company outside Philadelphia, has grown accustomed to telling customers they must wait on their orders. “You have a confluence of forces,” he said. “It just ripples through the supply.” Steep increases in demand made pet food scarce and Grape-Nuts cereal all but disappear from American store shelves for a time. Some companies were especially exposed to such forces given that they were already running lean as the crisis began. And many businesses have combined a dedication to Just In Time with a reliance on suppliers in low-wage countries like China and India, making any disruption to global shipping an immediate problem. That has amplified the damage when something goes awry — as when an enormous vessel lodged in the Suez Canal this year, closing the primary channel linking Europe and Asia. “People adopted that kind of lean mentality, and then they applied it to supply chains with the assumption that they would have low-cost and reliable shipping,” said Mr. Shih, the Harvard Business School trade expert. “Then, you have some shocks to the system.” An Idea That Went ‘Way Too Far’ Image Toyota relied on suppliers near its base in Japan, making the company less susceptible to events far away.Credit...Toshifumi Kitamura/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Just In Time was itself an adaptation to turmoil, as Japan mobilized to recover from the devastation of World War II. Densely populated and lacking in natural resources, Japan sought to conserve land and limit waste. Toyota eschewed warehousing, while choreographing production with suppliers to ensure that parts arrived when needed. By the 1980s, companies around the globe were emulating Toyota’s production system. Management experts promoted Just In Time as a way to boost profits. Daily Business Briefing Latest Updates Updated June 11, 2021, 1:46 p.m. ET The value of Rupert Murdoch’s racy The Sun newspaper is written down to nothing. A federal judge halts the Biden administration’s minority farmer relief program. Today in On Tech: Are Big Tech’s wealthiest worth their pay? “Companies that run successful lean programs not only save money in warehouse operations but enjoy more flexibility,” declared a 2010 McKinsey presentation for the pharmaceutical industry. It promised savings of up to 50 percent on warehousing if clients embraced its “lean and mean” approach to supply chains. Such claims have panned out. Still, one of the authors of that presentation, Knut Alicke, a McKinsey partner based in Germany, now says the corporate world exceeded prudence. “We went way too far,” Mr. Alicke said in an interview. “The way that inventory is evaluated will change after the crisis.” Many companies acted as if manufacturing and shipping were devoid of mishaps, Mr. Alicke added, while failing to account for trouble in their business plans. “There’s no kind of disruption risk term in there,” he said. Experts say that omission represents a logical response from management to the incentives at play. Investors reward companies that produce growth in their return on assets. Limiting goods in warehouses improves that ratio. “To the extent you can keep reducing inventory, your books look good,” said ManMohan S. Sodhi, a supply chain expert at the City, University of London Business School. From 1981 to 2000, American companies reduced their inventories by an average of 2 percent a year, according to one study. These savings helped finance another shareholder-enriching trend — the growth of share buybacks. In the decade leading up to the pandemic, American companies spent more than $6 trillion to buy their own shares, roughly tripling their purchases, according to a study by the Bank for International Settlements. Companies in Japan, Britain, France, Canada and China increased their buybacks fourfold, though their purchases were a fraction of their American counterparts. Repurchasing stock reduces the number of shares in circulation, lifting their value. But the benefits for investors and executives, whose pay packages include hefty allocations of stock, have come at the expense of whatever the company might have otherwise done with its money — investing to expand capacity, or stockpiling parts. These costs became conspicuous during the first wave of the pandemic, when major economies including the United States discovered that they lacked capacity to quickly make ventilators. “When you need a ventilator, you need a ventilator,” Mr. Sodhi said. “You can’t say, ‘Well, my stock price is high.’” When the pandemic began, car manufacturers slashed orders for chips on the expectation that demand for cars would plunge. By the time they realized that demand was reviving, it was too late: Ramping up production of computer chips requires months. “The impact to production will get worse before it gets better,” said Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford Motor, which has long embraced lean manufacturing, speaking to stock analysts on April 28.

The Consumer Price Index surged 5 percent in May from a year earlier, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had expected an increase of 4.7 percent. Prices rose 0.6 percent from April to May, and an index that excludes volatile food and energy costs rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier, the briskest pace since 1992. Prices are rising for many goods and services, as varied as airfares and used cars, the result of bottlenecks and strong consumer demand as a pandemic-stricken economy comes roaring back. Government officials and many economists have said much of the jump is likely to fade with time as the economy gets past a reopening bounce and supply catches up. The annual number in particular is getting a boost from what’s called a base effect: The year-ago figure was depressed by shutdowns, so the current readings look large by comparison. One reason inflation rose sharply. May 2021: +5% +5% +4 Percent change in Consumer Price Index from a year prior +3 +2 +1 2019 2020 2021 Some of May’s jump can be explained through what’s known as base effects — prices fell significantly last spring, so the increase now from the year prior is larger. 270 2021 Consumer Price Index 265 260 2020 255 Jan April July Oct.

Notes: C.P.I. of 100 is equal to prices in 1984. Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze But the big monthly figure for May, on the heels of a sharp rise in April, showed that prices have been moving up quickly for more than just technical reasons. The critical question is whether those stronger-than-expected price pressures are a transient trend tied to reopening or something more persistent. “We are at peak heat, this is the moment,” said Julia Coronado, founder of the research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. “We know we’ll get a fade — the question is, how big is the fade?” Ms. Coronado, like many economists, expects inflation to settle down and remain in line with the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent average goal over time. The Fed uses a different index, the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure, to define its target. That gauge is closely linked to C.P.I., though it tends to run slightly below it. The stakes are high on both Wall Street and Main Street. Inflation can erode purchasing power if wages do not keep up. A short-lived burst would be unlikely to cause lasting damage, but an entrenched one could force the Fed to reduce its support for the economy, potentially tanking stocks and risking a fresh recession. Washington’s next policy steps could also hinge on what happens with prices. Republicans are using the numbers to argue that big spending on pandemic relief, along with additional spending on infrastructure, which the administration proposes paying for largely with tax increases, would be imprudent. “It ought to have a sobering effect on anyone who digs in their heels that somehow the country needs more stimulus, or that the country needs more free money,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota and a member of the Senate Banking Committee. The government’s debt pile is already at record levels. The Treasury Department said on Thursday that the federal budget deficit hit $2.1 trillion for the first eight months of the fiscal year in May, the highest ever. That is a 10 percent increase from 2020 and reflects the government response to the pandemic, including stimulus payments and funds for state and local governments. The monthly deficit in May was $132 billion, a decline from a year ago, when tax payments were delayed until July. The White House does not see inflation as a reason to temper its infrastructure and jobs proposals, a senior administration official said, since that spending would roll out over several years and involve longer-term investments. The administration also took solace in the market reaction to the new price data, which it saw as a sign that the pickup is widely expected to be temporary. Investors were unmoved by the inflation data, suggesting they had already penciled in higher prices and did not think the data fundamentally changed the outlook for Fed policy. Yields on 10-year government bonds, which have been particularly sensitive to concerns about inflation, fell by Thursday afternoon, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent, crossing above its May 7 closing high. Outside of the base effect, the recent pop in consumer prices has been driven by two big trends. The economy is reopening from a global pandemic shutdown for the first time, and critical materials are in short supply as manufacturers try to ramp up production. Many households are also flush with cash to spend after multiple stimulus checks and months in lockdown, and that has been goosing consumer demand. Where’s the inflation? Price increases are coming heavily from categories affected by supply disruptions and the pandemic reopening, including cars and airfares. Percent Change, May 2021 from May 2020 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index By The New York Times The 29.7 percent annual increase in used car prices reported for May is among the more striking examples of how bottlenecks are causing inflation. Demand for cars — used and new — is outpacing supply in part because of a global shortage of semiconductors that has hobbled vehicle production. That chip shortage, which arose from factory shutdowns during the pandemic and one-off problems like a drought in Taiwan, could take time to resolve but it should prove to be temporary. In a sign that companies are finding a way to adjust to the global shortage, General Motors said earlier in June that it would start to increase shipments of pickup trucks and other vehicles to dealers. Airfares demonstrate another trend. Few people were flying for vacation or work last spring, depressing prices. As people return to the skies, the data shows a big surge in prices, even though that particular price index has yet to fully return to its pre-pandemic level. Such effects should fade with time. Economists are instead parsing the data for signs that price increases will prove longer lasting. For example, two measures of housing costs that make up a big share of the inflation reading, but which move slowly, shot higher in May. Economists pay close attention to those metrics — rent and what’s known as owners’ equivalent rent, which tries to capture how much owned houses would cost as rentals. “We are getting an earlier rebound than what we were envisioning — that’s significant,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, also a founding partner at MacroPolicy Perspectives, speaking on the same call as Ms. Coronado. But Ms. Rosner said she also expected the pressures on other goods and services prices to fade. Yoram Weinreich, a founder of a furniture company called Simpli Home that sells dining room tables and T.V. consoles both direct-to-consumer and via online retailers like Wayfair and Amazon, has already raised prices this year. He said he was planning a “mid-double-digit” increase — around 15 percent for some products — in the coming months. The pandemic era has been a wild ride for Mr. Weinreich. He had expected demand to slump last spring but it surged instead, as consumers stuck at home and with stimulus funds in their pockets bought furniture. Factories in Asia and Brazil couldn’t keep pace with the burst of new orders. Now, international shipping costs have skyrocketed, and it’s hard to get containers at any price. “It was getting used to the new demand, then it was factory capacity, and now you can’t get containers,” he said, explaining that he expects prices to remain elevated at least through the Chinese New Year in February, thanks to the shipping cycle. “Consumers are going to have some massive sticker shock in the short term, and how much will it come down?” Mr. Weinrich isn’t alone in raising prices. Chipotle said this week that it would pass on higher labor costs, charging slightly more for its menu offerings. The consumer goods company Procter & Gamble has said it will charge more for its products, as varied as tampons and diapers. The debate will now center on whether price increases will slow to a more normal rate over time, as the Biden administration and top Fed officials predict, or if they will remain too high, as Republicans warn. Image Some households are flush with cash to spend after multiple stimulus checks and months in lockdown, lifting consumer demand.Credit...Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times “This is the largest year-over-year increase in prices since the Great Recession, and massive stimulus spending is a contributing factor,” Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, wrote on Twitter. “Proposals for further federal spending, coupled with job-killing tax hikes, are not the remedy for economic recovery.” The White House has been focused on alleviating bottlenecks where it can, reviewing the supply chain for semiconductors and critical minerals used in all sorts of products. But controlling inflation falls largely to the Fed. The central bank’s June meeting is next week, which will give the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, another opportunity to address how he and his colleagues plan to achieve their two key goals — stable prices and full employment — in the tricky post-pandemic economic environment. “The Fed has never said how big a reopening spike it expected, but we’re guessing that policymakers have been surprised by the past two months’ numbers,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note following the release. The immediate policy question facing the Fed is when, and how quickly, it will begin to slow its $120 billion in monthly government-backed bond purchases. That bond-buying, which started at the height of the pandemic, is meant to keep borrowing of all kinds cheap and stoke demand. Because it bolsters stock prices, markets are very attuned to when central bankers will taper it. Mr. Powell and his colleagues have repeatedly said that they need to see “substantial” further progress toward maximum employment and stable inflation that averages 2 percent over time before they pull back from that policy. A “number” of officials at the Fed’s last meeting said that it might soon be time to begin discussing a policy change, and the inflation figures are another data point likely to ramp up pressure to get moving sooner rather than later. “I don’t think there’s anything in this data that is going to threaten the Fed’s baseline view that this will prove transitory,” said Krishna Guha of the research firm Evercore ISI. Still, the Fed is likely to start a discussion on tapering. “You don’t want to bet the farm that if we go through another three, four, five of these serial upside surprises” that expectations for inflation will remain tempered, he said. It’s “an insurance policy.” The Fed could also lift interest rates, which are near zero, to help to control inflation if higher prices prove especially troublesome. Both cutting bond buying and lifting rates would make paying interest on the government’s big debt pile more expensive — and while that is unlikely to be a direct consideration for the Fed, which is politically independent, it could influence how much the government is willing to spend and borrow in the future.

It also said it would push back its official return-to-office date to mid-October from September, joining a host of other companies whose plans have been scrambled in recent days by the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced the news in a note to employees, which was reviewed by The New York Times. “Getting vaccinated is one of the most important ways to keep ourselves and our communities healthy in the months ahead,” Mr. Pichai wrote. He added that the vaccine mandate would apply to U.S. office locations “in the coming weeks” and to other regions “in the coming months.” Google has more than 144,000 employees globally. A Google spokeswoman said the company did not have any current vaccination rates to share, though Mr. Pichai wrote that it was “encouraging to see very high vaccination rates” among employees in places where vaccines were widely available. Mr. Pichai also said in the note that Google’s voluntary work-from-home policy was being extended through Oct. 18. Previously, employees had been planning to return in September, though no specific date had been set. “We recognize that many Googlers are seeing spikes in their communities caused by the Delta variant and are concerned about returning to the office,” Mr. Pichai wrote. “This extension will allow us time to ramp back into work while providing flexibility for those who need it.” The decision followed a similar announcement from Apple, which said last week that it would push back to October, from September, the date by which employees would need to return to its offices. The companies are among many in tech that are changing their office plans as coronavirus cases spike. Lyft said on Wednesday that it would not require employees to return to the office until February, while Twitter said it would close its newly reopened offices in San Francisco and New York and indefinitely postpone other reopening plans. Some Google employees have been returning to work in the office on a voluntary basis. In California, as the Delta variant of the coronavirus has surged, workers began donning masks in Google offices again. Silicon Valley tech companies like Google led the push to remote work in the beginning of the pandemic, but Google has not fully pivoted away from office work, and it has said it expects most employees to eventually return to in-person work at least three days a week. The company said in March that it would spend $1 billion on California developments this year, including two office complexes in Mountain View. It is also building a 7.3 million-square-foot office space in San Jose.

Google’s campus in Mountain View, Calif. The company will delay its return to office and mandate vaccines for its workers.Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times By Kellen Browning, Erin Woo and Kate Conger July 28, 2021 Google said Wednesday that it would require employees who returned to the company’s offices to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. It also said it would push back its official return-to-office date to mid-October from September, joining a host of other companies whose plans have been scrambled in recent days by the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced the news in a note to employees, which was reviewed by The New York Times. “Getting vaccinated is one of the most important ways to keep ourselves and our communities healthy in the months ahead,” Mr. Pichai wrote. He added that the vaccine mandate would apply to U.S. office locations “in the coming weeks” and to other regions “in the coming months.” Google has more than 144,000 employees globally. A Google spokeswoman said the company did not have any current vaccination rates to share, though Mr. Pichai wrote that it was “encouraging to see very high vaccination rates” among employees in places where vaccines were widely available. Mr. Pichai also said in the note that Google’s voluntary work-from-home policy was being extended through Oct. 18. Previously, employees had been planning to return in September, though no specific date had been set. “We recognize that many Googlers are seeing spikes in their communities caused by the Delta variant and are concerned about returning to the office,” Mr. Pichai wrote. “This extension will allow us time to ramp back into work while providing flexibility for those who need it.” The decision followed a similar announcement from Apple, which said last week that it would push back to October, from September, the date by which employees would need to return to its offices. The companies are among many in tech that are changing their office plans as coronavirus cases spike.
