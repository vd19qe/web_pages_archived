All the closures are in effect until April 5. In a news release on Sunday, March 15, the town said the decision was made to “ensure continued containment of the virus.” To show how things are changing daily, chief administrative officer Tom Kuchyt said the only facilities the town was keeping open were town hall and the Gibson (operations) Centre, but the situation is evolving. At the same time, he said her was ""99 per cent sure"" things would change. And Tuesday morning, things did, in fact, change as it was announced town hall and the Gibson Centre would be added to the list of closures. Next Monday's council meeting, however, will still be held.. “We have a council meeting on March 23 that will go ahead, but we will be reducing the schedule and staff where possible,” Kuchyt mentioned. That meeting will also be closed to the public, and a public meeting regarding a development on Townline Road in Black Creek, which was scheduled to take place at that time, has been postponed. “We are going to make it go as quickly as possible,” Kuchyt said, adding that councillors will deal mainly with the passage of bylaws. In addition, all meetings for committees of council have been cancelled.
