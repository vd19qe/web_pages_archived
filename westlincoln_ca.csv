As of now Township facilities will be closed until July 2, 2020. This will be adjusted as we learn more from the Province. However, we will begin a phased approach commencing with the Smithville Public Library. West Lincoln Public Library Service Update The Government of Ontario released a detailed list of Stage 1 openings on May 14, which indicated that public library services may resume for pickup/delivery as early as May 19, 2020. In order to ensure our staff and patrons’ health and safety, West Lincoln Public Library is taking a phased approach to reopening the library. This will allow for the full development of procedures to make sure that the library is a safe place for everyone. In preparation for the resumption of library borrowing, we are asking any patrons who have kept items out during closure to return them to the library at their earliest convenience. Drop boxes are open 24/7 at all branches. In the meantime, we are preparing to offer curbside pickup; details for this service will be provided in the coming days. Mayor Dave Bylsma stated: “Little by little township staff are making the necessary adjustments to allow our community to return to normal. This work is ongoing and requires thorough vetting and consideration from a public health and safety perspective. There are considerable challenges to overcome but a brighter spring is emerging because of the patience and diligence of our residents.” Media Contact Dave Bylsma Mayor Township of West Lincoln 905.957.3346 Subscribe Contact Us Subscribe to this page Township of West Lincoln 318 Canborough St. Box 400 Smithville, ON LOR 2A0 Phone: 905-957-3346 Fax: 905-957-3219 TTY: 905-957-0680 Subscribe To Council Newsletter Follow Us © 2020 West Lincoln AccessibilityFreedom of InformationPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseSitemapWebsite FeedbackContact Us Designed by eSolutionsGroup I'd Like To...

On May 14, the Province announced the opening of certain outdoor amenities such as golf courses and marinas which may open on Saturday, May 16, pending they can abide by strict social distancing rules imposed by the Province. Regional and municipal governments continue ongoing work to map Niagara’s path forward as the Province prepares to enter its first phase of recovery on Tuesday, May 19 including lifting the closures of several non-essential business categories like retail operations (with entrances onto the street) and all construction projects. In addition to easing certain restrictions some previously closed amenities are opening for use as of Tuesday May 19th as well. For West Lincoln these amenities include: Tennis courts Boat launches Although the Province has lifted certain amenities to be open, we ask for the public to remain patient as staff prepare these facilities for operation over the coming days. Specifically, residents will be able to use parks and outdoor sports fields for more than walk-through uses but everyone should be reminded that use of their facilities will include some limitations. Residents are reminded that they must continue to abide by restrictions limiting groups to no more than five people and maintaining a two-metre physical separation. Passive activities in parks and outdoor sports fields will now be allowed, this includes: Bringing a chair or blanket to relax in parks Kicking a ball, playing catch, flying a kite and other such activities with members of your own households Individual activities such as yoga or exercising, provided they are not in a group or class Anyone taking advantage of these spaces should be sure to follow the best practices to limit the spread of COVID-19 as outlined by Niagara Region Public Health. These include frequent washing / sanitization of hands, physical separation, avoiding touching of shared surfaces and staying home if displaying symptoms or having been in contact with cases of the virus. Organized sports are still restricted on municipal fields, given their necessity for gathering of groups. At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, benches, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. Bylaw enforcement will continue to enforce gatherings larger than five people, dogs off-leash, and anyone using closed park amenities. Mayor Dave Bylsma stated, “We're pleased to be able to offer our township's interpretation of the province's phasing in of their recovery plan. With the nicer weather coming it'll be a welcome relief. I'm so glad that our diligence and cooperation are paying off”.

As of now Township facilities will be closed until July 2, 2020. This will be adjusted as we learn more from the Province. However, we will begin a phased approach commencing with the Smithville Public Library. West Lincoln Public Library Service Update The Government of Ontario released a detailed list of Stage 1 openings on May 14, which indicated that public library services may resume for pickup/delivery as early as May 19, 2020. In order to ensure our staff and patrons’ health and safety, West Lincoln Public Library is taking a phased approach to reopening the library. This will allow for the full development of procedures to make sure that the library is a safe place for everyone. In preparation for the resumption of library borrowing, we are asking any patrons who have kept items out during closure to return them to the library at their earliest convenience. Drop boxes are open 24/7 at all branches. In the meantime, we are preparing to offer curbside pickup; details for this service will be provided in the coming days. Mayor Dave Bylsma stated: “Little by little township staff are making the necessary adjustments to allow our community to return to normal. This work is ongoing and requires thorough vetting and consideration from a public health and safety perspective. There are considerable challenges to overcome but a brighter spring is emerging because of the patience and diligence of our residents.” Media Contact Dave Bylsma Mayor Township of West Lincoln 905.957.3346 Subscribe Contact Us Subscribe to this page Township of West Lincoln 318 Canborough St. Box 400 Smithville, ON LOR 2A0 Phone: 905-957-3346 Fax: 905-957-3219 TTY: 905-957-0680 Subscribe To Council Newsletter Follow Us © 2020 West Lincoln A to Z ServicesAccessibilityFreedom of InformationPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseSitemapWebsite FeedbackContact Us Designed by eSolutionsGroup I'd Like To...

On May 14, the Province announced the opening of certain outdoor amenities such as golf courses and marinas which may open on Saturday, May 16, pending they can abide by strict social distancing rules imposed by the Province. Regional and municipal governments continue ongoing work to map Niagara’s path forward as the Province prepares to enter its first phase of recovery on Tuesday, May 19 including lifting the closures of several non-essential business categories like retail operations (with entrances onto the street) and all construction projects. In addition to easing certain restrictions some previously closed amenities are opening for use as of Tuesday May 19th as well. For West Lincoln these amenities include: Tennis courts Boat launches Although the Province has lifted certain amenities to be open, we ask for the public to remain patient as staff prepare these facilities for operation over the coming days. Specifically, residents will be able to use parks and outdoor sports fields for more than walk-through uses but everyone should be reminded that use of their facilities will include some limitations. Residents are reminded that they must continue to abide by restrictions limiting groups to no more than five people and maintaining a two-metre physical separation. Passive activities in parks and outdoor sports fields will now be allowed, this includes: Bringing a chair or blanket to relax in parks Kicking a ball, playing catch, flying a kite and other such activities with members of your own households Individual activities such as yoga or exercising, provided they are not in a group or class Anyone taking advantage of these spaces should be sure to follow the best practices to limit the spread of COVID-19 as outlined by Niagara Region Public Health. These include frequent washing / sanitization of hands, physical separation, avoiding touching of shared surfaces and staying home if displaying symptoms or having been in contact with cases of the virus. Organized sports are still restricted on municipal fields, given their necessity for gathering of groups. At this time park and outdoor amenities such as playground equipment, benches, and washrooms remain closed to limit the spread of COVID-19 on shared surfaces. Bylaw enforcement will continue to enforce gatherings larger than five people, dogs off-leash, and anyone using closed park amenities. Mayor Dave Bylsma stated, “We're pleased to be able to offer our township's interpretation of the province's phasing in of their recovery plan. With the nicer weather coming it'll be a welcome relief. I'm so glad that our diligence and cooperation are paying off”.

To participate, each municipality has to pass a motion of support. The Township of West Lincoln unanimously passed a resolution of support to sign the declaration. Diversity, equity and inclusion matter to all and this is a step in working supportively together to tackle racism and discrimination and promote human rights and diversity. HIGHRIVER DEVELOPMENTS - WITHDRAWAL Township staff were notified that rezoning application 1601-020-19 made by Highriver Developments for a 4 storey apartment building on 255 Station Street has been withdrawn by the applicant and this specific proposal will no longer be pursued. SIGN BY-LAW Council adopted a Sign By-law to regulate the erection of signs on any and all properties within the boundaries of the Township and also prohibits signage which constitutes a danger or hazard to the public, any business signs on residential lands, any sign located obstructing the view of any pedestrian or motor vehicle driver so as to cause an unsafe condition and abandoned signs. The by-law outlines specific setbacks for the installation of various signs, provides for permit fees for signage as well as set fines and penalties for not following the sign by-law. TEMPORARY BULK WATER ACCOUNTS Council approved an amendment to By-law 2004-42, a by-law to regulate the Supply of Water and to Provide for the imposition and Collection of Water Rates, by adding in a definition for “Bulk Water Customer” and amending Schedule C, to include a new non-refundable, taxable $40.00 administration fee upon activation of temporary bulk water accounts, which will help offset staff time and resource costs incurred by the Township. PLANNING FEES Council approved an amendment to By-law 2011-28 (Appendix A - Schedule of Fees) which came into effect July 1, 2020 in order to split up the Subdivision, Condominium and Development Agreement fee to better align the fee amount to staff time and resources. TEMPORARY PATIOS Council approved a blanket resolution of support for such licensed establishments to open and operate patios temporarily and includes extending patios for the duration of 2020 subject to the following; That the Fire Chief and Chief Building Official are satisfied that appropriate operational criteria are satisfied, and; That the patio is designed such that all physical distancing measures will be complied with along with any public health guidelines as ordered, and; That proper site design techniques are used in order to ensure proper separation of the licensed areas from the parking areas and other non-compatible uses. NAMING OF REGIONAL ROAD 24 AS VICTORIA AVENUE Council passed a by-law to officially name Regional Road 24 as Victoria Avenue in order to correct an issue that was brought to staffs attention by Regional Survey and Mapping Staff that had discovered 29 property addresses in their system where the street name is Vineland Townline Road and not Victoria Avenue.

To participate, each municipality has to pass a motion of support. The Township of West Lincoln unanimously passed a resolution of support to sign the declaration. Diversity, equity and inclusion matter to all and this is a step in working supportively together to tackle racism and discrimination and promote human rights and diversity. HIGHRIVER DEVELOPMENTS - WITHDRAWAL Township staff were notified that rezoning application 1601-020-19 made by Highriver Developments for a 4 storey apartment building on 255 Station Street has been withdrawn by the applicant and this specific proposal will no longer be pursued. SIGN BY-LAW Council adopted a Sign By-law to regulate the erection of signs on any and all properties within the boundaries of the Township and also prohibits signage which constitutes a danger or hazard to the public, any business signs on residential lands, any sign located obstructing the view of any pedestrian or motor vehicle driver so as to cause an unsafe condition and abandoned signs. The by-law outlines specific setbacks for the installation of various signs, provides for permit fees for signage as well as set fines and penalties for not following the sign by-law. TEMPORARY BULK WATER ACCOUNTS Council approved an amendment to By-law 2004-42, a by-law to regulate the Supply of Water and to Provide for the imposition and Collection of Water Rates, by adding in a definition for “Bulk Water Customer” and amending Schedule C, to include a new non-refundable, taxable $40.00 administration fee upon activation of temporary bulk water accounts, which will help offset staff time and resource costs incurred by the Township. PLANNING FEES Council approved an amendment to By-law 2011-28 (Appendix A - Schedule of Fees) which came into effect July 1, 2020 in order to split up the Subdivision, Condominium and Development Agreement fee to better align the fee amount to staff time and resources. TEMPORARY PATIOS Council approved a blanket resolution of support for such licensed establishments to open and operate patios temporarily and includes extending patios for the duration of 2020 subject to the following; That the Fire Chief and Chief Building Official are satisfied that appropriate operational criteria are satisfied, and; That the patio is designed such that all physical distancing measures will be complied with along with any public health guidelines as ordered, and; That proper site design techniques are used in order to ensure proper separation of the licensed areas from the parking areas and other non-compatible uses.

TEMPORARY USE BY-LAW FOR PATIOS Restaurants have been permitted to open up and operate patios, licensed or unlicensed for the remainder of 2020, provided that proper physical distancing requirements are met. In order to do so, patios are encroaching into areas that might otherwise be allocated for parking purposes. Ontario regulation 345/20 allows for temporary use bylaws to be passed alleviating zoning regulations that may not be complied with if patios expand into parking areas. Council adopted a by-law to implement a temporary zoning exception for outdoor patios when approved by the CBO and Fire Chief, for the remainder of 2020. PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE SITE ALTERATION BY-LAW 2016-41 There are some sections of the current version of By-law 2016-41, as amended, that need to be changed, corrected, or strengthened. Staff presented a report with a number of proposed changes to address these issues. A by-law will be presented at a future meeting. ROAD ALLOWANCE OPENING AND DEVELOPMENT A resolution was adopted by Council to direct Township staff to draft Official Plan Policies and a procedural guideline on Road Openings and extensions and present them to Planning Committee or Council at a future date, prior to a public meeting being held. All new road extensions will be put on hold until such time that Policies and Procedures have been put in place. PARKING, DRIVEWAY, BOULEVARDS & CULVERT BY-LAW REVIEW Township Staff are intending to create a clear process for members of the public to install a new driveway entrance, or alter an existing driveway or boulevard, while protecting Township assets. Township Staff also wish to explore alternative winter parking regulations allowing greater flexibility for on-street parking. Council authorized Staff to hold a public meeting at a future Planning/Building/Environment Committee Meeting or Council Meeting, and send out proper notification to all residents through local newspapers and other means so that broad consultation can occur. COLLEGE STREET SECONDARY PLAN & ST. MARTIN SECONDARY PLAN Council authorized staff to seek agency input and comment prior to holding a formal public meeting and to commence the public consultation (open house and formal public meeting) process prior to preparing a recommendation report for Committee and Council consideration. SANITARY AND STORM SEWER CONDITION ASSESSMENT PROJECT Council passed a by-law to authorize an agreement with Civica Infrastructure Inc. for the Sanitary and Storm Sewer Condition Assessment project in the amount of $267,362.85 (plus HST). 2020 HOT MIX SPOT REPAIR Council passed a by-law to enter into an agreement with Circle P Paving Inc. for hot mix spot repair for various locations in the amount of $178,425.00 (plus HST).

TEMPORARY USE BY-LAW FOR PATIOS Restaurants have been permitted to open up and operate patios, licensed or unlicensed for the remainder of 2020, provided that proper physical distancing requirements are met. In order to do so, patios are encroaching into areas that might otherwise be allocated for parking purposes. Ontario regulation 345/20 allows for temporary use bylaws to be passed alleviating zoning regulations that may not be complied with if patios expand into parking areas. Council adopted a by-law to implement a temporary zoning exception for outdoor patios when approved by the CBO and Fire Chief, for the remainder of 2020. PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE SITE ALTERATION BY-LAW 2016-41 There are some sections of the current version of By-law 2016-41, as amended, that need to be changed, corrected, or strengthened. Staff presented a report with a number of proposed changes to address these issues. A by-law will be presented at a future meeting. ROAD ALLOWANCE OPENING AND DEVELOPMENT A resolution was adopted by Council to direct Township staff to draft Official Plan Policies and a procedural guideline on Road Openings and extensions and present them to Planning Committee or Council at a future date, prior to a public meeting being held. All new road extensions will be put on hold until such time that Policies and Procedures have been put in place. PARKING, DRIVEWAY, BOULEVARDS & CULVERT BY-LAW REVIEW Township Staff are intending to create a clear process for members of the public to install a new driveway entrance, or alter an existing driveway or boulevard, while protecting Township assets. Township Staff also wish to explore alternative winter parking regulations allowing greater flexibility for on-street parking. Council authorized Staff to hold a public meeting at a future Planning/Building/Environment Committee Meeting or Council Meeting, and send out proper notification to all residents through local newspapers and other means so that broad consultation can occur. COLLEGE STREET SECONDARY PLAN & ST. MARTIN SECONDARY PLAN Council authorized staff to seek agency input and comment prior to holding a formal public meeting and to commence the public consultation (open house and formal public meeting) process prior to preparing a recommendation report for Committee and Council consideration. SANITARY AND STORM SEWER CONDITION ASSESSMENT PROJECT Council passed a by-law to authorize an agreement with Civica Infrastructure Inc. for the Sanitary and Storm Sewer Condition Assessment project in the amount of $267,362.85 (plus HST). 2020 HOT MIX SPOT REPAIR Council passed a by-law to enter into an agreement with Circle P Paving Inc. for hot mix spot repair for various locations in the amount of $178,425.00 (plus HST).

TEMPORARY USE BY-LAW FOR PATIOS Restaurants have been permitted to open up and operate patios, licensed or unlicensed for the remainder of 2020, provided that proper physical distancing requirements are met. In order to do so, patios are encroaching into areas that might otherwise be allocated for parking purposes. Ontario regulation 345/20 allows for temporary use bylaws to be passed alleviating zoning regulations that may not be complied with if patios expand into parking areas. Council adopted a by-law to implement a temporary zoning exception for outdoor patios when approved by the CBO and Fire Chief, for the remainder of 2020. PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE SITE ALTERATION BY-LAW 2016-41 There are some sections of the current version of By-law 2016-41, as amended, that need to be changed, corrected, or strengthened. Staff presented a report with a number of proposed changes to address these issues. A by-law will be presented at a future meeting. ROAD ALLOWANCE OPENING AND DEVELOPMENT A resolution was adopted by Council to direct Township staff to draft Official Plan Policies and a procedural guideline on Road Openings and extensions and present them to Planning Committee or Council at a future date, prior to a public meeting being held. All new road extensions will be put on hold until such time that Policies and Procedures have been put in place. PARKING, DRIVEWAY, BOULEVARDS & CULVERT BY-LAW REVIEW Township Staff are intending to create a clear process for members of the public to install a new driveway entrance, or alter an existing driveway or boulevard, while protecting Township assets. Township Staff also wish to explore alternative winter parking regulations allowing greater flexibility for on-street parking. Council authorized Staff to hold a public meeting at a future Planning/Building/Environment Committee Meeting or Council Meeting, and send out proper notification to all residents through local newspapers and other means so that broad consultation can occur. COLLEGE STREET SECONDARY PLAN & ST. MARTIN SECONDARY PLAN Council authorized staff to seek agency input and comment prior to holding a formal public meeting and to commence the public consultation (open house and formal public meeting) process prior to preparing a recommendation report for Committee and Council consideration.

Mayor Bylsma stated, “Township staff continue to respond quickly to the ever changing circumstances and requirements to deal with COVID-19. Their commitment to keep the community safe and slow the spread has resulted in these current measures. Again we ask for patience and understanding as we head into the winter season.” Media Contact: Dave Bylsma Mayor Township of West Lincoln 905.957.3346 Subscribe Contact Us Subscribe to this page Township of West Lincoln 318 Canborough St. Box 400 Smithville, ON L0R 2A0 Phone: 905-957-3346 Fax: 905-957-3219 TTY: 905-957-0680 Subscribe To Council Newsletter Follow Us © 2020 West Lincoln A to Z ServicesAccessibilityFreedom of InformationPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseSitemapWebsite FeedbackContact Us Designed by eSolutionsGroup I'd Like To...

TEMPORARY USE BY-LAW FOR PATIOS Restaurants have been permitted to open up and operate patios, licensed or unlicensed for the remainder of 2020, provided that proper physical distancing requirements are met. In order to do so, patios are encroaching into areas that might otherwise be allocated for parking purposes. Ontario regulation 345/20 allows for temporary use bylaws to be passed alleviating zoning regulations that may not be complied with if patios expand into parking areas. Council adopted a by-law to implement a temporary zoning exception for outdoor patios when approved by the CBO and Fire Chief, for the remainder of 2020. PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE SITE ALTERATION BY-LAW 2016-41 There are some sections of the current version of By-law 2016-41, as amended, that need to be changed, corrected, or strengthened. Staff presented a report with a number of proposed changes to address these issues. A by-law will be presented at a future meeting. ROAD ALLOWANCE OPENING AND DEVELOPMENT A resolution was adopted by Council to direct Township staff to draft Official Plan Policies and a procedural guideline on Road Openings and extensions and present them to Planning Committee or Council at a future date, prior to a public meeting being held. All new road extensions will be put on hold until such time that Policies and Procedures have been put in place. PARKING, DRIVEWAY, BOULEVARDS & CULVERT BY-LAW REVIEW Township Staff are intending to create a clear process for members of the public to install a new driveway entrance, or alter an existing driveway or boulevard, while protecting Township assets. Township Staff also wish to explore alternative winter parking regulations allowing greater flexibility for on-street parking. Council authorized Staff to hold a public meeting at a future Planning/Building/Environment Committee Meeting or Council Meeting, and send out proper notification to all residents through local newspapers and other means so that broad consultation can occur. COLLEGE STREET SECONDARY PLAN & ST. MARTIN SECONDARY PLAN Council authorized staff to seek agency input and comment prior to holding a formal public meeting and to commence the public consultation (open house and formal public meeting) process prior to preparing a recommendation report for Committee and Council consideration. SANITARY AND STORM SEWER CONDITION ASSESSMENT PROJECT Council passed a by-law to authorize an agreement with Civica Infrastructure Inc. for the Sanitary and Storm Sewer Condition Assessment project in the amount of $267,362.85 (plus HST). 2020 HOT MIX SPOT REPAIR Council passed a by-law to enter into an agreement with Circle P Paving Inc. for hot mix spot repair for various locations in the amount of $178,425.00 (plus HST).

Recreation and LeisureAnnual Community Events Decrease text size Default text size Increase text size Print this page Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Email Menu West Lincoln Santa Claus Parade The West Lincoln Christmas Parade Committee meets regularly to coordinate the annual Christmas Parade. Join us for a fun holiday celebration! West Lincoln Santa Claus Parade The first Santa Claus Parade held in West Lincoln occurred in 1990 and has been a highly anticipated yearly town event since. Over the years, the amount of floats and parade attendees grew exponentially, and route variations were taken in stride to accept the growth of this small town parade. Dave Willis, the long-time Committee Chair, passed away suddenly in late 2019, but the remaining Committee members persevered to put on a beautiful Parade, in his honor, that same year. In 2020, a brand new group of Parade Committee volunteers stepped forward to take a hold of the reins and keep this Parade on the same esteemed course it has been on for the past several decades. One of the Committee’s first major decisions was to rename the parade the “West Lincoln Santa Claus Parade” for a more overall inclusive tone. Unfortunately, this choice was then followed up by the extremely hard decision to cancel the 2020 West Lincoln Santa Claus Parade due to the COVID-19 pandemic. West Lincoln Sparkles 2020 Trying to keep the spirit of Christmas alive and to spread some much needed holiday cheer, the West Lincoln Santa Claus Parade Committee has tirelessly worked on putting together West Lincoln Sparkles 2020, a Township-wide holiday lighting and décor contest. Social Media and Contact Information For more information on the West Lincoln Santa Claus Parade, the West Lincoln Sparkles 2020 contest, or the 2020 Parade Sponsors, please visit the new website at https://www.wlparade.com/ .

CHANGES TO CONSERVATION AUTHORITIES ACT AND CONSERVATION AUTHORITIES' ROLE IN LAND USE PLANNING Township Council approved a resolution with respect to Bill 229, Protect, Support and Recover from COVID 19 Act - Schedule 6 - Conservation Authorities Act. This legislation introduced a number of changes and new sections that could remove and/or significantly hinder the conservation authorities' role in regulating development, and engaging in review and appeal of municipal planning applications including but not limited to watersheds, the appointment of municipal representatives on Conservation Authority Boards and the planning approvals process which may potentially result in delays in the development approval process. The resolution requests the Province to work with conservation authorities to address their concerns by repealing and/or amending changes to the Conservation Authorities Act and the Planning Act, delay enactment of clauses affecting municipal concerns, provide a longer transition period up to December 2022 for non-mandatory programs to enable coordination of CA-municipal budget processes, respect the current conservation authority/municipal relationships and embrace the long-standing partnership with the conservation authorities and provide them with the tools and financial resources needed to effectively implement their watershed management role. NIAGARA PENINSULA CONSERVATION AUTHORITY – UPDATE OF 2020 INITIATIVES Brenda Johnson, Chair of the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority (NPCA) provided an update on the initiatives that have been taken by the NPCA in 2020 and noted that with COVID-19 affecting our lives, it has become very clear the importance of our greenspaces and parks are for all ages. Ms. Johnson further noted that due to the pandemic, many of the NPCA's revenue generated events have been either cancelled or geared down to almost nothing including the Balls Falls Thanksgiving event which was held virtually this year. Ms. Johnson noted that countless hours have been dedicated to reviewing the Auditor General's report, with nearly 70% of the report being completed and the NPCA Board was also addressing Bill 229 and its impact on the NPCA and its municipal partnerships. Ms. Johnson noted that in spite of Bill 229, the NPCA will be moving forward with their Strategic Plan which may require a few of the objectives to change in order to accommodate for Bill 229. Ms. Johnson noted that the NPCA looked forward to continuing good communication and relationships with their municipal partners.

Mayor Bylsma advised that this motion was supported at Regional Council. FARM 911: THE EMILY PROJECT Mr. Rob Cosby, Director of the Niagara Federation of Agriculture provided a presentation regarding the Farm 911 project. Mr. Cosby stated that the project has become a province wide initiative over the past couple of years. Mr. Cosby stated that the Farm 911 signs are black and yellow, as opposed to the residential green and white numbered signs, which indicates that there was no residence or building on the property. Mr. Cosby noted that the Farm 911 signs would be a field marker, however, would still fall in line and in sequence with the other numbered signs on the road and would therefore be recorded in the 911 system to give a definite address of the property. Janice Janiec, Member Service Rep, stated that the Ontario Federation of Agriculture has resources to assist staff with the implementation of the Farm 911, should assistance be required. This matter was referred to staff for report and recommendation at a future meeting. DISCONTINUATION OF WATER SHUT OFF PRACTICES Council adopted a by-law to amend By-law 2004-42 to discontinue the practice of disconnecting water services for non-payment of overdue water accounts. Instead any unpaid water account balances will be transferred to the property’s tax account and a ‘transfer to taxes’ $20 taxable administration fee will be charged to offset staff time and resource costs associated with this task. REQUEST FOR ONE-TIME CONTRIBUTION FOR HOSPICE EXPANSION Ms. Carol Nagy, Hospice Niagara reviewed a PowerPoint Presentation, requesting a one-time contribution to expand hospices in the Niagara Region, which will include: (1) 20 new hospice residence beds being built in Niagara, (2) preserve the hospice beds in West Lincoln, which currently has 6 beds, (3) bring 50 to 60 new health care jobs to Niagara, many being professionals, (4) will bring $14M of capital investment in Niagara’s health care system which will translate into $3.1M spending in Niagara and (5) will help more than 10,000 people across the Region each year. Ms. Nagy reiterated that there was a real “end of life crisis” in Niagara and if nothing is done to expand hospice capacity then end of life care will need to be done in hospitals, which will result in our health care costs increasing and would not provide the type of care that families want for their loved ones at end of life. Ms. Nagy asked West Lincoln Council to match what other municipalities in the Niagara Region have done by contributing funding to Niagara Hospice. Council received the correspondence for information. NEW FIRE STATION #2 – ARCHITECTURAL & DESIGN SERVICES Council adopted a by-law to enter into an agreement with Raimondo & Associates Architects Inc. for Architectural Services for Design and Contract Administration Services for the new Fire Station #2 in the amount of $182,721.00 taxes included. NIAGARA TRANSIT GOVERNANCE STUDY PRESENTATION & REQUEST TO ENDORSE RESOLUTION IN PRINCIPLE Matt Robinson, Niagara Region, Director GO Implementation introduced himself as well as the other Niagara Region staff members (Scott Fraser, Heather Talbot) and consultants (Mariam Ali, Eric Gillespie) Mr. Robinson provided an informative presentation reviewing the next steps in the transition towards a consolidated transit system in Niagara. Mr. Robertson noted that he and his team will be attending all thirteen municipalities across Niagara to obtain feedback and incorporate what they hear into their final report, which will be brought back to Council for a final vote. Mr. Robertson stated that based on the revisions, the triple majority process will commence formally in the Summer of 2021 and if the process and timelines progress as planned you should see in September 2022, a new single transit commission in place. A motion was presented for Council’s consideration, which Mr. Robertson advised was non-binding at this time and was intended to get agreement for support of a consolidated transit system in Niagara. Council had many questions and concerns with respect to the proposal and in the end could not support the resolution. Council has until February 28, 2021 to submit any further questions, suggestions or concerns on the proposal. NAMING OF REGIONAL ROAD 9 AS YORK ROAD – 911 PERS NAMING PROCESS Council passed a By-law to name Regional Road 9 as York Road, which needed to be addressed for the purposes of 911 PERS compliance. This will help eliminate confusion for emergency response personnel and ensure a faster response time. WEST LINCOLN SANTA CLAUS PARADE COMMITTEE Ms. Nicole Scime, Chair of the West Lincoln Santa Claus Parade Committee presented a PowerPoint Presentation noting that in light of COVID-19 and the need to cancel this year's Parade, the Committee ran a very successful community Christmas Lighting and Décor contest (""West Lincoln Sparkles""). Ms. Scime advised that a number of businesses sponsored the event as well there were many entries submitted between the two divisions (lighting & décor) among four categories, being Town - Urban Smithville, Rural - West Lincoln, Commercial and Not-for-Profit. The Parade Committee hoped to be able to organize both the parade and the lighting contest again next year. The Committee was investigating the possibility of having an evening parade which would be focused on lights as well as having the traditional bands and possibly other type of performers. Many of the Members of Council thanked Ms. Scime for her informative presentation and for her and the other parade committee members volunteering their time as well as their hard work and dedication by offering a community event throughout the Township, in spite of a pandemic happening. SUMMER AND DECEMBER MEETING SCHEDULE Council approved the meeting schedule for July and December, 2021, as follows: Monday, July 26, 2021 Public Meetings under the Planning Act – 6:30 p.m., Council – Immediately following the Public Meetings under the Planning Act., the Council meeting to commence at 7 pm (with Planning, Administration and Public Works items included on Council Agenda) Monday, December 6, 2021 Public Meetings under the Planning Act – 6:30 p.m., All Committees (including separate agendas for Administration, Public Works and Planning Committee Meetings) - immediately following the Public Meetings Monday, December 13, 2021 Council Meeting – 7:00 p.m. ROAD POLICIES FOR UNOPENED OR UNMAINTAINED ROADS Council adopted Official Plan Amendment No. 58, Road Policies for unopened or unmaintained roads due to an increased amount of requests from the public to extend or open road allowances within the Township to gain frontage to existing lots for the purpose of constructing new buildings. This document will be a guiding tool that can be followed when these type of inquiries are made to maintain consistency. WEST LINCOLN TOWNSHIP HEALTH & SAFETY POLICY BY-LAW Council reconfirmed the Municipal Health and Safety Policy Statement for the Corporation of the Township of West Lincoln which exercise is undertaken annually to be in compliance with the Occupational Health & Safety Act.

The Provincial Government has stated starting Tuesday, February 16, 2021 the Region of Niagara will remain in the Grey Lockdown for fourteen days, which will require residents to continue with enhanced public health and workplace safety measures that have been in effect since January 14, 2021. People should only leave home for groceries, medical appointments, exercise or essential work, and all businesses must ensure that any employee who can work from home, does work from home. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 5 people. The Township Administrative building and other facilities will remain closed to the public. As a result of this announcement, additional township office staff will continue to work remotely; however, residents and businesses should not experience any disruptions when accessing Town services such as planning applications and building permits. Everyone is encouraged to call 905-957-3346 or check www.westlincoln.ca Committee and Council will continue to meet virtually (as previously scheduled) to provide policy direction to staff regarding Township operations and initiatives. The next Committee meeting is February 16, 2021, via ZOOM. To view future Committee and Council meeting information, please visit the Council and Committee Meetings page on the Township’s website. The West Lincoln Public Library is open with modified hours at Caistorville and Wellandport branches, and regular hours at Smithville branch, for curbside pickup only. Appointments for curbside must be scheduled in advance. Please visit the W est Lincoln Public Library website for hours, the online catalogue and e- resources, as well as information on how to schedule a curbside pickup appointment and we request that you continue to return any materials via the drop boxes at each branch. Help prevent the spread of COVID-19: Practice physical distancing by avoiding close interaction with others (stay more than 2 metres or 6 feet apart). Wash your hands often with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Wear a face covering in public (indoors and outdoors) in accordance with Niagara’s Face Covering By-law, following the provincial order. Limit trips into the community to specific purposes that are important to you since extra time outside of the home adds to crowds and makes it more difficult for others to physically distance. Stay home if you are sick. Although COVID-19 is often very mild, minor symptoms should not be ignored. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve. Many people are being impacted by the lockdown and there are resources available to our residents. We encourage those who are impacted to visit the Niagara Region - Health and W ellness page for more important information. Report a COVID-19 concern To report a concern about gatherings or businesses not following COVID-19 guidelines, contact Municipal Law Enforcement: 905-957-3346. For By-law enforcement after hours (after 4:30 p.m. and weekends), please call Niagara Region dispatch line at 905-984-3690 or 1-877-552-5579. Another easy way to connect is the use the “Report a Concern” on the Township website. Mayor Dave Bylsma Stated: It is no small disappointment to come out of a provincial lockdown into a regional grey zone.

The Township of West Lincoln has observed that demand for new housing and related commercial development is increasing within the urban boundary of Smithville. The East Smithville lands are one of the last remaining undeveloped Greenfield areas within the boundary. An Open House will be scheduled late February. The consultant has prepared 3 concepts for this area. All of these options will be presented to the public for consultation. PLANNING FEES AND COMMITTEE OF ADJUSTMENT BY-LAW REVISION A by-law was adopted by Council to amend the planning fees by-law to impose an across the board fee in the amount of $1200.00, where development (that first required a rezoning, official plan amendment, plan of subdivision, site plan or site plan amendment) has commenced before a planning application is submitted. This fee will also be imposed where a minor variance is required and works have begun prior to a planning application being submitted. ATV REGULATION CHANGES - PROVINCE OF ONTARIO Previously Provincial legislation required that municipalities had to enact a by-law to permit off road vehicles to operate on municipal highways. As of January 1, 2021 off road vehicles are now permitted by default on municipal highways, unless the municipality has an existing by-law that restricts, prohibits or regulates their use or if the municipality creates a new by-law to prohibit, restrict or regulate the use of some or all off road vehicles. Staff was directed to report back with a draft by-law prior to holding a public meeting. DEVELOP & SUPPLY DISC GOLF AMENITIES Correspondence was received from Marlene Bergsma, Director of Communications & Advancement of the Smithville Christian High School advising of a proposal in 2021 for the school and its students to work with the Township to develop a nine-hole disc golf course at the Wellandport Community Centre and to supply nine student-built disc golf targets (or cages) constructed according to professional-level specifications. This was supported by Council in principle and Ms. Bergsma will be attending the March Administration Committee meeting for further discussions while staff was directed to investigate the matter further including any grant opportunities that may be available. NEW WEST NIAGARA SECONDARY SCHOOL – FUNDRAISING PROPOSAL Mr. Matt Miller, Principal, Grimsby Secondary School advised that he will be the principal of the New West Niagara Secondary School which will accommodates public secondary students from the three West Niagara municipalities. Mr. Miller presented an overview of the amenities and programs of the new school. Mr. Miller introduced Ms. Meredith Short, English/Drama teacher to address the launch of the fundraising campaign to raise $2.6 million to construct a 750-seat indoor theatre. Council supported the initiative in principle but did not commit to making a monetary contribution at this time.

The Township of West Lincoln will be lowering the flags to half mast, from Thursday, March 11th to Sunday, March 14th to honour the people who have died of COVID-19 over the past year. West Lincoln will join neighbouring municipalities in a region-wide acknowledgement of the losses. These dates coincide with the one-year anniversary of the first COVID-19 case in the local community. The first death in the region was reported on March 24, 2020 and to date has claimed the lives of 369 residents in the region. Our thoughts are with their families, friends and caregivers. As we reflect on the year, we thank the West Lincoln Community for their patience and support as we navigated the unchartered territory of responding to a global pandemic. We know that everyone’s experiences through this pandemic were very personal. There have been those who have struggled with feelings of the unknown, isolation, depression and stress. COVID-19 has deeply affected our local economy with job losses and business interruption and even closures. To this end, our township has demonstrated its capacity as a kind and patient community. As we continue the protocols of physical distancing and mask-wearing, we are now pivoting to the provincial vaccination plan and with four vaccines approved, the implementation plan to roll out the process will begin mid-March. MAYOR BYLSMA STATED: “As we approach this one year mark there are several mixed feelings that congeal together. There is a profound loss for those that have passed. There is also an acknowledgement that our community has fared better than many. We can attest to challenges that were overcome and creativity that enabled us to come together as neighbours. The generosity and mutual wellbeing rose higher than the anxiety and fear. Thank you to all frontline hero’s and dedicated citizens that led us through”.

AMENDMENT TO THE BUILDING BY-LAW - FEE INCREASE Council gave authority to hold a Public Meeting to present a fee increase of up to fifteen percent (15%) in building fees to reflect an increase of service and operation costs of the Building Department since 2016.
