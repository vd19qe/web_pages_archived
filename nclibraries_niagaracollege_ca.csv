Transferring your test results to another college Applicants who have completed the HOAE at Niagara College will have their results submitted directly to OCAS.

Accommodated Testing (LOA) The Test Centre at Niagara College provides testing accommodations, including extended time to write tests/exams, specialized assistive technology, alternative testing strategies, etc. In order to provide test accommodations for a student with a disability, the Disability Services must provide the Test Centre with a Letter of Accommodation. This letter includes all pertinent information for the Test Centre staff to ensure that appropriate accommodations with respect to tests are provided. The Letter of Accommodation specifically outlines any or all of the following test accommodations: Additional time to write tests/exams Adaptive computer and software required to complete tests/exams Specific requirements with respect to testing environment Requirements for scribes, interpreter services and/or other supports Do you need accommodations for a pre-admission test? Disability Services can assist you with preparing for a Pre-Admission test as part of applying to a Niagara College program. Visit Accessibility Services Test Centre Procedures In order to ensure that proper testing accommodations are provided, and to maintain academic integrity, please review the following testing procedures. A minimum of one week prior to each test, students should login into Clockwork and schedule their test in the Test Centre through Clockwork. Any student that has difficulty with booking a test on Clockwork is invited to go to the Test Centre in person to discuss the issue with Test Centre staff and assistance will be provided. Students who do not follow this protocol may find that accommodation cannot be provided. Students are responsible for identifying assistive technology needs such as Dragon, Kurzwell, Scribe, and Reader, etc. The assistive technology is not guaranteed if the assistive technology is not identified at the time of booking. When a student books his/her appointment via Clockwork the course instructor is immediately notified via email that the test has been scheduled and the course instructor will liaise directly with the Test Centre to provide all testing materials and test instructions that will be shared with the test writer at the scheduled time of the test. Any questions or concerns should be directed to the Test Centre and Test Centre staff will be happy to assist you. On the day of the test, students will proceed to the Test Centre to write their test. Students will be asked to show a photo ID (a student card is fine). Once complete, the course instructor will pick up your test from the Test Centre. Any inquiries regarding the marking of tests completed in the Test Centre should be directed to the specific course instructor for the course being taken. NEW TEST CENTRE SERVICE: The NOTL and Welland Test Centres are happy to provide a new service for students with a Letter of Accommodation. With Niagara College switching to an online model of learning, students that are required to take online tests that would require a scribe now have the option to book a virtual scribe through the Test Centre.

Accommodated Testing (LOA) The Test Centre at Niagara College provides testing accommodations, including extended time to write tests/exams, specialized assistive technology, alternative testing strategies, etc. In order to provide test accommodations for a student with a disability, the Disability Services must provide the Test Centre with a Letter of Accommodation. This letter includes all pertinent information for the Test Centre staff to ensure that appropriate accommodations with respect to tests are provided. The Letter of Accommodation specifically outlines any or all of the following test accommodations: Additional time to write tests/exams Adaptive computer and software required to complete tests/exams Specific requirements with respect to testing environment Requirements for scribes, interpreter services and/or other supports Do you need accommodations for a pre-admission test? Disability Services can assist you with preparing for a Pre-Admission test as part of applying to a Niagara College program. Visit Accessibility Services Test Centre Procedures In order to ensure that proper testing accommodations are provided, and to maintain academic integrity, please review the following testing procedures. A minimum of one week prior to each test, students should login into Clockwork and schedule their test in the Test Centre through Clockwork. Any student that has difficulty with booking a test on Clockwork is invited to go to the Test Centre in person to discuss the issue with Test Centre staff and assistance will be provided. Students who do not follow this protocol may find that accommodation cannot be provided. Students are responsible for identifying assistive technology needs such as Dragon, Kurzwell, Scribe, and Reader, etc. The assistive technology is not guaranteed if the assistive technology is not identified at the time of booking. When a student books his/her appointment via Clockwork the course instructor is immediately notified via email that the test has been scheduled and the course instructor will liaise directly with the Test Centre to provide all testing materials and test instructions that will be shared with the test writer at the scheduled time of the test. Any questions or concerns should be directed to the Test Centre and Test Centre staff will be happy to assist you. On the day of the test, students will proceed to the Test Centre to write their test. Students will be asked to show a photo ID (a student card is fine). Once complete, the course instructor will pick up your test from the Test Centre. Any inquiries regarding the marking of tests completed in the Test Centre should be directed to the specific course instructor for the course being taken.

Students are responsible for identifying assistive technology needs such as Dragon, Kurzwell, Scribe, and Reader, etc. The assistive technology is not guaranteed if the assistive technology is not identified at the time of booking.

If you live more than three hours from a Niagara College campus, your situation will be assessed on an individual basis and you may be permitted to take the HOAE at a qualified location in your area. If you wish to request off-site testing, please contact us at hoae@niagaracollege.ca. Accessibility Services for Students If you are an applicant with a disability and require accommodation to complete this exam, you are required to complete a “Pre-Admission Testing and Accommodation Request Form”, which will be at the end of the online form when you register for your HOAE exam. Please be aware that the type of accommodation(s) received will be based on the recommendation of Niagara College’s Disability Services Office. For more information and questions about pre-admission testing, please contact Accessibility Services. Transferring your test results to another college Applicants who have completed the HOAE at Niagara College will have their results submitted directly to OCAS. Your results will then be automatically transferred by OCAS to all other Ontario institutions that you have applied to that require this examination. Accommodated Testing (LOA) The Test Centre at Niagara College provides testing accommodations, including extended time to write tests/exams, specialized assistive technology, alternative testing strategies, etc. In order to provide test accommodations for a student with a disability, the Disability Services must provide the Test Centre with a Letter of Accommodation. This letter includes all pertinent information for the Test Centre staff to ensure that appropriate accommodations with respect to tests are provided. The Letter of Accommodation specifically outlines any or all of the following test accommodations: Additional time to write tests/exams Adaptive computer and software required to complete tests/exams Specific requirements with respect to testing environment Requirements for scribes, interpreter services and/or other supports Do you need accommodations for a pre-admission test? Disability Services can assist you with preparing for a Pre-Admission test as part of applying to a Niagara College program. Visit Accessibility Services Test Centre Procedures In order to ensure that proper testing accommodations are provided, and to maintain academic integrity, please review the following testing procedures. A minimum of one week prior to each test, students should login into Clockwork and schedule their test in the Test Centre through Clockwork. Any student that has difficulty with booking a test on Clockwork is invited to go to the Test Centre in person to discuss the issue with Test Centre staff and assistance will be provided. Students who do not follow this protocol may find that accommodation cannot be provided. Students are responsible for identifying assistive technology needs such as Dragon, Kurzwell, Scribe, and Reader, etc. The assistive technology is not guaranteed if the assistive technology is not identified at the time of booking. When a student books his/her appointment via Clockwork the course instructor is immediately notified via email that the test has been scheduled and the course instructor will liaise directly with the Test Centre to provide all testing materials and test instructions that will be shared with the test writer at the scheduled time of the test. Any questions or concerns should be directed to the Test Centre and Test Centre staff will be happy to assist you. On the day of the test, students will proceed to the Test Centre to write their test. Students will be asked to show a photo ID (a student card is fine). Once complete, the course instructor will pick up your test from the Test Centre. Any inquiries regarding the marking of tests completed in the Test Centre should be directed to the specific course instructor for the course being taken. NEW TEST CENTRE SERVICE: The NOTL and Welland Test Centres are happy to provide a new service for students with a Letter of Accommodation. With Niagara College switching to an online model of learning, students that are required to take online tests that would require a scribe now have the option to book a virtual scribe through the Test Centre. For this service students will require the following: Computer or laptop with camera and microphone High speed internet connection MS Teams installed on their device Please contact the NOTL Test Centre (nltesting@niagaracollege.ca) or the Welland Test Centre (wctesting@niagaracollege.ca) a minimum of 7 days prior to your classes scheduled test date to book a scribe for your test. Make Up / Missed Tests Students who miss tests due to extenuating circumstances such as (but not limited to) illness, emergency, or inclement weather may write tests in the Test Centre if approved and verified by the professor. Due to space and staffing limitations, we cannot guarantee that requests for supplemental/make up tests or exams will be facilitated. How do I book a make up or missed test? Get approval from your Professor that you may book an appointment to write a missed or make up test. Note that your Professor will be contacted. Make sure that you will be able to make it to an appointment during our normal business hours. All test writing requests need to be received by the Test Centre one week in advance of the desired test writing date. We want to ensure that we have proper staffing and the space for you to take your test. We may offer to schedule your make up/missed test/exam at another date or time when space is available in the Test Centre. Visit the Test Centre in person to book an appointment for your test.
