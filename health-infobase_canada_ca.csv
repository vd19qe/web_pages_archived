Daily* change in the number of cases, deaths and tests performed, by province or territory, as of Location New cases New deaths Tests performed * The new cases, deaths and tests reflect the difference between a province or territory's current report and their last report. Some provinces and territories do not update daily. N/A means that no daily update was provided by the province or territory. Variants of Concern (VOC) in Canada All viruses, including COVID-19, change, or mutate, over time. Not all mutations are of concern. However, some changes result in variants of concern (VOC). A VOC has changes that are significant to public health. For example, they might: spread more easily cause more severe illness require different treatments, or not respond the same to current vaccines We update VOC information daily from Sunday to Thursday at 7:00 PM EST, using publicly reported information fro the provinces and territories.

Cumulative number of cases involving variants of concern (VOC) publicly reported, as of 7:00 PM EST Location B.1.1.7 variant B.1.351 variant P.1 variant Note: The table reports publicly available information from the provinces and territories. In case of discrepancies, the provincial or territorial data should be considered current and correct. Detailed case information The tables and figures below reflect detailed case information provided to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) by health authorities in the provinces and territories. This data is updated every week. It may change as we get more information about cases. Updated: March 26, 2021, 9 am EST Epidemic curve As of March 26, 2021, 9 am EST, PHAC has received detailed case report data on cases. Both exposure and symptom onset date were available for (%) casesFootnote 1. The shaded area on the far right of Figure 2 represents lag time. This is the period of time (1 to 2 weeks) before the latest cases are reported to PHAC. This delay is a result of the time required to seek health care, get tested and receive results. It also takes time for public health authorities to gather information on cases. We update this information as it becomes available. Figure 2.

A VOC has changes that are significant to public health. For example, they might: spread more easily cause more severe illness require different treatments, or not respond the same to current vaccines We update VOC information daily from Sunday to Thursday at 7:00 PM EST, using publicly reported information fro the provinces and territories. Table 2. Cumulative number of cases involving variants of concern (VOC) publicly reported, as of 7:00 PM EST Location B.1.1.7 variant B.1.351 variant P.1 variant Note: The table reports publicly available information from the provinces and territories. In case of discrepancies, the provincial or territorial data should be considered current and correct. Detailed case information The tables and figures below reflect detailed case information provided to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) by health authorities in the provinces and territories. This data is updated every week. It may change as we get more information about cases. Updated: April 9, 2021, 9 am EST Epidemic curve As of April 9, 2021, 9 am EST, PHAC has received detailed case report data on cases. Both exposure and symptom onset date were available for (%) casesFootnote 1. The shaded area on the far right of Figure 2 represents lag time. This is the period of time (1 to 2 weeks) before the latest cases are reported to PHAC. This delay is a result of the time required to seek health care, get tested and receive results. It also takes time for public health authorities to gather information on cases. We update this information as it becomes available. Figure 2.

COVID-19 variants in Canada All viruses, including COVID-19, change over time. These changes are called mutations, and result in variants of the virus. Not all mutations are of concern. Most do not cause more severe illness. However, some mutations result in variants of concern or variants of interest. A variant of concern has mutations that are significant to public health. Before a variant of interest is considered one of concern, scientists and public health professionals must determine if the mutations result in an actual change in the behaviour of the virus. For example, it might: spread more easily cause more severe illness require different treatments, or reduce vaccine effectiveness There are several variants of interest that have mutations similar to variants of concern, but we don’t yet know if they pose a higher risk to public health. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) works with provincial and territorial partners and the Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN) to sequence a percentage of all positive COVID-19 test results. Sequencing reveals the genetic code of the virus, which tells us which variant is involved in a specific case of COVID-19. We report the proportion of COVID-19 variants in Canada every week. We collect evidence to determine if new variants meet the definition for a variant of concern or a variant of interest. Many variants are being tracked across Canada and around the world. Variants of concern now represent a majority of COVID-19 cases in Canada. Four VOCs have been detected in most provinces and territories: B.1.1.7 (Alpha) B.1.351 (Beta) P.1 (Gamma) B.1.617.2 (Delta) New variants will continue to appear. We must remain vigilant and take all available measures to limit spread. Figure 2.

You can see the numbers for each date by hovering over, tabbing to, or long-pressing any of the bars. To see a specific variant or variant grouping, click or press return. Repeat to restore the complete graph. This information is based on whole genome sequencing from surveillance testing in all provinces and territories. In addition to sequencing done by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, data is included from provincial and territorial laboratories. Sequencing takes from 1 to 3 weeks to complete, so the proportions for recent weeks may change as more data are added. Surveillance in each province or territory is organized and prioritized according to local needs and may change from time to time. Because of differences in local sampling and reporting, the percentages illustrate trends rather than precise measurements.

Updated: June 25, 2021, 9 am EST Epidemic curve As of June 25, 2021, 9 am EST, PHAC has received detailed case report data on cases. Both exposure and symptom onset date were available for (%) casesFootnote 1. The shaded area on the far right of Figure 3 represents a period of accumulating data. This is the period of time (1 to 2 weeks) before the latest cases are reported to PHAC. This delay is a result of the time required to seek health care, get tested and receive results. It also takes time for public health authorities to gather information on cases. We update this information as it becomes available. Figure 3.

We have exposure history for 923,042 (89%) cases. The probable exposure setting of these casesFootnote 1 are: any exposure that occurred in Canada: {Spread} ({Percent spread}%), including from contact with a known COVID case: {Spread contact} ({Percent spread}%) from contact with a traveller: {Spread traveller} ({Percent spread}%) from an unknown source: {Spread unknown} ({Percent spread}%) currently unknown (information pending): {Unknown pending} ({Percent unknown pending}%) travelled outside of Canada: {Travelled} ({Percent travelled}%) Cases following vaccination Data extracted on July 28, 2021 for cases from December 14, 2020 up until July 10, 2021. While the COVID-19 vaccines are effective, there is still a small percentage of the population who are vaccinated that will still be infected with COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes it. This means that even with high vaccine effectiveness, a small percentage of the population who are vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get sick and some may be hospitalized or even die as a result of their illness. It is also possible that a person could be infected just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. It typically takes about two weeks for the body to build protection after vaccination, so a person could get sick if the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. Cases reported since the start of the vaccination campaign, as of July 03, 2021 Since the start of the vaccination campaign on December 14, 2020, PHAC received case-level vaccine history data for 75.5% (n=624,980) of COVID-19 cases aged 12 years or older. Of these cases: () were unvaccinated at the time of their episode date () were not yet protected by the vaccine, as their episode date occurred less than 14 days after their first dose () were only partially vaccinated, as their episode date occurred either 14 days or more after their first dose or less than 14 days after their second dose () were fully vaccinated, as their episode date occurred 14 days or more after their second dose Figure 5. Distribution Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to PHAC by vaccination status as of July 10, 2021 Figure 5: Text description Characteristics and severe outcomes associated unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated confirmed cases reported to PHAC, as of July 10, 2021 Status Cases Hospitalizations Deaths July 10, 2021. Of these people: Based on detailed case information reported to PHAC from provinces and territories, cases following vaccination were reported more frequently among females and those aged 60 years and older (Table 2). This may be the result of higher vaccination coverage in Canada among females and those aged 60 years and older due to the prioritization of older age groups and healthcare workers as part of the vaccine rollout. Table 2. Characteristics and severe outcomes associated unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated confirmed cases reported to PHAC, as of July 10, 2021 Source: Detailed case information received by PHAC from provinces and territories, since December 14, 2020 Note: There are currently eleven jurisdictions reporting case-level vaccine history data to PHAC as part of the national COVID-19 dataset. A data cut-off of July 10, 2021 was used to account for any reporting delays associated with vaccine history information. *Cases with missing gender were excluded. Where available, gender data was used; when gender data was unavailable, sex data was used. Reliable data on gender diverse respondents are unavailable due to small counts. Fully vaccinated individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were significantly protected from severe outcomes. Compared to unvaccinated cases, fully vaccinated cases were XX% less likely to be hospitalized and XX% less likely to die as a result of their illness (Table 3). Table 3. Risk of severe outcomes among fully vaccinated cases compared to unvaccinated cases as of July 10, 2021 Table 3. Risk of severe outcomes among fully vaccinated cases compared to unvaccinated cases as of July 10, 2021 Severe Outcome Adjusted* Odds Ratio (95% CI) *Adjusted for 10-year age groups and month of episode date Source: Detailed case information received by PHAC from provinces and territories Note: Due to the nature of the dataset (i.e. confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada), the odds of severe outcomes among cases following vaccination only considers vaccinated individuals that contracted COVID-19. It does not reflect the protection conferred by the vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infection. Definitions Data for this analysis is extracted from the COVID-19 national data set, which contains detailed case-level information received by PHAC from all provinces and territories. Note that a data cut-off of July 10, 2021 was used to account for any reporting delays associated with vaccine history information. There are currently eleven jurisdictions reporting case-level vaccine history data to PHAC as part of the national COVID-19 dataset. PHAC monitors cases following vaccination using the following categories: Unvaccinated cases: include those who were unvaccinated at the time of their episode date. Cases not yet protected from vaccination include those whose episode date occurred less than 14 days after their first dose of the vaccine. Partially vaccinated cases include those whose episode date occurred 14 days or more after their first vaccine dose or less than 14 days after their second dose of the vaccine. Fully vaccinated cases include those whose episode date occurred 14 days or more after their second dose of a two dose vaccine series or those whose episode date occurred 14 days or more after one dose of a one-dose vaccine. Note: When symptom onset date is unavailable or the case is asymptomatic, episode date uses the following dates as a proxy for classification: laboratory specimen collection date, or laboratory testing date.

Weekly variant breakdown Percentage of COVID-19 cases identified through whole genome sequencing, presented by variant and by week of sample collection. Figure 2: Text description Variant Grouping Contributing laboratories: National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) - supplemental sequencing for all provinces and territories Detailed case information The tables and figures below reflect detailed case information provided to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) by health authorities in the provinces and territories. This data is updated every week. It may change as we get more information about cases. Updated: June 25, 2021, 9 am EDT Epidemic curve As of June 25, 2021, 9 am EDT, PHAC has received detailed case report data on cases. Both exposure and symptom onset date were available for (%) casesFootnote 1. The shaded area on the far right of Figure 3 represents a period of accumulating data. This is the period of time (1 to 2 weeks) before the latest cases are reported to PHAC. This delay is a result of the time required to seek health care, get tested and receive results. It also takes time for public health authorities to gather information on cases. We update this information as it becomes available. Figure 3.

We have exposure history for 923,042 (89%) cases. The probable exposure setting of these casesFootnote 1 are: any exposure that occurred in Canada: {Spread} ({Percent spread}%), including from contact with a known COVID case: {Spread contact} ({Percent spread}%) from contact with a traveller: {Spread traveller} ({Percent spread}%) from an unknown source: {Spread unknown} ({Percent spread}%) currently unknown (information pending): {Unknown pending} ({Percent unknown pending}%) travelled outside of Canada: {Travelled} ({Percent travelled}%) Cases following vaccination Data extracted on July 28, 2021 for cases from December 14, 2020 up until July 10, 2021. While the COVID-19 vaccines are effective, there is still a small percentage of the population who are vaccinated that will still be infected with COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes it. This means that even with high vaccine effectiveness, a small percentage of the population who are vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get sick and some may be hospitalized or even die as a result of their illness. It is also possible that a person could be infected just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. It typically takes about two weeks for the body to build protection after vaccination, so a person could get sick if the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. Cases reported since the start of the vaccination campaign, as of July 03, 2021 Since the start of the vaccination campaign on December 14, 2020, PHAC received case-level vaccine history data for 75.5% (n=624,980) of COVID-19 cases aged 12 years or older. Of these cases: () were unvaccinated at the time of their episode date () were not yet protected by the vaccine, as their episode date occurred less than 14 days after their first dose () were only partially vaccinated, as their episode date occurred either 14 days or more after their first dose or less than 14 days after their second dose () were fully vaccinated, as their episode date occurred 14 days or more after their second dose Figure 5. Distribution Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to PHAC by vaccination status as of July 10, 2021 Figure 5: Text description Characteristics and severe outcomes associated unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated confirmed cases reported to PHAC, as of July 10, 2021 Status Cases Hospitalizations Deaths July 10, 2021. Of these people: Based on detailed case information reported to PHAC from provinces and territories, cases following vaccination were reported more frequently among females and those aged 60 years and older (Table 2). This may be the result of higher vaccination coverage in Canada among females and those aged 60 years and older due to the prioritization of older age groups and healthcare workers as part of the vaccine rollout. Table 2. Characteristics and severe outcomes associated unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated confirmed cases reported to PHAC, as of July 10, 2021 Source: Detailed case information received by PHAC from provinces and territories, since December 14, 2020 Note: There are currently eleven jurisdictions reporting case-level vaccine history data to PHAC as part of the national COVID-19 dataset. A data cut-off of July 10, 2021 was used to account for any reporting delays associated with vaccine history information. *Cases with missing gender were excluded. Where available, gender data was used; when gender data was unavailable, sex data was used. Reliable data on gender diverse respondents are unavailable due to small counts. Fully vaccinated individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were significantly protected from severe outcomes. Compared to unvaccinated cases, fully vaccinated cases were XX% less likely to be hospitalized and XX% less likely to die as a result of their illness (Table 3). Table 3. Risk of severe outcomes among fully vaccinated cases compared to unvaccinated cases as of July 10, 2021 Table 3. Risk of severe outcomes among fully vaccinated cases compared to unvaccinated cases as of July 10, 2021 Severe Outcome Adjusted* Odds Ratio (95% CI) *Adjusted for 10-year age groups and month of episode date Source: Detailed case information received by PHAC from provinces and territories Note: Due to the nature of the dataset (i.e. confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada), the odds of severe outcomes among cases following vaccination only considers vaccinated individuals that contracted COVID-19. It does not reflect the protection conferred by the vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infection. Definitions Data for this analysis is extracted from the COVID-19 national data set, which contains detailed case-level information received by PHAC from all provinces and territories. Note that a data cut-off of July 10, 2021 was used to account for any reporting delays associated with vaccine history information. There are currently eleven jurisdictions reporting case-level vaccine history data to PHAC as part of the national COVID-19 dataset. PHAC monitors cases following vaccination using the following categories: Unvaccinated cases: include those who were unvaccinated at the time of their episode date. Cases not yet protected from vaccination include those whose episode date occurred less than 14 days after their first dose of the vaccine. Partially vaccinated cases include those whose episode date occurred 14 days or more after their first vaccine dose or less than 14 days after their second dose of the vaccine. Fully vaccinated cases include those whose episode date occurred 14 days or more after their second dose of a two dose vaccine series or those whose episode date occurred 14 days or more after one dose of a one-dose vaccine. Note: When symptom onset date is unavailable or the case is asymptomatic, episode date uses the following dates as a proxy for classification: laboratory specimen collection date, or laboratory testing date.
