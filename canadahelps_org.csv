We are located in the neighbourhood of Queenston and feel as though our geography plays a central role in defining who we are. It is primarily here that we discover and share that which we have been given. As a group, we are committed to being a contributing member of the Queenston Neighbourhood in St. Catharines, Ontario. Together we aim to develop a sensitivity to the call of love, peace, justice, reconciliation, hope, beauty, and in these, God. Assisted by dialogue and learning, we hope to orientate our lives to the “Good News” found in Christ’s teachings. Donating to Westview Centre4Women?

We’re the largest processor of online security and mutual fund donations in Canada. And, we make it easy to disburse your donation across multiple charities. Find out more about Donating Securities > Donate Securities to this Charity Bringing friends, family or co-workers together to support this charity multiplies your donation.
