""This is scary,"" said Niagara Falls hotelier and restaurant owner Vince Kerrio. Niagara Falls normally sees a busy March break, although the traditional busy tourism season doesn't start until the May 24 long weekend running through Labour Day. But with the illness, sometimes referred to as the coronavirus, spreading worldwide, leading to cancellation or postponement of everything from sporting leagues, festivals, concerts and schooling, local tourism officials don't know what to expect. Related Content Juno Awards cancelled as coronavirus precaution ""In our industry, we're all nervous,"" said Kerrio, who owns a number of properties including the Oakes Hotel and Applebee's Restaurant on Fallsview Boulevard. ""We're in the same position as everybody else, we don't know. In our business, we have a tour-based part of our business that's from Korea, Japanese people, different Asian groups that come to Niagara. And they are not going to come, so we've had cancellations for our spring tours."" Kerrio said he is refocusing marketing efforts closer to home, meaning potential visitors from within 300 to 500 kilometres. ""That's really our bread and butter, but we're going to miss these tour groups because they did fill a void that we don't have (in the spring and fall)."" He said the hope is that Canadians who maybe don't want to take long-haul, out-of-country trips will consider visiting Niagara. ""We're putting protocols in place to try and keep everybody as comfortable as we can. But this thing about not being near crowds — they can come and do their own thing in Niagara Falls, but every time they go any place there will be other people there."""

""With the entire world focused on the No. 1 priority of controlling the spread of COVID-19, predicting business levels is indeed challenging."" Thomson said international visitors are restricted by travel limitations, as are many corporations who have no-travel policies, ""so we will see postponement of travel in these areas."" ""We also know that we have a large population at our doorstep, people who know that Niagara Falls is a destination with so many alternatives for visitor enjoyment. ""Our businesses are fully prepared to meet the tourism needs of those who visit during this time, and when the situation is normalized, most definitely ready to host visitors with proven experiences."" She said the city is ready to continue providing ""superb experiences"" and in the short term, that will be to visitors from within driving range. ""Once the world situation resolves around travel, we can look forward to fulfilling a pent-up demand from all markets. In the meantime, the situation changes daily. ""As a destination with experienced business owners with decades of managing business through changing economic times, weather patterns and unusual issues such as SARS and COVID, we are well-positioned to deliver to full potential."" Dolores Fabiano, executive director for the Niagara Falls Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber received emails from some of its larger corporate members Friday directing their personnel to not participate in large events and some meetings. ""We of course have postponed our state of the city (address by Mayor Jim Diodati) and we are postponing all of our programming for the month of March,"" she said. ""We'll wait until next week to see about our April events. We're just getting ready to send a notice to all of our members, just providing them with some information and some good resources."""

As the region reacts to the COVID-19 pandemic — the first Niagara patient was diagnosed Friday — several upcoming events and performances have been either cancelled or postponed. They come in light of Ontario's chief medical officer Dr. David Williams recommending the ""immediate suspension"" of all gatherings over 250 people. At Meridian Centre arena in St. Catharines, spokeswoman Kay Meilleur says the highly-anticipated March 26 show by Canadian rock band The Glorious Sons will be rescheduled, and she expects other events to follow suit. ""It's looking like things are certainly going to get postponed for the month of March, and we're playing it by ear for April,"" she says. Also cancelled is Cirque du Soleil's nine Meridian Centre performances of ""Crystal"" scheduled for May 27 to 31. This follows Thursday's announcement that the OHL's Niagara IceDogs have suspended play until further notice. The team had two more regular season games scheduled at Meridian Centre. All shows at the FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre (PAC) for the next three weeks have been cancelled, as the City of St. Catharines is closing all its recreational and community facilities until April 5. Affected shows include Les McKeown's Bay City Rollers March 16, The Next Generation Leahy March 22 and Matt Anderson March 25. The facility taped a notice on its front door Friday telling patrons that night's show by Ivan Coyote was cancelled. Also affected by the PAC closures was the Niagara Symphony Orchestra's ""Masterworks 5: Undaunted"" concert Sunday. In a statement, symphony board chairman Brent Harasym suggested ticket holders donate their tickets for a charitable receipt instead of exchange them for a refund."

""The consequences of the COVID-19 crisis on the financial health of charitable arts organizations like the NSO are unknown."" Also at PAC, Carousel Players has postponed performances of its next show, ""Lig & Bittle."" General manager Kate Leathers says it could mean a ""sizable loss"" for the company and will be devastating for cast members. ""This postponement means there are three artists who have lost several weeks of work with only two weeks notice,"" she says. ""Self-employed workers aren't eligible for Employment Insurance and most of the people in the performing arts sector are self-employed."" The Scotiabank Convention Centre in Niagara Falls has several large events scheduled for March and April. Some, like the Greater Niagara Home & Garden Show March 27 to 29, have been cancelled, while others are searching for new dates. ""We've had a significant number of clients looking for accommodation to move and/or reschedule,"" says convention centre president Noel Buckley. ""It's the producers who will make decisions about whether they continue with their show or not. I can't really speak for them."" In Niagara-on-the-Lake, the Shaw Festival is scheduled to start preview performances for its 2020 season April 2. Executive director Tim Jennings says the company will spend the weekend discussing its options before making an announcement Monday. ""This is such a rapidly evolving issue and one that we must get right — for our patrons, for our staff and for our artists."" The effect of COVID-19 will also be felt in movie theatres. Not only are the studios delaying the release of potential blockbusters like ""The Quiet Place II"" – which was scheduled to open March 20 – but theatres in Niagara are limiting the number of seats sold. Both Landmark Cinemas, which operates the Pen Centre Cinemas, and Cineplex Odeon, which operates theatres in Niagara Falls and Welland, say they are reducing capacity in each venue. ""With reduced capacity auditoriums, we are providing our guests with the choice to sit where they feel most comfortable and safe from a social-distancing perspective,"" says Cineplex spokeswoman Sarah Van Lange. The Niagara Fallsview Casino has a combined 38 performances scheduled in its Avalon Theatre and new Entertainment Centre between March 14 and April 30. The Fallsview Casino said live entertainment shows are paused immediately, and rescheduled dates will be announced later."

In April 2019, Niagara Region Chair Jim Bradley delivered his state of the region address to a packed luncheon crowd at Scotiabank Convention Centre in Niagara Falls. He message was: ""We should all believe that Niagara's future is bright and has no limits."" Thursday, Bradley delivered his 2020 state of the region address via video in the quiet of the closed-to-the-public regional headquarters, but again found inspirational themes amid efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. He also didn't sugar-coat present circumstances and delivered the bad news first: Related Content ‘We know it is a challenge to stay in,’ says regional chair Niagara looks in the mirror after province backs off restructuring Challenging year at Niagara Region, Bradley says • A recently completed survey of Niagara businesses shows that one in three report they are at risk of permanent closure due to the pandemic; • Research by Niagara Region Economic Development predicts the pandemic will cost Niagara $16 billion in lost revenues by the end of December if conditions don't improve; • Statistics Canada research found more than 35,000 jobs losses in Niagara in three months, with the actual figure likely much higher; • There are projections that show Niagara's GDP (gross domestic product) could shrink by as much as 40 per cent if conditions do not start to improve immediately. Bradley said areas such as Hamilton, Peel, Halton, Durham and London are all fairing slightly better than Niagara when it comes to unemployment, with our tourism industry all but closed. ""It is this tourism sector that makes us unique and may continue to have unique challenges even as restrictions are lifted,"" Bradley said. ""The amount of infection south of the border makes it difficult to want to see our borders open."""

He lauded front-line health-care professionals and public health staff for working around the clock under high-stress situations to keep us safe. He also said the pandemic has Niagara rethinking what constitutes an essential worker in our community. ""Three months ago, many would not have considered those who work at grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, post offices, newsrooms, landfills, farms and construction sites as absolutely essential to keeping our society functioning,"" he said. ""These individuals, some of whom make a modest wage, continued to do their jobs during a global pandemic simply because it needed to be done."" Bradley said Niagara also has manufacturers who shifted their focus to create products to help combat the virus, residents who rallied around front-line health-care workers, and individuals who give their time and money to nonprofits to help support people most in need. ""Yes, our lives may never be the same as they were before, but that does not mean we are worse off,"" Bradley said. ""In some ways, we have been given the opportunity to rebuild aspects of our economy and our community so that it may better work for everyone. ""I hope as we slowly and safely start to recover and rebuild, we will do so in partnership and collaboration. ""I am confident that we can re-imagine what Niagara could be, and we will write this story together.""
