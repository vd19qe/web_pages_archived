This note provides an outline on characteristics of the retail trade workforce and the predominant jobs in Niagara’s retail sector. Other briefing notes in this series focus on retail trade employers, the link between retail trade in Niagara and the tourism sector, COVID-19 impacts on employment in retail, and insights on what a post-pandemic reality might take for Niagara’s retail trade sector. Demographic Data Much of the data available on characteristics of Niagara’s resident retail workforce come from the 2016 census[1]. According to these data, there were approximately 26,010 Niagara residents reporting employment in the retail trade industry; this was approximately 12.4% of employment among all Niagara residents. Compared to other industry sectors, retail trade sector relied more heavily on a youth workforce. Specifically, 24.2% of people who worked in retail trade were aged 15 to 24; only 14.3% of the total workforce, however, were aged 15 to 24 (see Table 1). Table 1: Workforce by age cohort, Niagara residents, 2016 Census Source: Statistics Canada, 2016 Census. Custom Data Tabulation. Overall, 41.2% of individuals reporting employment in the retail trade sector reported working part-time. Among all other industries, only 23.5% of Niagara’s residents were employed in a part-time capacity (see Figure 1). These data show that, across all age groups, individuals employed in the retail trade industry are more likely to work part-time than their counterparts in other industries. Figure 1: Percentage of each age group working part time, Niagara, 2016 Census Source: Statistics Canada, 2016 Census. Custom Data Tabulation. Educational Attainment Census data also demonstrate that individuals working full time in retail trade report lower levels of post-secondary education completion. Approximately 8.0% of full-time retail trade employees have no certificate, diploma or degree compared to 6.6% of Niagara’s entire full-time labour force. Moreover, 45.2% of full-time retail trade employees have a high school diploma as their highest level of educational attainment compared to 28.9% of Niagara labour force; 46.8% of Niagara’s full-time retail employees have a postsecondary certificate, diploma, or degree, compared to 64.5% of Niagara’s labour force (see Table 2). Table 2: Educational attainment for Niagara’s labour force working full time, 2016 Census Source: Statistics Canada, 2016 Census. Custom Data Tabulation Commuting and wages Niagara residents – regardless of occupation – are unlikely to commute out of the region, with 84.5% of those employed in 2015 commuting within Niagara. Table 3 presents data on the top-five occupations in the retail trade industry by number of jobs in 2019. It also includes median hourly wages from 2019. The median wages for the four most prevalent occupations show that those employees tend to be working either at or near minimum wage, or in a part-time capacity. It also shows the percentage of Niagara residents employed in those occupations who commute to work within Niagara’ according to census data. Notably, all five of the occupations had rates of commuting within Niagara of over 86%. Table 3 Commuter and wage data for retail trade occupations, Niagara region Source: Commuting data – Statistics Canada, 2016 Census. Custom Data Tabulation; Job counts and wage data – EMSI Analyst, 2020.1 dataset, employee Our first report on the general impacts of COVID-19 showed that lower income individuals, youth, and part-time workers are all vulnerable to the negative effects of COVID-19. As the above data show, all three of these demographic groups are heavily represented within the retail trade sector. Further reporting and employer engagement during this project will assess best practices to mitigate these challenges.

Other briefing notes in this series focus on retail trade employers, demographic details of retail trade employees, and the link between retail trade and the tourism sector. This note highlights the state of the labour force within Niagara’s retail trade sector prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. To provide insights on the effects of the pandemic on this sector, we also provide data on employment and job demand in the retail trade sector for the first half of 2020. The data show that measureable job demand within the retail trade sector has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2019 Retail Trade Jobs Niagara housed approximately 27,572 retail trade jobs (12.5% of all local jobs) in the 2019 calendar year; this includes full-time, part-time, and self-employment jobs. The most prominent retail trade subsector was food and beverage stores, which represented 27.4% of full- and part-time jobs within the retail trade sector. The top retail subsectors by number of jobs are presented in Table 1. Table 1: 2019 Jobs by retail trade subsector (top-5), Niagara Source: EMSI Analyst, 2020.1 dataset, employee and self-employed The Impact of COVID-19 on Retail Trade Employment Data from Statistics Canada’s monthly Labour Force Survey highlight a significant drop in the number of people employed in the wholesale and retail trade industry following the outbreak of the pandemic. Specifically, between February and June 2020, the number of people working in this industry decreased from 32,300 to 24,900 (see Figure 1). This shift in employment contrasts the typical seasonal increase that we see during this period and was significantly larger than what was seen during the first half of 2019. Figure 1: Number of people employed in the wholesale and retail trade industry, St. Catharines-Niagara CMA Source: Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey, Table: 14-10-0097-01 (formerly CANSIM 282-0130) The Impact of COVID-19 on Retail Trade Job Demand In addition to changes in employment, we can also examine the impact of COVID-19 on measureable job demand. As expected, we see a decrease in postings immediately after the pandemic was declared. Unique job postings for retail trade positions in Niagara declined from 1,176 in March to 956 in April. Since April, we have seen an increase in measureable job demand, such that unique job postings in July reached the same level seen in January (see Figure 2). We will continue to monitor job demand as local and provincial responses to COVID-19 adapt to changing realities over the coming months. Figure 2: Job postings by month, retail trade, January-July 2020, Niagara Source: EMSI Analyst 2020.1 Unique Job Postings by Industry, 2020 Keeping in mind that a number of retail businesses were deemed essential and, therefore, remained open, we broke down job posting data by retail trade subsector. Table 3 shows that job postings for clothing and clothing accessories stores decreased by 55 between January and July. In contrast, food and beverage stores saw an increase of 53 job postings over the same time period. Table 2: Job Postings by month retail trade subsectors, January-July 2020, Niagara Source: EMSI Analyst 2020.1 Unique Job Postings by Industry, 2020 As this project progresses, we will be closely monitoring the changes in retail trade employment in relation to COVID-19. As noted above, July 2020 saw a slight increase (200 people) in the number of people employed in wholesale and retail trade compared to June, though this number is still significantly lower than the employment numbers from February. At the same time, online job postings for positions in retail trade have already rebounded to their pre-pandemic levels, with July seeing 50 more unique job postings compared to February 2020. However, these postings have not been equally distributed among retail trade subsectors. We will continue monitoring employment and job posting trends to better understand whether these trends continue throughout the duration of the pandemic.

This piece focuses on the link between retail trade and tourism. Examining retail and tourism together allows us to compare the impacts of the pandemic on these sectors and assess their immediate needs. Other briefing notes in this series focus on the impact of the pandemic on retail from a national and provincial perspective, retail trade employees, and what a post-pandemic reality might look like for Niagara’s retail trade industry. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in Canada enacted a series of supports, recommendations, and by-laws to slow the spread of COVID-19. Though these supports and mandates helped slow the virus’ spread, they also impacted businesses and employment. Given the prevalence of tourism in the Niagara region, stay-at-home orders and border closures have had a significant impact on the local economy. Tourism and Retail Trade A 2018 report on Niagara’s Tourism Profile found that 2.4% of visitors to the region (316,000 visitors) travelled specifically for shopping.[1] Those who did not travel specifically to shop still spent significant amounts of money within the retail trade sector. Specifically, 38.8% of visitor expenses from Canadian tourists[2] travelling to Niagara were spent on food and beverage expenses and 11.2% were spent on clothing and other expenses.[3] Complete data on money spent by tourism activity are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Money spent by expenditure type, Canadian visitors to Niagara, 2017 Source: Niagara Tourism Profile. 2018. Niagara Region. Municipalities across Niagara have noted the intersection of retail trade and tourism in their local action plans. For example, the Town of Lincoln’s Tourism Strategy and Action Plan 2020-2025 recommended developing a tourism friendly downtown through the “concentration of tourism retail.”[4] This was suggested because “successful small-town destinations provide visitors with…appealing tourist retail and dining [experiences].”[5] In Niagara, examples of the intersection between retail trade, dining, and tourism include specialty food shops, artisan galleries at wineries, and restaurants that include specialty grocery sales. Tourism Jobs and Employment Throughout 2019, the tourism sector in Niagara housed an estimated 40,741 full- and part-time jobs including employees and self-employed individuals (see Table 2). These tourism-related jobs represented approximately 18.6% of all jobs in Niagara. Comparatively, the retail trade sector housed approximately 27,278 full- and part-time jobs in 2019 – approximately 12.4% of all jobs in Niagara (excluding self-employment). Table 2. 2019 job counts in Niagara’s tourism sectors Source: Emsi Analyst 2020.3 Calculations by NWPB A Statistics Canada framework for measuring tourism identified the sectors in Table 2 as essential to tourism. This is because any major reductions to tourism would significantly impact the revenues of these sectors. While an exact number of jobs lost to tourism due to COVID-19 is not available, we can estimate the potential impacts locally. Pairing current employment trends and 2019 job count data, NWPB estimates that Niagara saw an estimated 16,327 people lose employment in tourism. This would be a decrease of 42.3% in tourism-related employment between February and July 2020.[6] This decrease is particularly troubling as it comes at a time when tourism is usually at its peak in Niagara. Within Niagara, the wholesale and retail trade industry saw similar employment losses throughout COVID-19. Specifically, from February through July, the wholesale and retail trade sector saw an overall decrease of 7,200 people employed, or 22.3% of total employment prior to the pandemic. Table 3. Niagara residents reporting employment in tourism sectors, February-July 2020 Source: Statistics Canada. Table 14-10-0097-01 Employment by industry, three-month moving average, unadjusted for seasonality, census metropolitan areas (x 1,000). Calculations by NWPB. Retail and Tourism Businesses Data from the Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team (NERRT) also provide insights on the impact of COVID-19 on local tourism businesses.[7] The current report outlines data from respondents in the accommodation and food services industry. Though this industry does not represent every tourism-related business in Niagara, 66.3% of all tourism-related jobs can be found within the accommodation and food services sector. Moreover, within this sector, 96.4% of jobs are considered tourism-related. Data from the NERRT’s survey show that by the end of March, 63.2% of Niagara employers in accommodation and food services had already reported 76%-100% reductions in staff. Moreover, survey respondents from the accommodation and food services industry noted that if current conditions continued for six months, they expected revenue loss of $342.7 million (see Table 4). Table 4. Expected revenue loss due to COVID-19 for accommodation and food services businesses, Niagara Source: Niagara Economic Rapid Response Team Survey, Custom Tabulation Tourism and tourism-adjacent businesses have had to adjust to restricted in-person customer conditions and lowered economic activity during what would typically be their high season. As such, data from the NERRT survey further showed that accommodation and food services respondents were focused on the slow return of customers (54.0% of respondents), and cash flow and increased debt loads (39.8%). Similar trends were found from employers in retail with their main concerns also being slow return of customers (44.2%) and cash flow/increased debt (30.4%) again showing how these related sectors are experiencing similar difficulties in the wake of the pandemic. As a result of these economic challenges, we are beginning to hear anecdotal evidence that some of these businesses will be forced to close through their traditional “off-season” due to a lack of funds. Given the close link between tourism and retail trade, the spillover effect into Niagara’s retail trade sector will be monitored moving forward. These data present difficult realities for employers and employees working in Niagara’s tourism and retail trade-related sectors. [1] Niagara Tourism Profile. 2018.

[6] We stress that this number is an estimate of tourism-related employment numbers and job loss and should not be used as a definitive statement on the change in tourism-related employment during the pandemic. We are using two separate datasets to estimate these job loss figures and these numbers are approximations of job loss in this sector, rather than ironclad figure.

Our Local Labour Market Planning Report is built on evidence-based analysis of labour market strengths and challenges within the Niagara region. Community organizations, local government, job seekers, employers, and other Niagara stakeholders can gain valuable, up-to-date understanding of the full labour market landscape from the data in this report. We publish the Local Labour Market Planning Report annually alongside a series of municipal fact sheets. These smaller reports offer an up-to-date snapshot of population and employment patterns in Niagara’s 12 municipalities. Working together, we believe that sound planning will lead to future successes that will continue to make Niagara an excellent place to live and do business. Read the Current Report: This report offers a summary of the key labour market and economic indicators for 2020, as well as insights into 2021’s preliminary labour market trends. NWPB will be producing an update to this report in early 2022. Download the 2021 Labour Market Update through this link.

Last year NWPB published a report on the gendered employment impacts seen throughout the pandemic. This year we are publishing a series of briefing notes that highlight employment trends of youth in Niagara. In this first note, we wanted to start out with the basics and share some baseline information on youth living and working in Niagara. These insights help set the stage for conversations on youth employment, but also provide a local lens to work on youth-focused post-pandemic recovery that is occurring at a national level (e.g., Canadian Heritage Canada’s First State of Youth Report; YWCA Canada and YMCA Canada Preventing a Lockdown Generation: A Plan to Support Canada’s Youth in Post-Pandemic Recovery). click to download the infographic Youth Population Between 2001 and 2020, youth aged 15-29 comprise between 18.0% and 19.1% of the total population living in Niagara. Source: Statistics Canada. Table 17-10-0139-01 Population estimates, July 1, by census division, 2016 boundaries Youth Labour Force – Key Performance Indicators Data from Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey provide insights on the youth labour force (i.e., individuals age 15-24) that live in the St. Catharines-Niagara CMA. Below we see three key indicators for the local youth labour force: unemployment, participation, and employment rates. Throughout 2020, youth saw considerably higher unemployment rates and lower participation and employment rates than in 2019. Source: Statistics Canada. Table 14-10-0385-01 Labour force characteristics, annual Youth Employment Throughout the first year of the pandemic, we saw that employment for youth was considerably lower than what was seen in 2019. When we look at more recent trends in full-time employment, there has been a consistent decrease in the number of individuals reporting full-time employment between August 2020 and February 2021. In contrast, youth working part time experienced a significant decline between February and May 2020, with a subsequent increase in the fall, which likely reflected seasonal hiring trends.

Last year NWPB published a report on the gendered employment impacts seen throughout the pandemic. This year we are publishing a series of briefing notes that highlight employment trends of youth in Niagara. In this first note, we wanted to start out with the basics and share some baseline information on youth living and working in Niagara. These insights help set the stage for conversations on youth employment, but also provide a local lens to work on youth-focused post-pandemic recovery that is occurring at a national level (e.g., Canadian Heritage Canada’s First State of Youth Report; YWCA Canada and YMCA Canada Preventing a Lockdown Generation: A Plan to Support Canada’s Youth in Post-Pandemic Recovery). click to download the infographic Youth Population Between 2001 and 2020, youth aged 15-29 comprise between 18.0% and 19.1% of the total population living in Niagara. Source: Statistics Canada. Table 17-10-0139-01 Population estimates, July 1, by census division, 2016 boundaries Youth Labour Force – Key Performance Indicators Data from Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey provide insights on the youth labour force (i.e., individuals age 15-24) that live in the St. Catharines-Niagara CMA. Below we see three key indicators for the local youth labour force: unemployment, participation, and employment rates. Throughout 2020, youth saw considerably higher unemployment rates and lower participation and employment rates than in 2019. Source: Statistics Canada. Table 14-10-0385-01 Labour force characteristics, annual Youth Employment Throughout the first year of the pandemic, we saw that employment for youth was considerably lower than what was seen in 2019. When we look at more recent trends in full-time employment, there has been a consistent decrease in the number of individuals reporting full-time employment between August 2020 and February 2021. In contrast, youth working part time experienced a significant decline between February and May 2020, with a subsequent increase in the fall, which likely reflected seasonal hiring trends.

This project builds on previous work examining youth employment in Niagara. Over the past year COVID-19 has significantly impacted youth employment. This project dives deeper into these impacts and pairs available labour force data with insights from local youth, collaborators in post-secondary education, and our local school boards to support long-term career planning. While portions of this project are published as briefing notes and reports, having access to youth-related employment data is important to support the ongoing dialogue around pandemic recovery. To provide up-to-date insights, we have a youth employment dashboard which outlines monthly employment indicators and is paired with historical trends. Combining these data with local insights gleaned through consultations, we will continue working towards successes that promote Niagara as an excellent place to live and do business.
