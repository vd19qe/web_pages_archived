Ils ont aussi présenté des événements aux Jeux olympiques d’hiver de 2010 à Vancouver et des Jeux panaméricains de 2015 à Toronto, ainsi qu’aux Philippines et à Corée du Sud.

En nomination pour de nombreux de JUNO en 2015, et récipiendaire du prix JUNO pour l’album country de l’année, Moskaluke est une gagnante du SOCAN 2017 et honorée trois fois de la prix CCMA pour l’artiste féminine de l’année (2014, 2015 and 2016) – la première résidente de la Saskatchewan dans l’histoire des prix.

Following the advice of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer and the Government of Ontario, Niagara Parks joins Ontario’s other attraction agencies and convention centres by closing down public facilities. What is Niagara Parks doing to enforce the emergency orders on its property? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA), Provincial Offences Officers in addition to Niagara Parks Police Service Officers are authorized to enforce all emergency orders issued by the Province. This enforcement is at the discretion of the Niagara Parks Police Service. In keeping with our standard approach of engagement and education, Niagara Parks Police Service will seek to inform members of the public on the measures that are in place to protect all of our safety as we fight the spread of COVID-19.

Though we have closed off access to all public boat launches due to challenges with physical and social distancing, Niagara Parks does allow fishing on its properties along the river. Am I able to hike at Niagara Parks? While trails do remain open, Niagara Parks is sharing the message of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health that residents should be staying home at this time. Marked trails at hiking areas such as the Niagara Glen remain open due to the risk of unsanctioned trail use in this area. The Niagara River Recreation Trail is public space that remains open and accessible. For individuals that are continuing to use trails, they must exercise caution and maintain the safe physical distance of at least two metres apart from others. As a reminder, the safest way to exercise outdoors is to stay within your own neighbourhood. Are parking lots open? Niagara Parks parking lots remain open with added signage helping everyone to stay informed on the emergency orders in place to stop the spread of COVID-19.

(Nature areas, gardens, hiking trails, etc.) On March 31, the Government of Ontario extended closures to include all outdoor recreational amenities. As such, Niagara Parks has closed all remaining picnic areas, playgrounds, public washrooms, park shelters and any other item that is high touch or encourages the gathering of people. Following direction from the Province, public areas, green spaces and recreational trails remain open for walkthrough access only. Please maintain physical distancing of at least 2 metres if walking through these public spaces. Are any public washrooms open? No, all public washrooms in Niagara Parks are now closed to help stop the spread of COVID-19. How is Niagara Parks protecting its staff? The health and safety of our staff and our guests are of the utmost concern to Niagara Parks. It is for this reason that we have decided to close all public-facing facilities to do our part to contain the spread of COVID-19. Following the advice of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer and the Government of Ontario, Niagara Parks joins Ontario’s other attraction agencies and convention centres by closing down public facilities. What is Niagara Parks doing to enforce the emergency orders on its property? Under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA), Provincial Offences Officers in addition to Niagara Parks Police Service Officers are authorized to enforce all emergency orders issued by the Province. This enforcement is at the discretion of the Niagara Parks Police Service. In keeping with our standard approach of engagement and education, Niagara Parks Police Service will seek to inform members of the public on the measures that are in place to protect all of our safety as we fight the spread of COVID-19. How do I report activity that goes against the emergency orders established by the Province on Niagara Parks property?

Is fishing allowed on Niagara Parks property? First and foremost, Niagara Parks echoes the advice of public health officials, asking everyone to please stay home. At this time, fishing is permitted under the current provincial emergency orders, provided that individuals are following all relevant regulations and practising safe physical and social distancing. Though we have closed off access to all public boat launches due to challenges with physical and social distancing, Niagara Parks does allow fishing on its properties along the river. Am I able to hike at Niagara Parks? While trails do remain open, Niagara Parks is sharing the message of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health that residents should be staying home at this time. Marked trails at hiking areas such as the Niagara Glen remain open due to the risk of unsanctioned trail use in this area. The Niagara River Recreation Trail is public space that remains open and accessible. For individuals that are continuing to use trails, they must exercise caution and maintain the safe physical distance of at least two metres apart from others. As a reminder, the safest way to exercise outdoors is to stay within your own neighbourhood. Are parking lots open? Niagara Parks parking lots remain open with added signage helping everyone to stay informed on the emergency orders in place to stop the spread of COVID-19. Following direction from the Province, Niagara Parks’ public spaces, parks and recreation trails remain open for walk-through access only.

As the ice retreated northward, its melt waters began to flow down through what became Lake Erie, the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. Niagara Falls was originally located at the escarpment at Queenston-Lewiston and continued to steadily erode through the bedrock to it's current location over the next 10,000 years.

As the ice retreated northward, its melt waters began to flow down through what became Lake Erie, the Niagara River and Lake Ontario.

As the ice retreated northward, its melt waters began to flow down through what became Lake Erie, the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. Niagara Falls was originally located at the escarpment at Queenston-Lewiston and continued to steadily erode through the bedrock to it's current location over the next 10,000 years.

Niagara Parks continues to closely monitor all announcements from the Province and will update our policies and procedures accordingly. Health and Safety Measures Niagara Parks is following industry leading standards around health and safety at all of its attractions. Staff are provided with safety training to ensure all health and safety requirements are met at all times. All employees complete a screening questionnaire before the start of their shift to ensure they are not experiencing any symptoms. Enhanced cleaning measures are in place including frequent cleaning of washrooms and all high-touch surfaces. The application of long-lasting antibacterial disinfecting solution and reduced capacity is in place in elevators. Hand sanitizer is available for all staff and guests. Based on guidelines set out by the Ontario government, all Niagara Parks buildings that are open to the public at this time are operating at reduced capacity to ensure guests have ample space while indoors. All attractions are operating at a reduced capacity to allow for maximum space between guests. Hand sanitizer is available at all entrances Several Niagara Parks buildings have been outfitted with people counters to track entrances and exits into buildings to allow for capacity management in real-time. Stanchions and floor markings are in place to ensure orderly and organized queuing. Ambassadors are available in some parking lots at queuing concourses and areas to assist guests with navigation to entrances and exits and admit entry to sites and attractions. Entry to attractions is based on timed ticketed entry to track capacity. In Table Rock Centre, a thermal camera has been installed to conduct temperature screening at Niagara Parks most visited attraction, Journey Behind the Falls. Counter staff and host stations are protected by plexiglass guards. We encourage the use of payments by tap payment of credit and debit cards over using cash.
