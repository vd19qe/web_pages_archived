It is designed to support the many ministries and programs shared by the people of our diocese. Our bishop, Susan Bell, says the new name makes a bold commitment. “It’s a statement of confidence in God’s church – that the ministries we support with intention now will flourish long into the future. It is also a statement that faith is being ignited in and through works of love and mercy in our parish communities up and down the diocese.” This initiative is a way to easily learn about the ministries and programs we support as a diocese. It also provides ways you can be involved with your gifts of time, skills, and finances. Please join us as we strengthen our communities of faith, belonging, outreach ministries, and programs as we build our faith in the future. As the mission statement of the Anglican Diocese of Niagara states: Ignited by the irresistible love of Jesus and renewed by the Holy Spirit, we partner with God to deepen faith, share stories and care for God’s world. Make your bold commitment now and ignite possibility and creativity for the future of our faith.
