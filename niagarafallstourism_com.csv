March, 17, 2020 Niagara Falls, as an iconic travel destination, has responded to cautionary measures recommended by public health agencies, provincial and federal governments, to further enhance safety of staff and visitors. Quickly changing circumstances around COVID-19 (coronavirus) and efforts to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in the temporary closure of all dine-in restaurants and bars, except those that offer take out or delivery in Ontario. The announcement was made on Tuesday morning by Premier Doug Ford following the guidance by Ontario's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams. Health officials are now also instructing people to avoid social gatherings of more than 50 people. As businesses rapidly adapt to daily updates from health officials, many are faced with the difficult decision to close or significantly adjust their operations. The resulting impact on restaurants, theatres and attractions of all types ultimately impacts the demand for hotel accommodation in a tourist destination like Niagara Falls. Hotels with shared overhead among multiple properties are consolidating efforts to maintain operational efficiencies and provide guests with exceptional service during their stay. Niagara Falls Tourism continues to compile and review all available information on this changing situation and updates are available at www.niagarafallstourism.com.

When travel advisories are cleared, demand will return and Niagara Falls will once again welcome international and domestic guests to experience the extraordinary wonder.

Quickly changing circumstances around COVID-19 (coronavirus) and efforts to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in the temporary closure of all dine-in restaurants and bars, except those that offer take out or delivery in Ontario. The announcement was made on Tuesday morning by Premier Doug Ford following the guidance by Ontario's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams. Health officials are now also instructing people to avoid social gatherings of more than 50 people. As businesses rapidly adapt to daily updates from health officials, many are faced with the difficult decision to close or significantly adjust their operations. The resulting impact on restaurants, theatres and attractions of all types ultimately impacts the demand for hotel accommodation in a tourist destination like Niagara Falls. Hotels with shared overhead among multiple properties are consolidating efforts to maintain operational efficiencies and provide guests with exceptional service during their stay. Niagara Falls Tourism continues to compile and review all available information on this changing situation and updates are available at www.niagarafallstourism.com. Click here to send an email inquiry to our staff. When travel advisories are cleared, demand will return and Niagara Falls will once again welcome international and domestic guests to experience the extraordinary wonder. In the meantime, there are wonderful opportunities to discover the natural beauty of the Falls, many hiking and walking trails in the area and to enjoy the amenities and services provided by dedicated operators in the accommodation sector. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

While Niagara Falls remains a safe and welcoming destination, we know that COVID-19 remains top of mind for many travellers.

We are all in this together! ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... March, 17, 2020 Niagara Falls, as an iconic travel destination, has responded to cautionary measures recommended by public health agencies, provincial and federal governments, to further enhance safety of staff and visitors. Quickly changing circumstances around COVID-19 (coronavirus) and efforts to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in the temporary closure of all dine-in restaurants and bars, except those that offer take out or delivery in Ontario. The announcement was made on Tuesday morning by Premier Doug Ford following the guidance by Ontario's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams. Health officials are now also instructing people to avoid social gatherings of more than 50 people. As businesses rapidly adapt to daily updates from health officials, many are faced with the difficult decision to close or significantly adjust their operations. The resulting impact on restaurants, theatres and attractions of all types ultimately impacts the demand for hotel accommodation in a tourist destination like Niagara Falls. Hotels with shared overhead among multiple properties are consolidating efforts to maintain operational efficiencies and provide guests with exceptional service during their stay. Niagara Falls Tourism continues to compile and review all available information on this changing situation and updates are available at www.niagarafallstourism.com. Click here to send an email inquiry to our staff. When travel advisories are cleared, demand will return and Niagara Falls will once again welcome international and domestic guests to experience the extraordinary wonder. In the meantime, there are wonderful opportunities to discover the natural beauty of the Falls, many hiking and walking trails in the area and to enjoy the amenities and services provided by dedicated operators in the accommodation sector. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Below you will find official resources regarding the coronavirus as they relate to health and safety, and travel advisories. While Niagara Falls remains a safe and welcoming destination, we know that COVID-19 remains top of mind for many travellers.

Visitors are of course still able to view the Falls, only with fewer amenities within steps of the brink.

We are all in this together! ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... March, 17, 2020 Niagara Falls, as an iconic travel destination, has responded to cautionary measures recommended by public health agencies, provincial and federal governments, to further enhance safety of staff and visitors. Quickly changing circumstances around COVID-19 (coronavirus) and efforts to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in the temporary closure of all dine-in restaurants and bars, except those that offer take out or delivery in Ontario. The announcement was made on Tuesday morning by Premier Doug Ford following the guidance by Ontario's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams. Health officials are now also instructing people to avoid social gatherings of more than 50 people. As businesses rapidly adapt to daily updates from health officials, many are faced with the difficult decision to close or significantly adjust their operations. The resulting impact on restaurants, theatres and attractions of all types ultimately impacts the demand for hotel accommodation in a tourist destination like Niagara Falls. Hotels with shared overhead among multiple properties are consolidating efforts to maintain operational efficiencies and provide guests with exceptional service during their stay. Niagara Falls Tourism continues to compile and review all available information on this changing situation and updates are available at www.niagarafallstourism.com.

When travel advisories are cleared, demand will return and Niagara Falls will once again welcome international and domestic guests to experience the extraordinary wonder.

Health officials are now also instructing people to avoid social gatherings of more than 50 people. As businesses rapidly adapt to daily updates from health officials, many are faced with the difficult decision to close or significantly adjust their operations. The resulting impact on restaurants, theatres and attractions of all types ultimately impacts the demand for hotel accommodation in a tourist destination like Niagara Falls.

Quickly changing circumstances around COVID-19 (coronavirus) and efforts to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in the temporary closure of all dine-in restaurants and bars, except those that offer take out or delivery in Ontario. The announcement was made on Tuesday morning by Premier Doug Ford following the guidance by Ontario's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams. Health officials are now also instructing people to avoid social gatherings of more than 50 people. As businesses rapidly adapt to daily updates from health officials, many are faced with the difficult decision to close or significantly adjust their operations. The resulting impact on restaurants, theatres and attractions of all types ultimately impacts the demand for hotel accommodation in a tourist destination like Niagara Falls. Hotels with shared overhead among multiple properties are consolidating efforts to maintain operational efficiencies and provide guests with exceptional service during their stay.

March, 17, 2020 Niagara Falls, as an iconic travel destination, has responded to cautionary measures recommended by public health agencies, provincial and federal governments, to further enhance safety of staff and visitors. Quickly changing circumstances around COVID-19 (coronavirus) and efforts to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in the temporary closure of all dine-in restaurants and bars, except those that offer take out or delivery in Ontario. The announcement was made on Tuesday morning by Premier Doug Ford following the guidance by Ontario's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams. Health officials are now also instructing people to avoid social gatherings of more than 50 people. As businesses rapidly adapt to daily updates from health officials, many are faced with the difficult decision to close or significantly adjust their operations. The resulting impact on restaurants, theatres and attractions of all types ultimately impacts the demand for hotel accommodation in a tourist destination like Niagara Falls. Hotels with shared overhead among multiple properties are consolidating efforts to maintain operational efficiencies and provide guests with exceptional service during their stay.
