By Sarah Dobson Aug 06, 2020 Share More than half (54 per cent) of Canadians are afraid to return to the workplace because of how contagious the COVID-19 virus is. And six in 10 will refuse to go back if they feel it’s not safe enough, according to a survey by KPMG in Canada. Their biggest concerns? Colleagues who might come to work sick or be asymptomatic (77 per cent) followed by sharing common spaces such as meeting or lunch rooms (57 per cent), and air ventilation and circulation (40 per cent). But, as long as the number of COVID cases remain relatively low, up to 72 per cent of Canadians say they would be OK going back to their physical workplace, although they believe there will be a second wave of infections in the fall or winter that will shut down workplaces all over again. Many workers (84 per cent) say they’d be more loyal to their employer or willing to give the extra effort when they know their company cares and is focused on keeping them safe, finds the survey of 1,010 people between July 22 and 24. And three in five would use an employer’s smartphone app to help them avoid busy and crowded office areas, though slightly more than a quarter (26 per cent) expressing concern about app geo-tracking privacy. “Canadians are placing a great deal of trust in their employers to manage their return to the workplace and in keeping them safe,” says Doron Melnick, partner and acting lead of KPMG’s people and change advisory services practice. “The pandemic is forcing every employer in the country to adopt comprehensive protocols and safety measures, and to look at new ways of staying connected to their employees.” Canada's tourism sector is focused on safety as employers redo business models, says one industry expert who spoke with Canadian HR Reporter.

By Jim Wilson Jul 31, 2020 Share Many remote workers do not have the tools they need to be comfortable working from home, according to a report by the University of Cincinnati. While the majority (58 per cent) have some type of office chair, 27 per cent use dining chairs while 15 per cent work sitting on beds or couches. Many chairs were also too low (41 per cent), which resulted in poor body or poor head position, while 63 per cent sit on chairs with a hard surface, found the survey of 4,300 staff and 4,200 faculty members at the university. More than half (53 per cent) of the workers have armrests on their chairs, but many people do not use them (32 per cent) or the armrest is improperly adjusted (18 per cent). This can cause contact stress on forearms and strain across the upper back, according to the report. Also, more than 90 per cent of workstations have a hard, sharp edge. Also, 69 per cent of workers do not use the support of the back of the chair and 73 per cent oftentimes do not have any lumbar support (73 per cent). “Home offices will need to incorporate sound ergonomic concepts to ensure the long-term health of the workers,” say the authors of The Home Office: Ergonomic Lessons From the “New Normal.” “As the home offices become a permanent option for many workers, companies will need to provide proper accommodations with respect to ergonomics, otherwise, the widespread discomfort will progress into more detrimental conditions such as musculoskeletal disorders.” Sarah Dobson, editor of the Canadian HR Reporter group, recently talked about the ergonomic challenges of working from home during the pandemic. Computer challenges More than a quarter (29 per cent) of remote workers use laptop monitors, 39 per cent use a combination of laptop and external monitor, 17 per cent use external monitors only and 10 per cent use multiple monitors, found the university survey. Three-quarters of the monitors were laptops, which were too low relative to the workers’ eye height. External monitors are also set up too low (52 per cent) or too high (four per cent). There is also a lack of the primary screens centred in front of the workers (31 per cent), resulting in twisting of the neck or back to view the monitor. Fifty-four per cent use laptop keyboards while 46 per cent use external keyboards. “You can use your laptop from home, but it is designed to be a short-term option. It should be used for a few hours while travelling. It is not meant to be used for eight or nine hours each day,” says Kermit Davis, an expert in office ergonomics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Potential solutions There are several ways to address issues with the workspace at home, according to the report: Chairs: Put a pillow on the seat to elevate the seat height. Put a pillow or rolled-up towel behind the back to provide lumbar support and back support. Wrap the armrests when they are low and not adjustable. Move the chair closer to the desk or table to encourage having the back against the back of the seat. Computers Place a lap desk or large pillow under the laptop to raise the monitor when using it on the lap. Use an external keyboard and mouse, along with raising the monitor by placing a stack of books or a box under the laptop when using a laptop on a desk. Use an external monitor at the right height (top at eye height) and centred on you. When using dual or multiple monitors, keep the primary monitor directly in front of you and place the secondary monitors to the side of the primary monitor Desk Place a folded towel over the edge on the desk and in front of the keyboard. Use pipe insulation from a local hardware store, or a pool noodle, which can be split down the seam and placed along the edge. Randstad and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety also recommend these health habits: Stand up, stretch and move one to three minutes for every 30 minutes you spend sitting. Use an alarm to remind yourself to get up throughout the day. Stand up when you're on the phone and move around. Musculoskeletal conditions have the most impact on employers’ overall health-care costs, according to a North American survey released in late 2019.

By Jim Wilson Jul 30, 2020 Share With the onset of the pandemic, 49 per cent of Canadian organizations have furloughed or laid off employees while 46 per cent have implemented hiring freeze, according to a Mercer survey. Amongst those laid off or furloughed, only about one in four (28 per cent) are still working from the work site or office, while nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) are working remotely. And two in five companies (40 per cent) believe the majority of these remote workers will eventually be required to return to the physical work environment, found the survey of 265 employers. Two in five (40 per cent) employers have identified resource contingency plans, 30 per cent have frozen or reduced salaries or bonuses while 28 per cent have introduced a rotational working schedule. “Given future uncertainty, the opportunity to optimize costs and plan the right workforce is now,” says Mercer’s report Transition Forward: Reinvent for Success. “Evaluating cost synergies, new-found efficiencies, and financial plans, as well as ensuring the workforce reflects capabilities required both for today and tomorrow will be critical to success — and, ultimately, to reinventing to growth.” Leadership support Encouragingly, more than eight in 10 respondents (83 per cent) are confident that senior leaders have a detailed plan for the return to work while 78 per cent feel their organization is ready to adapt HR and talent strategies. Sixty-three per cent also believe that middle managers are equipped to support employees through the change and 48 per cent believe their organization is considering strategies to manage risk and ensure sustainability post COVID-19, finds Mercer. Two-thirds of Canadian organizations are looking to enhance the employee experience by evolving specific elements to improve retention. The top priorities include: flexible work arrangements (37 per cent) mental/wellness programs (30 per cent) digital wellness solutions (28 per cent) wellness/health spending account (20 per cent) financial wellness (17 per cent) “Elements of the employee value proposition must be refreshed and evaluated frequently — especially in times of unprecedented change,” says Mercer. “New ways of working have challenged the employee experience, and organizations must invest in — and prioritize elements (i.e. technology) that will enable flexibility and an effective transition to the new normal — especially for critical talent and key roles.” Canadians in general are stressing over money (38 per cent) more than personal health (25 per cent), work (21 per cent) and relationships (16 per cent), according to a survey released by FP Canada.

Report suggests incentive to stay home is ‘small and perhaps negligible’ There’s no clear evidence that the CERB is currently disincentivizing jobless workers to search for and begin new jobs, say two economists. By Jim Wilson Aug 14, 2020 Share There’s been talk that the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) program is discouraging people from getting back to work and employers were having trouble finding the staff that they needed. Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister also called on the federal government to amend the CERB, saying it “is increasingly acting as a work disincentive to some Canadians, as it penalizes them financially for returning to work full time.” But in looking at stats from the government’s latest Labour Force Survey, economists at the C.D. Howe Institute see no clear evidence that the CERB is disincentivizing jobless workers to search for and begin new jobs. In a memo addressed to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Tammy Schirle and Mikal Skuterud show that between February and April, aggregate hours worked by those earning less than $15 per hour dropped by 51 per cent, while hours worked by those earning $35 per hour or more dropped by 10 per cent. By July, Canada’s lowest wage workers were the slowest to return to work as businesses re-opened, with the aggregate hours for those earning less than $15 per hour remained 30 per cent below pre-shutdown levels, while the hours of those earning $35 per hour or more had actually increased to levels higher than in February. While the job search activity of workers who are jobless – having lost their jobs after mid-February – was exceptionally low in March and April while many businesses were closed, “as businesses started to reopen in the spring, search activity picked up and has now reached normal levels (in comparison to search activity among jobless workers following the 2008-9 recession or at the same time last summer).” The C.D. Howe economists also say that there is no evidence that the earnings threshold for CERB eligibility is preventing low-earning workers from taking new jobs. In looking at newly hired workers in Canada, the proportion of those earning $2,000 in those new jobs fell in March, April and May, but since then their numbers have gone up so that low earner’s representation among new hires has returned to the levels seen in the summers of 2018 and 2019. “As labour economists, we are normally acutely concerned about the work incentive effects of worker income support programs,” say Schirle and Skuterud. “However, despite our best efforts, we see no clear evidence that the CERB is currently disincentivizing jobless workers to search for and begin new jobs.” While public health efforts to keep people at home, along with the risks of COVID-19 and the CERB incentive may have led to low job numbers, the recent government numbers suggest that the work incentive effects of a short-term emergency benefit like CERB are “if anything, small and perhaps even negligible,” say the economists. “Because workers know the benefit is temporary, their concerns for ensuring employment in the longer term appear to be driving their behaviour. When job opportunities arise in the current uncertain climate, it is too risky to turn down those opportunities.” Changes to EI, CERB Recently, the federal government set a temporary minimum unemployment rate of 13.1 per cent for all employment insurance (EI) economic regions across Canada to help individuals who will begin transitioning off of the CERB program. On Aug. 5 MP Leah Gazan submitted a motion to convert the CERB into a permanent Guaranteed Livable Basic Income and asked the public to sign a petition, which thus far has received more than 12,000 signatures. The motion is “the first initiative before the House of Commons during the COVID-19 pandemic to address poverty as a human rights crisis, which calls on Canada to take action, introduce legislation, and work with provincial and territorial governments and Indigenous peoples to ensure that a Guaranteed Livable Basic Income replace the Canada Emergency Response Benefit on an ongoing and permanent basis in a concerted effort to eradicate poverty and ensure the respect, dignity and security of all persons in Canada.” Latest stories Canadian pensions outperform global peers More workers encouraged to use vacation days: Survey Payroll flexibility key in pandemic: Survey Free newsletter The Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date on news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

Canadian HR Reporter asked Toronto employment lawyer Andrew Monkhouse of Monkhouse Law about what things should be considered before embarking on a global quest for talent. Q: What should employers be thinking about when looking abroad for talent? A: “No employer in Canada should be considering hiring employees in other countries unless they are making a very large endeavour for it; it’s very complicated if you have people working for you in other countries that are subject to their laws, they’re subject to their taxes. “It’s best to work with… specific outsourcing corporations and have them employ the individuals, have them deal with those local issues, because there can be a lot of issues associated with hiring people in other countries; it becomes easier within Canada because the law is relatively standard for employment law across Canada. “Lots of companies, even small companies, hire people in different provinces. But it is important to make sure that the contracts take into account the individual differences between the provinces. But generally it’s fairly easy to hire people in different provinces.” Q: What about hiring from the U.S., how different is that from Canadian employment laws? A: “The United States, it’s very different. It’s state by state because the states are more different than in Canada. As an example, it doesn’t apply directly to employment law, but every state has its own criminal code for instance, whereas in Canada, there’s one criminal code… it’s much more difficult hiring people in the United States, because you have to comply with all of their regulations. “You probably need local legal counsel as well as legal counsel from the jurisdiction that you’re coming from to work on a deal like that.” Q: Should remote workers be considered permanent employees, contractors or freelancers? A: “If companies are hiring, often when they’re small, there’s a tendency to have contractors. But if they’re hiring a lot of people, then usually it makes sense to take the jump and have them be called employees. “If a contractor is doing 100 per cent of work for the company, then they’re not an independent contractor, they’re a dependent contractor which means they are still owed certain duties and could unionize, for instance, if there’s more than one of them, or they could even be counted as an employee. “Contractors [are OK] if you’re willing to let them actually be independent and you don’t have security and privacy concerns that would require them to be employees. “Many of those might meet the definition of being an employee if the contractor chooses to fight it out. But as long as the contractor and the employer agree the person is a contractor, very often we can see that relationship continuing. “It’s only when there’s problems, say the contractor gets terminated [and] after many years, the contractor is upset they didn’t get paid vacation pay, that it really comes up as an issue. Andrew Monkhouse “In terms of selecting whether or not people are employees or independent contractors, it might be whether or not the company is eligible for the CEWS [Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy] because for contractors, there’s no wage subsidy; there’s almost a 90-per-cent wage subsidy, depending on how much your revenue has fallen, for employees. “If your revenue has fallen a lot, we’re seeing more people choose to hire people as employees because they get a wage subsidy because the government is really pushing employment and less so having people be contractors.” Q: What are best practices for video interviews with remote employees? A: “From a non-legal perspective and advising clients, I tend to say, ‘Be more understanding.’ If someone’s partner walks by in the background, or a kid comes on for a second or a pet decides to cuddle a screen, it happens on both sides and you need to be more understanding. Things aren’t going to be as ‘perfect’ as they are expected to be in in-person interviews. “Even if someone has to do the interview from a coffee shop because suddenly their internet goes out in their house, there should be less game breakers in the way that showing up 10 minutes late is usually seen in in-person interviews. If someone’s Zoom randomly stops working or Microsoft Teams for some reason decides to fail on them, there just needs to be more understanding in terms of that.” Q: Do remote workers need a separate policy? A: “They should make sure that they outlined when people will be working, when it’s expected they’ll be available to take calls, because I know a lot of managers get frustrated: They say, ‘I called at 9:30, but then the person wasn’t available.’ The expectations should be set out up front. “It should be set up to say what their deliverables are, what their key goals are going to be, because there is sometimes often a feeling that remote workers feel they’re often working harder. And their bosses sometimes think they’re not working as hard because they don’t see them. “[There are] an untold amount of remote workers that I represent where they say, ‘My work was amazing, I don’t understand,’ and the other side says, ‘No, the work was bad. I felt I could never contact them.’ The discrepancy is because of lack of communication, that’s one thing. “There’s a number of considerations in terms of confidentiality and privacy, obviously, if someone’s going to be handling credit card information, and their spouse is at home. Or maybe one person works for the CRA [Canada Revenue Agency] and one person works with an accountant… we hear about these sorts of circumstances sometimes so there’s a lot of considerations.” Q: Do remote workers need a separate employment contract? A: “What you’re probably going to see more so is amendments to the contract, so probably a one-off, or appendix or amendments to the contract or updated policies for the company as a whole. I don’t know if people are going to be signing many new contracts, we haven’t seen a lot of that. “The bigger issue tends to be, to some extent, what happens when an employer says, ‘OK, Ontario’s in phase three or phase four [or] we don’t have any more COVID-19, come back to work’ and the employees say, ‘I can’t come back to work starting Monday, my dogs have gotten used to me being at home’ or ‘We’ve decided to opt my kid out of school’ or ‘I don’t have aftercare because the daycare is closed.’ “My understanding is approximately 20 to 25 per cent of employees, where the business says everybody should come back, they say, ‘I’m not coming, I don’t feel comfortable.’ Twenty to 25 per cent when pushed, refused or returned to work. That’s the key problem at the moment for a lot of companies. “It’s best to have contract additions that set out all of these obligations: When’s the employee to come back? Under what conditions will that be? It’s better to have people sign off on that or have new policies that make it very clear what the expectations will be so that way, people aren’t surprised.” Previously, we asked five key questions on screening returning employees while another survey wondered if the nine-to-five workday was a thing of the past.

There is also a lack of the primary screens centred in front of the workers (31 per cent), resulting in twisting of the neck or back to view the monitor. Fifty-four per cent use laptop keyboards while 46 per cent use external keyboards. “You can use your laptop from home, but it is designed to be a short-term option. It should be used for a few hours while travelling. It is not meant to be used for eight or nine hours each day,” says Kermit Davis, an expert in office ergonomics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Potential solutions There are several ways to address issues with the workspace at home, according to the report: Chairs: Put a pillow on the seat to elevate the seat height. Put a pillow or rolled-up towel behind the back to provide lumbar support and back support. Wrap the armrests when they are low and not adjustable. Move the chair closer to the desk or table to encourage having the back against the back of the seat. Computers Place a lap desk or large pillow under the laptop to raise the monitor when using it on the lap. Use an external keyboard and mouse, along with raising the monitor by placing a stack of books or a box under the laptop when using a laptop on a desk. Use an external monitor at the right height (top at eye height) and centred on you. When using dual or multiple monitors, keep the primary monitor directly in front of you and place the secondary monitors to the side of the primary monitor Desk Place a folded towel over the edge on the desk and in front of the keyboard. Use pipe insulation from a local hardware store, or a pool noodle, which can be split down the seam and placed along the edge. Randstad and the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety also recommend these health habits: Stand up, stretch and move one to three minutes for every 30 minutes you spend sitting. Use an alarm to remind yourself to get up throughout the day. Stand up when you're on the phone and move around. Musculoskeletal conditions have the most impact on employers’ overall health-care costs, according to a North American survey released in late 2019.

Report suggests incentive to stay home is ‘small and perhaps negligible’ There’s no clear evidence that the CERB is currently disincentivizing jobless workers to search for and begin new jobs, say two economists. By Jim Wilson Aug 17, 2020 Share There’s been talk that the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) program is discouraging people from getting back to work and employers were having trouble finding the staff that they needed. Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister also called on the federal government to amend the CERB, saying it “is increasingly acting as a work disincentive to some Canadians, as it penalizes them financially for returning to work full time.” But in looking at stats from the government’s latest Labour Force Survey, economists at the C.D. Howe Institute see no clear evidence that the CERB is disincentivizing jobless workers to search for and begin new jobs. In a memo addressed to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Tammy Schirle and Mikal Skuterud show that between February and April, aggregate hours worked by those earning less than $15 per hour dropped by 51 per cent, while hours worked by those earning $35 per hour or more dropped by 10 per cent. By July, Canada’s lowest wage workers were the slowest to return to work as businesses re-opened, with the aggregate hours for those earning less than $15 per hour remained 30 per cent below pre-shutdown levels, while the hours of those earning $35 per hour or more had actually increased to levels higher than in February. While the job search activity of workers who are jobless – having lost their jobs after mid-February – was exceptionally low in March and April while many businesses were closed, “as businesses started to reopen in the spring, search activity picked up and has now reached normal levels (in comparison to search activity among jobless workers following the 2008-9 recession or at the same time last summer).” The C.D. Howe economists also say that there is no evidence that the earnings threshold for CERB eligibility is preventing low-earning workers from taking new jobs. In looking at newly hired workers in Canada, the proportion of those earning $2,000 in those new jobs fell in March, April and May, but since then their numbers have gone up so that low earner’s representation among new hires has returned to the levels seen in the summers of 2018 and 2019. “As labour economists, we are normally acutely concerned about the work incentive effects of worker income support programs,” say Schirle and Skuterud. “However, despite our best efforts, we see no clear evidence that the CERB is currently disincentivizing jobless workers to search for and begin new jobs.” While public health efforts to keep people at home, along with the risks of COVID-19 and the CERB incentive may have led to low job numbers, the recent government numbers suggest that the work incentive effects of a short-term emergency benefit like CERB are “if anything, small and perhaps even negligible,” say the economists. “Because workers know the benefit is temporary, their concerns for ensuring employment in the longer term appear to be driving their behaviour. When job opportunities arise in the current uncertain climate, it is too risky to turn down those opportunities.” Changes to EI, CERB Recently, the federal government set a temporary minimum unemployment rate of 13.1 per cent for all employment insurance (EI) economic regions across Canada to help individuals who will begin transitioning off of the CERB program. On Aug. 5 MP Leah Gazan submitted a motion to convert the CERB into a permanent Guaranteed Livable Basic Income and asked the public to sign a petition, which thus far has received more than 12,000 signatures. The motion is “the first initiative before the House of Commons during the COVID-19 pandemic to address poverty as a human rights crisis, which calls on Canada to take action, introduce legislation, and work with provincial and territorial governments and Indigenous peoples to ensure that a Guaranteed Livable Basic Income replace the Canada Emergency Response Benefit on an ongoing and permanent basis in a concerted effort to eradicate poverty and ensure the respect, dignity and security of all persons in Canada.” Latest stories Major changes to CERB, EI announced Is paid sick leave needed to avoid ‘public health hazard’?

By Jim Wilson Aug 27, 2020 Share Matching the sentiments of many Canadians, employees in the U.S. and U.K. have strong concerns about returning to the workplace, citing safety risks amid the pandemic. Nearly eight in 10 federal employees in the U.S. who have been working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic say they feel unsafe returning to work, according to a worker survey conducted by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). For those employees already at the worksite, 69 per cent of say there is a COVID-19 workplace safety plan in place, and 56.2 per cent of those who require personal protective equipment (PPE) to do their jobs say their worksites have adequate supplies. Yet 70.5 per cent do not believe that health and safety best practices are being followed, found the survey of nearly 2,200 respondents. In Canada, 69 per cent workers say they would feel more comfortable being back at the workplace if a system was deployed to monitor the body temperatures of everybody entering the building, according to a separate survey. U.K. concerns Employers in the U.K. say they are not holding back on spending for safety measures. Among the top measures are new hygiene protocols, socially distant layouts and staggered work shifts. Among workers, 45 per cent are hesitant to return to work because they fear they will unknowingly contract COVID-19 and mistakenly pass it to friends and family at home -- despite employers offering extra holidays, free lunches at work and subsidies for commuting costs, found a survey by digital health and therapeutics company Huma. Among safety concerns, employees say interactions with commuters (29 per cent), co-workers (24 per cent) and being in meetings (23 per cent) are the top risk factors to catching COVID-19, found the survey of 5,000 workers and 2,000 employers. Among those who have returned to work, 57 per cent are not confident with the measures in place to ensure their safety and well-being. Two-thirds (67 per cent) of employees would be willing to do a daily symptom check-in with their employers and 71 per cent would be comfortable with employers tracking their symptoms. And while 88 per cent of U.K. employers are comfortable with monitoring and tracking employees' symptoms to ensure a safe workplace environment, they don’t have the means to do it. In the U.S., 86 per cent of employees believe their employer has an obligation to notify employees who may have been in contact with a co-worker who tested positive for COVID-19, according to a separate survey from Kronos.

Canadians somewhat divided on best approach: Survey One in five men say talking politics is appropriate, compared with one in 10 women, finds a survey. By Should people talk politics at work? In typical Canadian style, two-thirds (66 per cent) of workers Aug 25, 2020 Share Should people talk politics at work? In typical Canadian style, two-thirds (66 per cent) of workers cay it may be OK, but it depends on the circumstances. However, 19 per cent of respondents say it is not appropriate while 15 per cent say it is appropriate, found a Robert Half survey. ""While it can be tempting to engage in political discussions in the workplace, it is important for professionals to be respectful of opinions and perspectives that differ from their own,"" says David King, senior district president of Robert Half in Canada. Last year, Google’s clampdown on “disruptive” conversations and the federal election put the issue in spotlight, so employers should think about how they can reinforce what’s appropriate, said one legal expert in talking to Canadian HR Reporter. Canadians are looking for business leaders to take a stance on the issues of equality and racism while the global pandemic rages on and protests against violence against black people around the world continue, according to Angela Carmichael, president at FleishmanHillard HighRoad (FHR) in Toronto. Navigating political talk One in five (21 per cent) men say talking politics is appropriate, compared with one in 10 (nine per cent) women, found the Robert Half survey of 500 adult workers. Also, 19 per cent of working parents say it is appropriate, compared with 12 per cent of professionals without children. ""As many employees continue to work remotely, it is also natural to see a slight rise in social conversations as a way to stay connected with colleagues,"" says King. ""Being considerate in these exchanges is critical to help avoid miscommunication and unnecessary conflict, as these can be catalysts for compromising productivity and morale."" Robert Half shared three tips for navigating political talk with colleagues: Tread lightly: If you choose to participate in political conversations, keep it light and constructive. Should the discussion become confrontational, move onto another subject. Decline politely: Don't feel pressured into sharing your political views. It's OK to bow out of a conversation and let others know you prefer not to chime in. Speak up: If your colleague says or does something that makes you uncomfortable, pull the person aside and explain what's bothering you. For more serious matters, consult your manager or human resources.

By Jim Wilson Sep 03, 2020 Share One in five (20 per cent) of COVID-19 infections among working-age adults in Ontario can be attributed to workplace transmission, according to the Institute for Work & Health (IWH). The institute looked at two sources of information: data from public health officials and the number of compensation claims registered at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) by workers who test positive for COVID-19 and who believe they may have contracted the virus in a workplace setting. “By combining information from Ontario’s public health system and the WSIB, we can build a picture of the incidence of COVID-19 attributed to workplace transmission,” says Cam Mustard, president and senior scientist at IWH. Based on the public health officials’ data, of the 40,000 confirmed cases between March and the first week of August, about 60 per cent or 24,380 occurred among 20- to 59-year-olds. And as of the first week of August, the WSIB was reporting 4,507 allowed compensation claims, 966 not allowed, and 605 pending adjudication. Of the allowed claims, more than 70 per cent are associated with workers in the health-care system, says Mustard. Also, agricultural workers in southwest Ontario experienced the highest occupational transmission in the June to July period. “As health-care workplaces have increased access to required personal protective equipment and gained experience in safely caring for infected patients and residents, we should expect the incidence of infections to decline in this sector,” says Mustard. “Conversely, as more workplaces resume economic activity, we need heightened vigilance to reduce the risk of occupational transmission in all sectors. Poor workplace infection control practices could be an important factor in the size and spread of COVID-19 in the potential second wave. Separate surveys suggest that workers still have safety concerns as they begin to head back to the workplace. Workplace safety According to the federal government, employers can mitigate risks of COVID-19 transmission in their workplace by separating people from each other, reducing contact with shared surfaces and using physical barriers. They can also require their workers to practice cleaning, using personal protective equipment and wearing non-medical masks. In some settings, physical distancing or separation may not be possible so it’s about using a ""layered"" approach, by combining multiple measures, to maximize safety and reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, says the government. Employers must also: communicate openly about COVID-19 and its impact on the workplace, employees and their families encourage employees to take care of their physical and mental health involve occupational health and safety committee or representative to consider workplace risks, PPE as needed and train employees in PPE use In returning to their workplace, Canadian workers say they are keen to have thermal body temperature screening machines installed as a matter of safety, according to a survey.

As a result, many employees found themselves working from home and providing childcare at the same time. As provincial economies reopen and employers encourage employees to return to the physical workplace, the issue of childcare remains as schools, daycares and camps are closed or operating at reduced capacity. Even in jurisdictions in which daycare or camps have reopened or will reopen imminently, some parents may wish to keep their children at home due to fear of exposure to COVID-19. In these circumstances, the question we have been asked is: What are an employer’s legal obligations to accommodate a request for time off, to continue a work-from-home arrangement or to agree to some other arrangement? Step 1: Determine if the employee’s request qualifies for a statutory leave At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Canadian jurisdictions passed legislation to provide an unpaid job-protected leave for an employee who was unable to work for reasons related to COVID-19. This included taking time off to care for a child who was at home due to a school or daycare closure under an emergency order. An employee who requests COVID-19 leave is generally entitled to the same protections available under other statutory leaves, which may include continued recognition of seniority during the leave, continued benefits and the right to be reinstated to the employee’s position or a comparable position if it no longer exists. The COVID-19 leave provisions in the existing legislation do not require an employer to agree to a work-from-home arrangement or any other form of paid accommodation. Further, if schools and daycares reopen, the employee will no longer be entitled to COVID-19 leave, unless the legislation is amended. As such, a request for a continued leave of absence once schools, daycares and camps re-open or for a work-from-home arrangement while schools, daycares and camps remain closed should be addressed as a potential family status accommodation request under human rights legislation. Step 2: Determine if the employee is entitled to accommodation based on family status An employer need only consider a request for accommodation on the basis of family status if the employee has been able to successfully establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The test for establishing prima facie discrimination varies among Canadian jurisdictions. In 2014, the Federal Court of Appeal held that, in order to successfully claim discrimination on the basis of family status, an employee had to demonstrate four things: The child was under the employee’s care and supervision. The childcare obligation engaged a legal responsibility for the child, as opposed to a personal choice. The employee had first made reasonable efforts to self-accommodate. The impugned workplace rule interfered with the fulfilment of the childcare obligation in a way that was more than trivial or insubstantial. This test applies to any federally regulated employer. Ontario and Alberta have rejected this approach in favour of a test that does not directly distinguish between an employee’s needs and wants (preferences), does not require the employee to first self-accommodate and does not require the workplace rule to have interfered in more than a trivial or insubstantial way. In Ontario and Alberta, an employee must only demonstrate three things: Membership in a protected group (in this case, family status). Adverse treatment. The protected ground of discrimination was a factor in the adverse treatment. Arguably, this is an easier standard to meet than the standard for federally regulated employees. However, in Ontario, adjudicators have addressed this by acknowledging that not all adverse treatment constitutes discrimination and the treatment must have a “negative impact” that results “in real disadvantage to the parent/child relationship and the responsibilities that flow from that relationship, and/or to the employee’s work.” To this end, it is appropriate to consider other supports available to the employee, but there is no obligation on an employee to first engage in “self-accommodation.” In British Columbia, courts and adjudicators have set a more stringent test, requiring there to be a change in an employee’s existing terms and conditions of employment that results in serious interference with the discharge of a substantial parental obligation. Regardless of which test is applied, in most cases, an employee who has the option of sending their child to school, camp or daycare during work hours and elects not to do so may have considerable difficulty successfully establishing prima facie discrimination. Under the federal test, the obligation to exhaust “self-accommodation” would include sending the child to school, camp or daycare. In Ontario and Alberta, an employee may not be able to successfully establish “adverse treatment” if the request for accommodation is tied to an employee’s personal choice. In British Columbia, unless there has been a change to the employee’s terms and conditions of employment (for example, to attend work during regular working hours), it will be difficult to establish a prima facie case of family status discrimination. The duty to accommodate may still be engaged (outside of British Columbia) if: (1) schools, daycares and camps remain closed and an employee wants to continue to work from home (rather than take an unpaid leave) even after being asked to return to the physical workplace, or (2) if schools, daycares and camps open on a limited basis and an employee requests a schedule modification or partial work-from-home arrangement to reflect the amended hours. If the duty to accommodate is triggered, an employer must determine whether the request for accommodation can be accommodated without causing undue hardship on the employer. Step 3: Determine whether the employee can be accommodated without undue hardship to the employer Accommodation is an individualized assessment. For some positions, a work-from-home arrangement is easily accomplished. For many others, a work-from-home arrangement is not feasible because the work requires tools or resources available only in the physical workplace (for example, manufacturing, sanitation or construction). Similarly, work from home is not a realistic option for an employee who serves customers directly in the workplace (for example, hospitality). Even if the work can be performed at home, an employer will want to evaluate how and to what extent this can be done effectively if the employee is also providing childcare. If the answer is not clear, accommodation can be provided on a temporary basis to allow the employer to evaluate the situation. Furthermore, the fact that a work-from-home arrangement may have been tolerable on a temporary basis under an emergency order does not mean that it would not result in undue hardship if the arrangement was indefinite. In other words, an arrangement that was tolerable in an emergency may not be so in the long term, particularly if the arrangement resulted in a situation in which the employee was unable to perform key duties.

By Jim Wilson Sep 03, 2020 Share One in five (20 per cent) of COVID-19 infections among working-age adults in Ontario can be attributed to workplace transmission, according to the Institute for Work & Health (IWH). The institute looked at two sources of information: data from public health officials and the number of compensation claims registered at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) by workers who test positive for COVID-19 and who believe they may have contracted the virus in a workplace setting. “By combining information from Ontario’s public health system and the WSIB, we can build a picture of the incidence of COVID-19 attributed to workplace transmission,” says Cam Mustard, president and senior scientist at IWH. Based on the public health officials’ data, of the 40,000 confirmed cases between March and the first week of August, about 60 per cent or 24,380 occurred among 20- to 59-year-olds. And as of the first week of August, the WSIB was reporting 4,507 allowed compensation claims, 966 not allowed, and 605 pending adjudication. Of the allowed claims, more than 70 per cent are associated with workers in the health-care system, says Mustard. Also, agricultural workers in southwest Ontario experienced the highest occupational transmission in the June to July period. “As health-care workplaces have increased access to required personal protective equipment and gained experience in safely caring for infected patients and residents, we should expect the incidence of infections to decline in this sector,” says Mustard. “Conversely, as more workplaces resume economic activity, we need heightened vigilance to reduce the risk of occupational transmission in all sectors. Poor workplace infection control practices could be an important factor in the size and spread of COVID-19 in the potential second wave. Separate surveys suggest that workers still have safety concerns as they begin to head back to the workplace. Workplace safety According to the federal government, employers can mitigate risks of COVID-19 transmission in their workplace by separating people from each other, reducing contact with shared surfaces and using physical barriers. They can also require their workers to practice cleaning, using personal protective equipment and wearing non-medical masks. In some settings, physical distancing or separation may not be possible so it’s about using a ""layered"" approach, by combining multiple measures, to maximize safety and reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, says the government. Employers must also: communicate openly about COVID-19 and its impact on the workplace, employees and their families encourage employees to take care of their physical and mental health involve occupational health and safety committee or representative to consider workplace risks, PPE as needed and train employees in PPE use In returning to their workplace, Canadian workers say they are keen to have thermal body temperature screening machines installed as a matter of safety, according to a survey.

As a result, many employees found themselves working from home and providing childcare at the same time. As provincial economies reopen and employers encourage employees to return to the physical workplace, the issue of childcare remains as schools, daycares and camps are closed or operating at reduced capacity. Even in jurisdictions in which daycare or camps have reopened or will reopen imminently, some parents may wish to keep their children at home due to fear of exposure to COVID-19. In these circumstances, the question we have been asked is: What are an employer’s legal obligations to accommodate a request for time off, to continue a work-from-home arrangement or to agree to some other arrangement? Step 1: Determine if the employee’s request qualifies for a statutory leave At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Canadian jurisdictions passed legislation to provide an unpaid job-protected leave for an employee who was unable to work for reasons related to COVID-19. This included taking time off to care for a child who was at home due to a school or daycare closure under an emergency order. An employee who requests COVID-19 leave is generally entitled to the same protections available under other statutory leaves, which may include continued recognition of seniority during the leave, continued benefits and the right to be reinstated to the employee’s position or a comparable position if it no longer exists. The COVID-19 leave provisions in the existing legislation do not require an employer to agree to a work-from-home arrangement or any other form of paid accommodation. Further, if schools and daycares reopen, the employee will no longer be entitled to COVID-19 leave, unless the legislation is amended. As such, a request for a continued leave of absence once schools, daycares and camps re-open or for a work-from-home arrangement while schools, daycares and camps remain closed should be addressed as a potential family status accommodation request under human rights legislation. Step 2: Determine if the employee is entitled to accommodation based on family status An employer need only consider a request for accommodation on the basis of family status if the employee has been able to successfully establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The test for establishing prima facie discrimination varies among Canadian jurisdictions. In 2014, the Federal Court of Appeal held that, in order to successfully claim discrimination on the basis of family status, an employee had to demonstrate four things: The child was under the employee’s care and supervision. The childcare obligation engaged a legal responsibility for the child, as opposed to a personal choice. The employee had first made reasonable efforts to self-accommodate. The impugned workplace rule interfered with the fulfilment of the childcare obligation in a way that was more than trivial or insubstantial. This test applies to any federally regulated employer. Ontario and Alberta have rejected this approach in favour of a test that does not directly distinguish between an employee’s needs and wants (preferences), does not require the employee to first self-accommodate and does not require the workplace rule to have interfered in more than a trivial or insubstantial way. In Ontario and Alberta, an employee must only demonstrate three things: Membership in a protected group (in this case, family status). Adverse treatment. The protected ground of discrimination was a factor in the adverse treatment. Arguably, this is an easier standard to meet than the standard for federally regulated employees. However, in Ontario, adjudicators have addressed this by acknowledging that not all adverse treatment constitutes discrimination and the treatment must have a “negative impact” that results “in real disadvantage to the parent/child relationship and the responsibilities that flow from that relationship, and/or to the employee’s work.” To this end, it is appropriate to consider other supports available to the employee, but there is no obligation on an employee to first engage in “self-accommodation.” In British Columbia, courts and adjudicators have set a more stringent test, requiring there to be a change in an employee’s existing terms and conditions of employment that results in serious interference with the discharge of a substantial parental obligation. Regardless of which test is applied, in most cases, an employee who has the option of sending their child to school, camp or daycare during work hours and elects not to do so may have considerable difficulty successfully establishing prima facie discrimination. Under the federal test, the obligation to exhaust “self-accommodation” would include sending the child to school, camp or daycare. In Ontario and Alberta, an employee may not be able to successfully establish “adverse treatment” if the request for accommodation is tied to an employee’s personal choice. In British Columbia, unless there has been a change to the employee’s terms and conditions of employment (for example, to attend work during regular working hours), it will be difficult to establish a prima facie case of family status discrimination. The duty to accommodate may still be engaged (outside of British Columbia) if: (1) schools, daycares and camps remain closed and an employee wants to continue to work from home (rather than take an unpaid leave) even after being asked to return to the physical workplace, or (2) if schools, daycares and camps open on a limited basis and an employee requests a schedule modification or partial work-from-home arrangement to reflect the amended hours. If the duty to accommodate is triggered, an employer must determine whether the request for accommodation can be accommodated without causing undue hardship on the employer. Step 3: Determine whether the employee can be accommodated without undue hardship to the employer Accommodation is an individualized assessment. For some positions, a work-from-home arrangement is easily accomplished. For many others, a work-from-home arrangement is not feasible because the work requires tools or resources available only in the physical workplace (for example, manufacturing, sanitation or construction). Similarly, work from home is not a realistic option for an employee who serves customers directly in the workplace (for example, hospitality). Even if the work can be performed at home, an employer will want to evaluate how and to what extent this can be done effectively if the employee is also providing childcare. If the answer is not clear, accommodation can be provided on a temporary basis to allow the employer to evaluate the situation. Furthermore, the fact that a work-from-home arrangement may have been tolerable on a temporary basis under an emergency order does not mean that it would not result in undue hardship if the arrangement was indefinite. In other words, an arrangement that was tolerable in an emergency may not be so in the long term, particularly if the arrangement resulted in a situation in which the employee was unable to perform key duties.

What happens with quarantines? By John Dujay Sep 21, 2020 Share Now that many more businesses are allowing employees to shuffle back into the workplace as the economy reopens, organizations are having to grapple with new issues, such as travel. Canadian HR Reporter asked Kiljon Shukullari, team lead advice team at HR consultancy Peninsula Canada in Toronto, about what items an employer should consider when it comes to employees travelling for business and pleasure. Q: What should an employer consider before sending an employee on a business trip? A: “If you’re thinking of travelling down to the U.S. or Europe, you have to consider how the travel will be affected for these individuals, how much risk they’re being exposed to. A lot of employers are taking a very cautious approach at the moment, even when it comes to returning to the office, never mind with actual travel. But if required, you have to do a really in-depth risk assessment from the moment the person leaves to their destination and precautions they need to take. “[Keep] in mind any risks associated with existing medical conditions that the individual might have, as it relates to themselves, their family members, their ability to self-quarantine if they’re required to upon return, because returning from anywhere to Canada, most of the time, you have to self-quarantine.” Q: Are there any reasons not to consider business travel right now? A: “Anyone that is not supposed to, for essential reasons, take that trip should not be sent by the employer if you can conduct business over video. It’s available everywhere, a lot of the infrastructure has been improved. A lot of the companies were already on their journey to digitize the way they operate, and they communicate amongst themselves and their clients, so B2C and B2B has been improved to the max at this point. “The question should be thrown back at the business owners to understand if they are really needing to send someone to travel instead of trying to figure out how best they can approach whatever scenario they’re trying to resolve through remote access. “A lot of the business meetings, if they have to happen, even at a local level, they’re being held in areas that are in an open environment. If you have to come to a particular office, then you’d have to have very clear guidelines in place as to how you access it with all the rules that have been specified by the health authorities.” Q: Can an employer restrict an employee’s personal travel plans? A: “The simple answer, in general terms, is never; the reason for that is because whatever the employee does in their personal life due to privacy is something that they do not necessarily have to share with you. “However, [it’s important to have] open communication nowadays and empathy with what everyone’s needs are to undertake travel. Open communication is key during this time and shared responsibility needs to be communicated. “Ultimately, it’s the employer’s responsibility to assure a safe work environment for everyone in their office... Individuals that are to come to the office, who don’t have any option of working from home, need to understand that there’s going to be delay in how they will be brought back to the office, should they undertake any travel in areas that are still exposed to certain risks. Kiljon Shukullari “You would be subject to quarantine so the company will have to respect that. As long as everybody’s on the same page… you’re trying to avoid surprises.” Q: What should be done when an employee returns from abroad? A: “They should follow the rules of self-checking, identifying any symptoms and anything that they might have… If it turns out that the employee has travelled abroad, they should be self-isolating. “The employer and the employee should be in touch at all times to identify if there’s any need to extend or reduce the self-isolation. In all scenarios, open communication is the key because what you want to avoid is someone bypassing all these guidelines and coming to the office and putting everybody in jeopardy -- nothing should be taken lightly. “If you really feel sick, you should not be in the office and this should be identified before. That’s why contact information, either phone or email or nowadays, even text, those should be readily available to the employees at any time. And they should be followed up then by the health and safety team.” Q: What should happen if an employee goes into quarantine? A: “If you’ve been ordered to quarantine, there will not be any requirement from the employer in general terms to pay you, however every company, every policy that they have might differ when it comes to these types of leaves, and the employees might have access to certain paid days. “If they do — some companies call them flex days, some companies call them sick days — they could claim access to those. There’s a lot of options when it comes to the employees going on leave. Some businesses even let them access their accrued vacation pay, but that’s an option as well.” Canadian HR Reporter has also talked to experts when it comes to legal questions on recruiting, retaining remote workers and key considerations on the return to the workplace.

By John Dujay Sep 30, 2020 Share Employees are going back into workplaces, albeit slowly, leaving employers wondering about how best to manage it safely. But what happens if an employee falls ill after returning to the workplace? Is the employer liable? What role does the employee play? Canadian HR Reporter asked Ashu Ismail, personal injury lawyer at Campisi Personal Injury Lawyers in Toronto, for answers to these questions and more. Q: What steps should an employer take before allowing a return to the workplace? A: “If there’s a health and safety committee, depending on the size of your organization, it should probably be created or at least an individual [should become] responsible. Every work area needs to be inspected for its distance between other work areas. “Generally what’s happened is what’s called the ‘standard of care:’ barriers can be between workstations; there should be rules around masks; there should be available and accessible the ability to wash hands frequently or the ability to sanitize; there should be frequent flushing of high-contact surface areas; there should be limits of crowds. “Somebody should be walking around the office ensuring that it’s as safe as possible, that people know there are safety protocols in place and that they’re required to follow those safety protocols.” Q: How should employees stay safe? A: “It’s most important for employees to take it upon themselves to ensure that when they’re out in the community, they’re being safe [so] if they’re grocery shopping, they’re wearing a mask. I don’t think other employees would appreciate if they were in close quarters [with people] and breaking all kinds of rules, either in restaurants, bars or large gatherings. But if they, are then absolutely isolate, and if you come into the office, hopefully you have your own space with a door that can shut. “If an employee believes that they have any symptoms, they should get tested, and let their employer know that they’re staying home until the test results come back and isolate. The burden on employees becomes even more difficult when their kids are going to school. But being as careful as possible, I believe is an obligation that we all share.” Q: Is an employer liable if an employee becomes sick once they return to the workplace? A: “Workplaces and employers have an obligation to keep the people in their workplace safe, so they only become liable when they fail in their responsibility to make efforts within their workplace. The efforts they would be making would be along the lines as set out by the Ministry of Labour, and following the Occupational Health and Safety Act. “If an employer is doing absolutely nothing, and they’re demanding that people come in, they work in close quarters, and you can prove that the transmission occurred — and that’s a difficult part — you need to be able to prove that transmission occurred within those circumstances or at least more than likely occurred within that circumstance. Then you could have a situation where an employer can be liable. “A second scenario is where you have an individual worker who is not following any rules or guidelines, is known to be partying every weekend in close quarters with tons of strangers, catches the virus and then comes into the workplace and shares it with everyone else. So long as you can prove that individual has subjected themselves to a personal liability and the employer, in so far as they know, that worker’s contact may also attract some vicarious liability.” Ashu Ismail Q: What happens if an employee knows someone who contracted COVID? A: “Absolutely require sign-off from a physician: I would prefer to go further than just a test result, I would actually want the person’s treating physician to confirm as well that there’s no chance or possibility or risk of spread. That’s number one, because you want to make sure that no one we know is coming into the work environment who has the possibility of spreading it, otherwise let them work at home or find something else.” Q: What are the rules around an unsafe workplace? A: “The employee has the right, absolutely, to let the employer know that they feel like they’re in an unsafe work environment and to set out what those issues are. They have the right to refuse to work on their reasonable belief that it’s unsafe... The employer should absolutely address the concerns. “When you deal with a tort claim in terms of an employer’s responsibility, it’s always the time: Somebody who experienced the transmission incident in late February 2020 is going to be different from the case of someone who’s experienced a transmission event in March, and even different than in April; but in late September 2020, we know you have to keep people apart, you have to protect the transmission of airborne and you have to clean surface areas frequently.” Q: With COVID, when is it considered a personal injury versus an employment law matter? A: “The employment law matters can arise almost instantaneously if someone feels the place is unsafe and they refuse to work and they’re having problems with their boss around when [they] have to come in, where [they] work and is it safe? Perhaps that person then doesn’t want to work or perhaps that person is pushed out. Those are definitely employment law matters. “The personal injury part of it begins when you start to experience stress, emotional stress, anxiety: that we call aggravated damages in the employment relationship where they do have a good faith, your employer does, to manage the situation. It can begin with a stress or anxiety and then it can certainly come to life in the event that someone becomes ill and they can show proof that transmission occurred in the workplace as a result of the failure to take care of the workplace in the manner required, or believed to be required. “Then you have a mash-up of both an employment-law situation and a personal-injury situation.” Canadian HR Reporter has also talked to legal experts when it comes to employees travelling on business and how best to manage a safe return to work.

Survey says 40 per cent are keen to return – but anxiety is an issue Two thirds of Canadian decision-makers say they are planning to immediately require all people to wear masks at all times in the workplace. By Jim Wilson Sep 15, 2020 Share An average of 40 per cent of employees currently teleworking wants to return to the workplace. So say Canadian decision-makers in responding to a survey about working amid the pandemic. Close to four in 10 (37 per cent) of the respondents say they expect all their employees to return to working at their physical location rather than working remotely in the first half of 2021. That compares to 27 per cent for the fall of this year and 13 per cent for the second half of 2021. Close to eight in 10 (79 per cent) say that flexible working (sometimes from the office, sometimes from home) will be a permanent change at their company, found the survey released by Get Working, a product by software company Foko Retail. ""We know businesses will transition to flexible working permanently and that the use of workspace needs to be properly documented for contact tracing purposes. We also know there is a need to remotely test employees before they even enter the office,” says Gingras. “The question is how do companies manage capacity, contact tracing, and health and safety in a meaningful way that supports the needs of workers and employers alike."" Fifty per cent of decision-makers think their company will not be downsizing but will change the type of space they have in the next two years. For the 22 per cent who think their company will downsize its space, it’s estimated they’d looking to reduce space by an average of 34 per cent. Asked if they are planning to limit the number of employees who can come to the office, 68 per cent report yes, immediately, while 19 per cent report yes, in the future, and 13 per cent report they have no plan to do so/it’s not necessary. Anxiety issues around safety However, 79 per cent of respondents say that they sense anxiety among their team around coming back to the workplace in-person. Matching the sentiments of many Canadians, employees in the U.S. and U.K. have strong concerns about returning to the workplace, citing safety risks amid the pandemic. And half of the decisionmakers say that they are finding it awkward to communicate with their team about the return to the office, finds the Get Working survey of 435 decision-makers in Canadian companies between Aug. 4 and Aug. 12, 2020. In rating a number of potential safety procedures on their level of difficulty to implement, enforcing social distancing (6.3 out of 10) and convincing employees it’s safe to return to work (6.2 out of 10) came out on top. The biggest concern about having employees return is ensuring the safety of the working environment and that proper safety procedures are in place (22 per cent), followed by possible exposure/bringing COVID-19 into the workplace (21 per cent) and maintaining social distancing (17 per cent), finds Get Working. Two thirds of decision-makers (66 per cent) say they are planning to immediately require all people to wear masks at all times in the workplace, while 19 per cent say they have no plan to do so/it’s not necessary, and 15 per cent say yes, in the future. Just under six in ten decision-makers (59 per cent) say they are planning to immediately stop sharing tools such as computers and machines among employees, while 23 per cent report yes, in the future, and 18 per cent report they have no plan to do so/it’s not necessary. One in five (20 per cent) of COVID-19 infections among working-age adults in Ontario can be attributed to workplace transmission, according to data from the Institute for Work & Health (IWH) released earlier this month. Mitigating the risks Employers can mitigate the risk of spreading COVID-19 in the workplace by doing the following, according to the federal government: Discourage people who are ill from entering the workplace or business. Promote and facilitate personal preventive practices. Promote physical distancing. Create physical barriers between employees or clients when physical distancing is not possible. Increase ventilation. Mitigate risks from exposure to high-touch surfaces Mitigate risk for people at higher risk of severe illness. Modify practices to reduce how long employees or clients are in contact with each other and how many employees/clients come into contact with each other.

Canadian HR Reporter spoke with Shaun Parker, employment and labour associate at Osler in Calgary, about some of the issues organizations should keep in mind. Q: Can workers be mandated to take the COVID-19 vaccine? A: “I’d be very reticent to counsel any employer to mandate vaccination for their employees and the reason is it opens up a whole host of issues with human rights considerations, as well as privacy law implications. It’s a very thorny issue. Absent clear government direction that this should be mandated, I’d be very slow to do it in most workplaces.” Q: Should employers request proof of having taken the vaccine? A: “Short answer is, yes. An employer can and it should but the key thing for employers is you build this into the employer’s COVID-19 policies and protocols. You don’t want to just be requesting proof of vaccination willy-nilly; you want it to serve a purpose. “For example, we’ve seen it before in the case law in the health-care sector where nurses, for instance, have had the choice between taking a flu shot or if they refuse, then they have to wear a mask at work. I don’t know if that translates into COVID the same way but that could be an example of how you use a vaccination with your COVID-19 protocols. “There may be breaks cut to employees who have chosen to be vaccinated or they may get some quicker back-to-normal treatments than employees who choose not to do that. Shaun Parker “If the medical evidence supports that people who have been vaccinated, for instance, don’t need to follow the same sort of social distancing protocols… those people perhaps [may] start getting exempted from the otherwise more rigid protocols an employer has.” Q: What happens if employees refuse to vaccinate or disclose if they have taken it? A: “It’s going to depend heavily on how the employer’s COVID-19 policies are set up, as well as the nature of the workplace. My general caution to employers is ‘There’s not even a vaccine out in Canada yet but be very careful about taking too aggressive an approach early on.’ “I could see… for the first few months of the vaccine’s roll-out, generally, an employer would want to take things slow. Cut to a year from now, after the vaccine is generally available, that may materially change an employer’s position to where they can push harder. “You can’t force people to take the vaccine but there may be a time and place where — and depending on the nature of the industry — an employer can’t accommodate employees who are refusing to be vaccinated based on medical evidence, or medical considerations. We don’t know what that looks like now, so ‘Take it slow’ is my counsel.” Q: Would the issue matter more for certain professions? A: “Absolutely. Certainly, where we’re going to see these battles first arise is in the health-care sector: hospital workers, where there’s a care facility -- those industries have been the one to adopt, historically, mandatory flu vaccinations or who have really pushed the flu vaccinations. It’s going to be similar with COVID, just because you’re dealing with populations and employees who are most at risk. “I could also see it spilling over into the airline industry perhaps, especially as international air travel resurfaces and starts getting going again. That’s where the fights are going to happen immediately, and we’re going to see some of this played out. “For employers and other industries, [they should] watch and learn with those experiences, and they may save themselves a headache and some costly legal battle.” Q: Should employers offer vaccines at work? A: “As long as the employer can get the vaccine, similar to the flu shot, absolutely. We’ve started getting some questions on this from clients but, thinking ahead, treat it like you would with your annual flu program. “If you can get the vaccine, and you can make it available to your employees, roll it out with an information program extolling the benefits the same way an employer might with its annual flu program.” “If the medical evidence supports that people who have been vaccinated, for instance, don’t need to follow the same sort of social distancing protocols… those people perhaps start getting exempted from the otherwise more rigid protocols an employer has.” Q: Who should administer the vaccinations? A: “Look to the medical authorities, and specifically what guidance they have. My suspicion is it’s going to have to be a nurse of some sort, or perhaps somebody with some sort of medical training, especially if it’s an inoculation. You’re going to want to make sure that it’s a qualified medical practitioner. “You want to have people on the ground ready to deal with accommodation issues, especially as part of this vaccine rollout program; the employer is going to want to keep an eye on people who [object] for religious or disability reasons. [Employers are] going to want to make sure that they not take adverse employment action against people who can’t get vaccinated.

'Once this is over and there’s a vaccine, and people begin to feel safe again, life is going to return to normal’ Several focus group members said the need for humans to be social and connect with each other will be a strong influence on a migration back to office environments. By Jim Wilson Jan 07, 2021 Share One of the surprises of the rise in work from home amid the pandemic is that workers’ productivity has remained strong. However, there’s also a perceived cost in long-term productivity, corporate culture, and innovation and creativity, according to a report from real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield based on a focus group and survey insights from large building owners and business improvement district executive directors in major U.S. markets. “It’s just not sustainable at the levels people have been at to remain productive; it’s going to be at a cost to them [office workers] personally,” says another focus group participant about the whole remote work setup. Work-from-home fatigue Employers also say that employees have expressed a desire to get back to the office to connect and collaborate, and that work-from-home fatigue is increasing. One reason? The expanded use of video conference call technology. “One of the byproducts of working from home is that the number of meetings I have to attend has gone up — and you just can’t pop in. People have to schedule a 30-minute meeting. I’m just worn out from being in meetings on camera all day,” says one of the participants in the focus group. Because of the amount of time spent on video calls, 44 per cent of workers say they’ve experienced video call fatigue since the start of the pandemic, according to another study released in November. In October, a legal analyst was caught masturbating on a Zoom call and was suspended by his employer. Culture concerns Many employers have built up cultural capital over the past few years through interpersonal relationships, trust, shared history, vision buy-in and more, says the report. “Organizations have leveraged this reservoir of cultural capital to help manage through change and crisis in 2020. Leaders fear, however, that capital will erode over time if people do not return to face-to-face interactions.” Several focus group members said the need for humans to be social and connect with each other will be a strong influence on a migration back to office environments. “People have really short memories. So, once this is finally over and there’s a vaccine, and people begin to feel safe again, I think that life is going to return to normal,” said one. While it’s easy when everyone has gone remote amid the pandemic, once people go back into the office, “it will be a much different experience for someone connecting virtually to a session in the future where all other participants are together in the same conference room,” says the report. A previous study found that real estate professionals continue to see a key role for physical office space in creating a corporate culture (96 per cent) and recruiting and retaining employees (93 per cent). Location When it comes to office location, the consensus among investors, occupiers and placemakers is that location strategy was not likely to change significantly in the wake of the pandemic, says the Cushman & Wakefield report. “People are going to want to be in the middle of everything, where you can walk to your amenities, your dining, live, work, play, and be there,” says one focus group participant. Previously, a TELUS International survey found that small talk and interacting with colleagues (57 per cent) are what employees miss the most while working remotely.

By John Dujay Jan 11, 2021 Share In an effort to address the ongoing wage gap in federally regulated employers, new measures that went into effect on Jan. 1, will provide a more fulsome look at exactly how much those employees are getting paid. As a part of amendments made to the Employment Equity Act, businesses with more than 100 employees will be mandated to provide more detailed salary data that will be made public beginning in 2022, says a Toronto employment lawyer. As part of the government’s pay transparency measures, “these are part of a broader approach by the government to be addressing issues around equity and inclusion in the workplace,” says Jennifer Hodgins, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright Canada in Toronto. At the heart of the changes will be new methods of defining salary, she says. “The new definitions will be in the legislation, as well: as the period over which the salary was paid; the number of hours worked that can be attributed to the salary earned; the bonus amounts paid during the reporting period; as well as overtime paid and the corresponding overtime hours worked.” But the new regulations should not be too onerous for employers, says Hodgins, as many have been reporting data to the federal government for some time. “My understanding is that part of the motivation behind some of these changes, for example, to the definition of salary is to actually ease the burden on employers, and make it so that what employers need to report is more consistent with what they internally are recording about their employees’ salary.” Jennifer Hodgins Once the data has been collected, it will be made public, according to Hodgins. “The government will ultimately take that information around wage gaps, aggregate it and release it as part of a government report on the issue of wage gaps in federally regulated workplaces.” HR’s role For HR professionals, it’s important to take a look at the new salary data that they’ll be needing to include in the report, she says. “While these amendments came into force on Jan. 1, employers will only be required to include this new salary data in in the reporting as part of their June 1, 2022 report, which will capture the 2021 calendar year. The report that they’re going to be filing this year in 2021 will be based on the current requirements for salary reporting.” And HR professionals should be aware that reporting questionnaires — which help employers understand just who employees identify as — will have to be altered slightly, according to Hodgins. “Previously, employers were required to include definitions in a self-workplace questionnaire that were consistent with the act; employers who have to provide questionnaires to employees to self-identify as members of the designated groups under the act now have to actually include the definitions in the act.” The four designated groups are women, Indigenous people, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities. Legislation has also been changed around harassment in the workplace and the federal government is looking for some input into planned Privacy Act changes. Latest stories WFH?

By Jim Wilson Feb 02, 2021 Share Nearly half (45 per cent) of women experiencing sexual harassment say it happens remotely, according to a report. This can include: sexual messages, such as email, texts or social media posts; cyber harassment such as Zoom, Teams or Slack; and sexual calls. And 23 per cent of women who have experienced harassment say it has increased since they started working from home in March, and 15 per cent report an increase in online harassment whilst working from home during the COVID-19, found a survey of women in the United Kingdom and Wales by the charity Rights of Women. “These statistics echo what women have been telling us already: Sexual harassment at work happens online as well as in-person,” says Deeba Syed, senior legal officer at Rights of Women. “Women continue to suffer sexual harassment despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Women working from home have seen their harassers take to Zoom, Microsoft Teams, social media, messages, and phone calls, to continue the torrent of abuse.” Are employers doing enough? More than seven in 10 (72 per cent) of women experiencing sexual harassment at work do not feel their employer is doing enough to protect or support them from the harassment and abuse, finds the survey of 336 women. And 29 per cent of women who have reported sexual harassment to their employer say that the response has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as in-person restrictions and communication delays. Women’s health and safety from sexual harassment at work is being undermined and overlooked by their employers, says Syed. “Women have told us that employers are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to delay and frustrate the justice processes for women who do come forward to report harassment. In doing so, they continue to neglect their legal responsibility to prevent and protect women from sexual harassment at work.” Employers are still getting in trouble when it comes to harassment, as seen in two Ontario cases: One involving the former supervisor at an Ontario group home and another an Ontario car dealership. ‘Perfect storm’ of conditions Remote workplaces or those that are decentralized “truly have the perfect storm of harassment conditions,” say two experts at tech company EVERFI: Elizabeth Bille, senior vice president of workplace culture, and Holly Rider-Milkovich, vice president of impact and education. They cite the following conditions: Increased employee stress and fatigue due to COVID-19 Decreased formality and civility in online environments Lack of in-person witnesses in remote workspaces Challenges in monitoring remote employee conduct Lack of information about how supervisors should address online behavior However, there are things that managers can do to address the issue, say Bille and Rider-Milkovich. For one, managers should also set a clear expectation that the same anti-harassment policies and guidelines for professional behaviour in-person also apply in the remote environment “[That includes] thinking carefully before making comments about a person’s appearance or their home, making jokes about being in bed while working or sharing inappropriate memes. These can seem harmless, but they can make individuals uncomfortable and can also lead to even more egregious behaviour if allowed to pass unchecked.""

By Jim Wilson Feb 25, 2021 Share The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on employment in all industries, but the tourism sector has been dealt a worse card than many. “The reality is the industry took a very, very large hit, very early. And we do know it’s going to take a long time to recover, longer than the economy overall,” says Philip Mondor, CEO of Tourism HR Canada. “Once it was announced that there was a global pandemic, we lost about a third of our workforce or 880,000 workers within 10 weeks. And still today, we are short of about 500,000 of those workers. So you can anticipate that there’s been a lot of impact as a result of all these displaced people and what it means in terms of their jobs and the businesses.” But employers in the tourism industry have not left these workers out to dry, according to Mondor. “For some who were furloughed or were not in their jobs anymore, most of the things that businesses did are to get in touch with them and to provide supports. In recent months, it’s been much more around mental health supports and attaching them to resources to help with issues of that type.”. Back in June, Mondor said the tourism industry would have to reform entire HR strategies and plans to cope with the economic changes. Changing roles Those who have managed to stay on with their employers have had to deal with a lot of changes in the workplace. “It’s the people that were doing the interactions with the consumers or the clients, face to face interactions. Those jobs have been most impacted in terms of how protocols have changed for them. They can’t just do their work in certain ways. They have to find ways on how things might be done still in a customer-interfacing scenario,” he says. “Some of them have managed to provide services in a PPE environment, they can wear different garb and manage things… They have new protocols and so they’re adjusting to those protocols and the volume of the business they do and the way they do things have changed.” Philip Mondor A good number of workers have been tasked with different kinds of work that they’re not familiar with. For example, they’re helping redefine business models, says Mondor. “Since they know the businesses so well, they’ve been asked to work on things like finding new markets and doing research on what those markets look like, and helping develop new products, new services, new marketing strategies [that are] no longer customer-interfacing,” he says. “They are repurposing their knowledge but putting [that] into new types of jobs, new tasks that are helping the businesses innovate what they are doing.” There’s a huge opportunity for HR in upskilling the workforce, say experts. However, it requires consultations, says Mondor. “It’s a process that involves working very closely with the worker to help them make decisions on the type of work they like to take on or how they want to change into something different. So it’s unique for everybody, they’re not just assigned new roles. It’s a process that involves consultation with the worker and giving them an opportunity to make decisions on what their professional track will look like, and how they will adapt to these new roles.” It also involves providing training and the right kinds of support. For example, if people moved into digital marketing, “they learn more about how to use the technology, they are given skills on how to build new marketing strategies that involve adoption like how to use social media, how to start connecting with consumers through virtual means,” he says. With the pandemic, important for employers to consider recalibrating their entire business models, says Mondor. “[They shouldn’t] think about what they used to be but think about where they need to go. And get grounded in looking at what their business needs to look like going forward. It could be far different on what it was [so] focus on what’s doable, not what it was.” More than eight in 10 (82 per cent) employers did not list pandemics or other major health crises among the top 10 risks on their risk registers before the COVID-19 crisis, according to Aon.

By Jim Wilson Mar 05, 2021 Share Even though 60 per cent of Canadians are having mental health issues, more than half (54 per cent) have not sought medical support, according to a survey by Sun Life. Why? Many people feel they don't need medical help (31 per cent) while 25 per cent say they can't afford it and 23 per cent are embarrassed to ask for help. Slightly more women (62 per cent) than men (56 per cent) are experiencing mental health troubles. And among age groups, gen Z and millennials (both 74 per cent) are the most affected, followed by 40- to 55-year-olds (64 per cent) and baby boomers (40 per cent), finds the survey of 1,000 Canadians in January. Eleven per cent more antidepressants were filled last year, according to a separate report. Addiction challenges Seven per cent of Canadians list addiction as a mental health issue. While the numbers are similar for men (eight per cent) and women (six per cent) respondents, addiction is proving to be a problem for gen Z (16 per cent) and millennials (12 per cent). Forty to 55-year-olds (five per cent) and those aged 56 and up (two per cent) have lower numbers, finds the Sun Life survey. Many Canadians who consume alcohol or cannabis are indulging more during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a separate survey.

By John Dujay Jul 13, 2020 Share The level of prescriptions for mental health concerns rose sharply in the first half of the year for one benefits provider as the world suffered through the COVID-19 pandemic. Eleven per cent more antidepressants were filled between January and June, versus last year’s numbers, finds Express Scripts Canada, a Mississauga, Ont.-based organization. “To give you some context, the previous year was basically flat: From 2018 to 2019, it was 0.1 per cent when it went up,” says Dorian Lo, president. “Now, to see a double-digit increase, that is definitely significant.” This translates to 61 per cent of total claims volume reached by June 30. Depression ranked fifth out of the top 10 therapeutic classes in total claim cost (overall spend), according to Express Scripts. “The big takeaway is that Canadians are feeling the stress from the COVID, and we’re seeing quite a jump in the number of claimants,” says Lo. Asthma, COPD meds also rise In addition to mental health concerns, medications for asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) represented the largest change in claims volume so far in 2020, which is understandable during the coronavirus outbreak, says Lo. “We know that asthma patients are at greater risk, and certainly there was a lot of uncertainty and that’s why some control measures were put in place to limit the day supply and the pharmacy industry was able to successfully negotiate it so that all Canadians had enough medication.” The prescribing of anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine rose in terms of volume early, but that has now waned, he says. “Now we see that completely moderate; the medical community in Canada would agree that these antimalarials do not work for COVID and we’re seeing things return back to the baseline levels before COVID.” Early on, there was concern about certain drugs running out but that concern has now dissipated, according to Lo. “They feel confident that we will be able to have sufficient supply in Canada. They’re not foreseeing any shortages. Of course, it is dependent on the world getting COVID under reasonable control, so that the global supply chain can work. But I think in many countries, we are seeing that happen.” “They’re not putting up any red flags and that’s one of the reasons why the Canadian pharmacies have moved from restricting in some provinces to 30 days to reopening it back up to normal, which would be 90 days,” he says. Takeaways for HR For HR departments, it’s important to “make sure that all employees are engaged because seeing employee become disengaged could be a warning signal for depression,” says Lo. “One of the messages to give to the senior leaders is expect that mental health illness is going to increase. If you see performance decreasing in one of your employees, don’t necessarily think that they’re not trying -- also think that they may be getting depressed because certainly reduced performance at work is one of the key signs of depression. It’s important for HR professionals to be vigilant: it’s really, really hard to check on your employees, if you have a significant base at work at home,” he says. Dorian Lo One thing that could also be considered as part of a prudent medical plan for home-based employees to help alleviate mental health problems is behavioural therapy, he says. “Covering that should be a strong consideration as it’s well proven. Obviously, people have difficulty accessing their psychologist or psychiatrist or family doctor and so something like online cognitive behavioural therapy and covering that would be something to strongly consider.” The cost of benefits probably won’t surge post-COVID, according to one broker, but some employers are being overcharged for benefits that weren’t being used, found a benefits adviser.

And while many employers are aware of the problem, they’re not necessarily responding, according to a recent survey. Nearly half (47 per cent) of Canadian employers say they are worried about employee burnout, and among businesses hurt by the pandemic, 42 per cent believe dampened employee morale and a potential increase of burnout will negatively impact their revenues for the remainder of 2021, according to a report from Sage. However, nearly seven in 10 (68 per cent) of employers have not taken action to address this issue, finds the survey of 1,569 Canadian workers and 775 business decision-makers in organizations with 50 to 499 employees, conducted in March. Meanwhile, one in three employees (32 per cent) are concerned about burnout affecting their ability to do their job. And half of working Canadians feel exhausted and stressed, according to another report. ""The past year has been a difficult time for many businesses across Canada to navigate, but we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Nancy Tichbon, managing director at Sage Canada. ""While there are some external factors outside of our control, business leaders should be focused on planning and prioritizing employee wellbeing, investing in training and skills development, hiring new staff and adopting the latest technologies to enable employees to work smarter, not harder."" But 34 per cent of business leaders believe the hybrid work arrangement will help with mitigating burnout. Over three quarters (76 per cent) of Canadian employers will allow workers to work from home in various degrees within a hybrid model post-pandemic, according to Sage. Helping employees Aside from the pressure of work, other factors also contribute to employee burnout, say Laura Giurge, postdoctoral research fellow in the organizational behaviour department at London Business School, and Vanessa Bohns, associate professor of organizational behaviour at the ILR School at Cornell University. “COVID-19 might amplify these pressures. Even for employees who have a natural preference to separate their work and personal lives, the current circumstances may not allow them to do so,” they say. “Many schools are closed and daycare may no longer be an option, placing additional burdens on working parents or low-income workers. Even companies that already encourage employees to work from home are likely to have some trouble supporting employees who face the many challenges of working at home in the presence of their families.” Nearly half of professionals working remotely (49 per cent) say that being on camera during meetings makes them more exhausted, according to a separate report.

This is a groundbreaking case with massive ramifications for employers everywhere that placed staff on temporary layoff, reduced their wages or implemented other significant changes in order to try and weather the pandemic. First, we need to address why this case is “groundbreaking”. The result in Coutinho may not seem surprising when we consider that a constructive dismissal occurs where an employer makes a unilateral and substantial change to a fundamental term or condition of the employment relationship. After all, it is hard to imagine a more substantial change than sending an employee home without pay. Pre-pandemic, the law was settled that a unilateral layoff constituted grounds for constructive dismissal. So, what changed? Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to entirely novel challenges from an employment law perspective. Many Canadian employers suddenly found themselves in the position of having to take drastic action to keep their businesses afloat. Often employers could not afford to maintain staff at pre-pandemic levels, but equally could not afford the cost of dismissing employees or did not want to permanently lose workers. As a result, temporary layoffs, as well as other significant changes, such as reductions in compensation packages or hours of work for employees became the go-to response for many employers impacted by the pandemic. Regulation changes Another significant change occurred in May 2020, when the Ontario government introduced a regulation that amended the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA) to make it clear that an employee who was placed on a temporary layoff or who had their pay or hours of work reduced due to COVID-19 was deemed to be on Infectious Disease Emergency Leave (IDEL). The consequence of this change was that employees who could ordinarily have pursued a claim for constructive dismissal as a result of such unilateral changes were no longer eligible to do so under the ESA. Unfortunately, this created a false sense of security for many employers, who did not appreciate that the ESA does not impact an employee’s entitlements at common law. Despite the fact that the ESA itself is quite clear on this point (section 8(1) expressly states that an employee’s civil rights are not impacted by any provisions of the ESA), this change still prompted significant debate amongst employment lawyers about whether or not an employee’s common law right to sue for constructive dismissal could also be impacted. The decision in Coutinho, at least for the time being, has provided us with an answer. Clinic closes The plaintiff in this case was employed as an office manager at an ophthalmic clinic in Cambridge. On May 1, 2020, the the woman was advised that the Cambridge clinic was closed, but that she would be paid until further notice. On May 29, 2020, the employer advised the manager that she was being placed on a temporary layoff, without pay, commencing as of that same date. Two days later, the plaintiff brought an action against the employer seeking damages for constructive dismissal. In its defence, the clinic relied on the Ontario government’s changes to the ESA to argue that it had not constructively dismissed the manager, noting that she was deemed to be on IDEL, not a layoff. Ultimately, the plaintiff was re-employed a few weeks later, on July 22, 2020. The clinic brought a motion for summary judgment to dismiss her claim on the basis that a) she was deemed to be on IDEL and therefore had not been constructively dismissedl and b) she had fully mitigated her damages. Court weighs in The Court wasted very little time dismissing the employer’s first argument, stating plainly that the changes to the ESA did not affect the office manager’s right to pursue a civil claim for constructive dismissal at common law. Counsel for the clinic argued that in light of the unprecedented emergency brought on by the pandemic, as well as the severe impact on employers and employees, the amendments to the ESA should be interpreted to apply to constructive dismissals under both the ESA and at common law. The court disagreed, finding that it was simply not possible to reconcile the employer’s argument with section 8(1) of the ESA, or the guidance that had been released by the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development on this point, which also confirmed that the ESA had no impact on an employee’s claim for constructive dismissal at common law. Key takeaways The decision in Coutinho will come as unwelcome news for many employers. However, it is important to remember that this case does not invalidate all temporary layoffs that may have been implemented during the pandemic. A constructive dismissal only occurs in circumstances in which a unilateral change is imposed on an employee by their employer ─ as a result, employers that obtained consent from staff prior to imposing layoffs will likely be insulated. In addition, although we now have some direction from the Ontario courts with respect to this issue, it is unlikely we can consider this matter settled. We anticipate seeing a significant amount of litigation arising out of the pandemic, and more opportunities for judges to comment on this issue in the future.

A: “Typically, an employer cannot ask about any kind of medical-related information unless it is relevant to some aspect of the job or some benefit that the employee is getting. “Many of the employers who have been asking around vaccinations fall into two large distinct buckets. The first bucket is health care, day care, vulnerable sector — areas where arguably as part of the health and safety plan, vaccination is a key component. You may have a requirement that a nurse be vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella; a daycare worker may have to be vaccinated against other transmissible diseases. That’s one bucket. “The other area where we’re seeing this happen is where employers are saying: ‘We will give you paid time off to get your vaccine appointment but then that is predicated upon you providing us proof of you getting the vaccine,’ because that’s the eligibility requirements for getting the paid time off.” Q: What are the privacy laws around all of this? A: “Ontario does not have significant legislative privacy protection in the private sector, employment-record area but employers really need to work on the best practices of privacy. “That means obtaining consent, disclosing the reasons which the information is being sought and disclosing how the information will be kept protected and ultimately discarded if it’s not required any longer. “In Quebec and B.C., they do have privacy legislation about employee data, and you would have to comply with those requirements just like employers have to comply for any other confidential and personal information that they gather.” Q: Can an employer require an employee to be vaccinated? A: “In Quebec, the public health authorities have said health-care workers have to be vaccinated. In that context, it becomes an easy legal question: Have you complied with the law? Are you vaccinated? For the rest of the provinces, it’s much more complicated. “In the unionized sector, there’s law about management rules and new management rules such as you have to get a COVID-19 injection. These really have to be developed in consultation with the union and reasonable under the rubric of legitimate management rights and so it’s very difficult in a unionized setting to impose a mandatory vaccination policy unilaterally. Neena Gupta “In the non-unionized sector, it’s a very interesting analysis. You may have an argument, if you’re forcing people effectively to be vaccinated in order to work, you’re imposing work conditions that didn’t exist before and it’s kind of a constructive dismissal. We don’t have that law yet. If it’s a new employee, you could argue, ‘I’m setting the new terms, you can take the job on this basis or not.’” Q: Are there legitimate reasons for an employee to refuse a vaccine? A: “The areas that are protected under the law are human rights, particularly disability and illness and possibly religion and creed, and so [if] an employee says, ‘Well, I’ve got a protected reason to refuse vaccination,’ then the employer has an obligation to accommodate those requests. “The human rights tribunals in Canada, at least in Ontario and B.C., have sent signals that being an anti-vaxxer or being an anti-masker or being a person who believes COVID-19 is a hoax is not sufficient to trigger human rights protection. “But you still have a legitimate number of people — maybe as high as two to four per cent — who can’t get the vaccine for health reasons.” Q: Can an employer terminate an employee for refusing to get the vaccine? A: “Refusal to take a vaccine is unlikely to be seen as just cause for termination, except maybe in circumstances where there’s some kind of high degree of risk: long-term care, highly vulnerable people. “If you’re going to terminate people, in most cases, if you’re in the non-unionized workplace, you can terminate anybody you want, provided that you provide them adequate notice and that’s in the common-law provinces. “If you’re a federal employer, after a regular non-management employee’s been there for 12 months, they have specific protections against unjust dismissal and I’m not entirely convinced that you could say you’ve got a just reason to terminate because somebody refused a vaccine. “In the unionized context, you can definitely expect robust grievances if an employer seeks to terminate a worker because they refused to have a vaccine.” Canadian HR Reporter has also spoken with experts about mask-wearing in the workplace and how to prevent employee fraud.

By Jim Wilson Jul 06, 2021 Share An Ontario union is criticizing the makeup of a committee formed by the Ontario government focused on economic recovery. The Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) is calling for a halt to the Ontario Workforce Recovery Advisory Committee (OWRAC), saying that it is “deeply flawed”. Monte McNaughton, minister of labour, training and skills development, recently established the OWRAC to provide recommendations to shape the future of work in the province. The committee’s mandate is to provide recommendations on how to position Ontario as the best place in North America to recruit, retain and reward workers. Its focus is on economic recovery, strengthening Ontario’s competitive position and supporting workers. The committee will lead consultations and report back to the minister with their policy recommendations. However, the OFL says the group lacks representation from labour, workers, or labour and employment law experts, despite having experts from other fields. “The committee’s makeup and its consultation process are fundamentally flawed. The process must be immediately halted, and the committee must be reconstituted,” says Patty Coates, OFL president. “Working people deserve a seat at the table and to have meaningful input into the decisions that will shape their futures. We are calling on the government to put the brakes on this deeply flawed consultation process and to authentically and meaningfully engage with working people and their representatives.” The fact that the Ontario government struck a panel on the future of labour and employment law and didn’t invite a representative from the labour movement but included bankers “says everything you need to know about this committee,” tweeted David Doorey, a law professor at York University in Toronto. “Frankly, [it’s] a weird decision by the Tories.” Rubber stamp? OFL also notes that the creation of the OWRAC follows Uber’s “Flexible Work+” proposal. Uber proposed rules requiring gig companies to provide “self-directed benefits” to their drivers based only on hours driving and certain unspecified additional safety training and tools. “Given the rushed and deeply flawed nature of the consultation process, we can only conclude that the [Doug] Ford government is using this sham process to rubber-stamp the carve-outs from workers’ rights that Uber is lobbying for,” says Coates. “Ontario’s labour movement stands united with gig workers against a Proposition 22-style plan to take away their rights at work.” Several stakeholders have previously criticized Uber’s pitch. The OFL adds that Uber’s proposed changes would deny gig workers core protections afforded to employees in Ontario like the minimum wage, overtime pay, and paid sick days. Instead of taking away these workers’ rights, the OFL is calling on the Ontario government to take action to proactively enforce gig workers’ rights, and to clarify their status as employees. “App-based gig workers deserve the same rights as all other employees – full stop,” said Coates. “The Ontario government should enforce the laws already on the books to protect gig workers, and should follow the lead of courts and governments around the world and confirm that gig workers are employees and entitled to basic employment protections. Any calls to carve these workers out of their employment protections must be soundly rejected.” Comments welcome The committee will lead consultations and deliver a report with recommendations that address the complexities and opportunities caused or accelerated by the COVID-19covid 19 pandemic, according to the government, including: changes in technology the growth of work-from-anywhere employment the significance of skills development in the global labour market The recommendations on the future of work will focus on three pillars: Economic recovery: How to make Ontario the top jurisdiction with a world-class workforce and talent supply Strengthening Ontario’s competitive position: In an increasingly remote, global and technologically advanced economy, how will we ensure that Ontario remains the best place in North America to recruit, retain, and reward workers? Supporting workers: How to ensure Ontario’s technology platform workers benefit from flexibility, control, and security The deadline for input is July 31. Recently, Ontario announced it is investing $7.7 million through 19 programs to help immigrants impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic start new careers. It also announced a $7-million investment for the training and paid job placements of workers belonging to underrepresented groups in the automotive manufacturing sector.

By Sarah Dobson Jul 15, 2021 Share All too often, HR or management is faced with an employee who announces they have found a job elsewhere. And when the departing individual is one of your top employees, it’s just bad news. But all is not lost ─ there are several steps employers can take to try an entice the person to change their mind. And if all else fails, a friendly separation is always preferred. What exactly are they looking for? To start, you want to get in front of it, says Gary Hinde, a partner at IQ Partners in Toronto. “You want to be a part of the solution, find out what's driving the decision, what's missing, and try to address those in a very empathetic way,” he says. “Candidates have options these days, and the power has really shifted over, so you want to be a part of the solution. And if there is anything that's missing, you want to try to address that.” It’s about having a conversation and asking if there's anything that the organization can do to retain the employee, says Emily Siu, a lawyer at Spring Law in Toronto. “Then the employer can really consider whether the employer has something to offer that can get the employee to stay. So considering things like the capacity of the business, and then the interest of the business… just trying to have an open dialogue with the employee in order to figure out if there's some sort of middle ground, something that the employee can do to make them stay.” There may be elements that were not overtly expressed to the employer, she says, so it’s about having an open dialogue, getting a sense of what it is that the employee might be willing to accept to hopefully get the employee to stay. Does a pay raise make sense? If the unhappy employee is just looking to earn more money, that’s almost a best case scenario, says Hinde. “That's a relatively easy fix.” But any compensation increases have to be genuine. “Throwing money at a problem rarely fixes things. And, let's face it, at the end of the day, with taxes, even a 5K bump… is going to be negligible on a paycheck. So, it isn't always the best solution, but is a gesture, more than anything,” he says. “I'd probably recommend that that's a temporary fix though. If somebody has it in their mind [to go]… and there’s an extra $20 every week, they're probably still going to leave eventually.” And if an outright bump in salary isn’t practical, the employer could pave the way by suggesting other ways to earn more money, says Hinde. For example: “How about this, if you were to set on a course to move ahead in your career, and move up, that would earn you more money.’ So, again, be a part of the overall bigger picture and the solution.” Career progression, training Providing guidance or support around the person’s career trajectory could also entice them to stay if that's a key reason that they're leaving, he says. “’What's missing right now for you? What can I do to help?’ would be the two things that I would bring up. ‘How can we get you to where you want to be? And what would that look like?’ So again, being a part of the solution, but really having them explain to you what it is that they're looking for.” A lot of people are looking to get into leadership or management, they just don't know where to start, he says. “Quite often, a good conversation with an individual like this might be ‘What if you were to build a team around you? What would happen if I helped you become an active manager?’ that type of thing. There may even be a more junior employee that would benefit from working for this individual.” And sometimes even a lateral move will make the difference, says Hinde. “Sometimes it's just [about] a change… ‘Maybe you just don't enjoy working on my team? And that's fine, I'm a big person, I can accept that. Would you like working on Jane's team?’ Or maybe there's a move internally that would take the individual?” Training considerations In addition, for key employees who might be at the later stages of their career, and at a high level in the company, offering some sort of educational bonus as part of the offering could be attractive to them in the area of professional development and training, says Siu. “Having a stipend for that could be something that is helpful or hiring a coach and having the company agree to that.” Mentorships could also appeal to top talent in the later stages of their career, she says. “They might also be looking to mentor other employees… once they start doing that, they might feel like this is something that they really enjoy and feeling like they can make a positive impact, can be a bit of a boost and make them feel valuable. [It’s about] genuinely allowing them to share their expertise and perspective based on their talents and interests.” But there’s a fine line when you suddenly make that kind of offer, says Hinde. “The employee might turn to you and say, ‘Well, why haven't you been doing that? I've been here for three years and now you're saying that you want to do a one-on-one mentoring session...’” Make people feel valued Often, employees feel like their work or contributions aren't valued, or they're not respected enough, so they look for alternate employment. In that case, employers have to step up and make that person feel important in their role, says Siu. “Sometimes, that may be underestimated by employers when they're looking at the bigger picture about the business picture, but the small little pieces ─ such as recognizing employees, contributions, and efforts ─ really do matter as well.” But it’s not to make these gestures in some sort of forced or contrived way, she says, “because if you offer something that isn't really appropriate or is just something that is a little bit performative, then the employee can probably see through that. And other employees might be able to see through that as well.” Exit interviews If all else fails and the employee is determined to leave, there are the usual legal consideration to consider, such as employment contracts and resignation notice periods, along with confidentiality and restrictive covenants, says Siu. But to keep things cordial, employers may also want to consider an exit interview to probe a little deeper about an employee’s reason for leaving, she sys. “Having an exit interview with the employee can really be helpful for the employer, just to get the feedback. Because it might flag issues that upper management might not be aware of, and maybe the employee is leaving for a bigger institutional reason, some sort of issue that they have with the company as a whole, and the company might not be aware of that. So having an exit interview could [also] be very useful in preserving other employees who currently work there or incoming.” There are some people who see a downside to this approach and question their credibility, says Hinde. “[The concern is] that people will just either tell you exactly what you want to hear, because they want to get out of there, or they will be very jaded if they haven't had a good experience and use it as a time to basically bad mouth [someone]. It's a ‘What do I have to lose?’ kind of mindset: ‘I can tell you whatever I want right now.’” But Hinde says he is in favour of the exit interview. “I personally feel that they're a good thing to do, if for no other reason than you're exiting somebody in a very professional manner. And you're probably going to find something out ─ maybe even things that you don't want to hear ─ about yourself or your management style, but it's still a good thing.” Latest stories HR jobs for the week of July 19 Attention employers: Feds open applications for Jobs and Growth Fund Mixed messaging on hiring plans Free newsletter The Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date on news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

Ottawa considering option for federally regulated workplaces By Jim Wilson Aug 04, 2021 Share Ottawa is seeking feedback from Canadians on the subject of free menstrual products in the workplace. The government says it wants to ensure women in federally regulated workplaces have access to menstrual products to reduce the physical and psychological health risks, the prevalence of harassment and violence in the workplace and the prevalence of missed work due to a lack of access to menstrual products. This will also support the federal government’s commitments to gender equity, it says. The survey aims to collect information on: providing menstrual products in in-office, non-traditional, and remote workplaces, including mobile employees the method of dispensing menstrual products in federally regulated workplaces the need for educational materials alongside this policy The consultation is open until Sept. 7, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of difficulties to everyone, but female workers are disproportionately affected compared with their male counterparts, according to a previous report. 2019 feedback In May 2019, the Labour Program published a Notice of Intent in the Canada Gazette, Part I. The notice outlined a proposal to require employers to provide free menstrual products in their workplaces. The government also gave stakeholders and members of the public the opportunity to provide input on the proposal for a period of 60 days. Out of the 42 respondents, 57 per cent were supportive of the proposal, 41 per cent were against the proposal and two per cent were neutral. Also, many participants raised further questions for consideration, and those who submitted feedback were more critical of the proposal. Out of the 29 submissions from individuals, 38 per cent were supportive of the proposal, 59 per cent were against the proposal and three per cent were neutral. “Gender equality is not about men and women being biologically the same, but is about addressing barriers to equality, and allocating resources to programs and decision-making that takes these barriers into consideration to level the playing field,” said one respondent. “Females working for the government are well paid, and the taxpayers should not be burdened with providing their sanitary needs,” said another. Hyundai Auto Canada, Bounteous and Altima Dental Canada are among the winners of the Best Workplace for Women for 2021, according to MediaCorp.

By John Dujay Sep 08, 2021 Share Last week, we looked at some of the practical considerations around what an employer should be thinking about when implementing a mandatory vaccination policy at the workplace. But what about privacy, especially when we are talking about potentially sensitive employee medical information? Canadian HR Reporter asked Lyndsay Wasser, partner privacy data protection at McMillan in Toronto, about some of the ways employers should safeguard that data. Q: What should be included in a written policy? A: “From a privacy law perspective, the considerations will vary somewhat because the legislation varies depending on the jurisdiction and whether it’s a private sector or public sector organization but the federal, provincial and territorial privacy commissioners have issued a joint statement on privacy and COVID-19 vaccine passports — as they call them — which is really just proof of vaccination. “As part of that, what they suggested is that there certainly needs to be defined purposes as to why it’s necessary to collect this information and consideration of the effectiveness and the proportionality of the policies. But in terms of the content of the policy, what would certainly be addressed is the purposes for which the information is being collected and will be used ,and there should be information about how long the information will be kept, and who it will be shared with and also the retention period for how long the information is going to be retained. “One of the most important things is to make sure that the purposes are accurately described and described in full because often the policy is serving a statutory notice requirement and in some jurisdictions, information about employees can only be collected if the purposes have been explained in advance. “What you don’t want is to have a partial list of purposes in your policy and then use the information for another ancillary purpose that wasn’t made clear because that would put you outside privacy legislation. “The policy should also contain information on who the individuals should contact if they have questions and if they want to access or correct any information that the company has on file with respect to their vaccination status.” Q: What constitutes proof of vaccination for employees? A: “The guidance privacy regulators have provided is that the organization should collect the minimum amount of information required in the circumstances — which is a general tenet of privacy law for anything — which is called data minimization, which is only collect, use and disclose the minimum information necessary to achieve your purposes. “Obviously, the honour system is likely the least amount of information but keeping in mind the requirements of necessity, effectiveness and proportionality, you have to think about: is it going to be as effective to rely on the honour system if it could be that employees are misrepresenting or misunderstanding in some way a requirement? And will that be as effective? “If there’s a way to confirm vaccination status, short of the full vaccination certificate, then that’s helpful as well. Lyndsay Wasser “One method that has some merit to it is having individuals display or present to an authorized person their proof of vaccination but not having the company copy or retain or retain that documentation. In other words, show it to the person so that they make a note that they’ve confirmed vaccination but that way you’re not retaining more information than you need to. “That may be easier said than done when many workers are remote at this time but the key is to design a process that takes into account that data-minimization principle.” Q: “How should an employee’s private medical information be secured? A: “There’s a number of best practices. The requirement is to implement appropriate physical, technological and organizational safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, and also the format and method of storage of the information: that’s the overarching statutory requirements. “What that means in practice is if you’re maintaining information in electronic form, you’ll want it to be accessible only to the authorized individuals. Whether that is in private files or password-protected files, [the employer] might want to consider encryption given the sensitivity of the information. “Physical safeguards would be things like making sure that any information that’s in hard copy is locked up in filing cabinets and not left out on desks and then organizational safeguards are things like appropriate policies and procedures, that individuals who have access to the information are required to follow when they’re handling that information. “Organizations need to think about both the transmission of the information — so if you’re asking individuals to provide the proof of vaccination, you have to make sure that you set up a secure form of transmission and then also, once the information is within the hands of the organization, to make sure that the physical and the technological and the organization’s safeguards are in place. “Generally, health information should be kept separate and apart from the individual personnel file, the general HR file, because likely the authorized person to access that information is a smaller group that the personnel file might be accessible to a broader HR group or to a manager in some circumstances but the health information should definitely be restricted on a strict need-to-know basis, which means that essentially it’s preferable to keep it separate. “The privacy regulator’s guidelines also suggests that creation of central databases across nationally or across jurisdictions shouldn’t be permitted but rather it is better to store that information locally as well.” Recently, the city of Ottawa released a vaccination guide for employers while KPMG also announced its own mandatory policy. Q: Who should have access to the data? A: “The general principle is that the access that should be strictly limited to those who have a need to know the information to perform their job duties. “If there is an individual or a small group responsible for the health and safety of the workforce or for managing the company’s COVID response processes and procedures, those will be the people who would need access but again, if you have a large HR group within your organization and only certain individuals have been tasked with implementing appropriate controls for preventing and reducing the spread of COVID-19, then it would be that task force or team that would have but it should really be a tight knit group of individuals who need to perform the duties. “The key thing to remember is that we are dealing with a very dynamic, changing legal landscape. The government guidance and the legislation case law is coming out on a rolling basis, sometimes quite quickly, so it’s really important for organizations to make sure that when they are making decisions or changing their plan, that they do make sure they get up-to-date guidance; even guidance a few weeks ago is already going to be out of date unfortunately. It is critical to keep abreast of the new developments.” Latest stories Pay Equity Act finally comes into effect Benefits fraud warrants supervisor’s firing Is refusing a vaccine considered a frustration of contract?

Canadian HR Reporter spoke with Paul Boshyk, partner employment labour relations at McMillan in Toronto, about some of the legal landmines employers will have to be aware of when implementing such a policy. Q: Does an employer have to mandate a vaccination policy? A: “Generally speaking, employers are not required to have mandatory vaccination policies, although there are some potential exceptions. “One would be in Toronto [after] Toronto’s medical health officer, Eileen de Villa, issued a statement ‘strongly recommending’ that all employers in Toronto institute a workplace vaccination policy that is going to have to require that workers provide proof of their vaccination status; that unvaccinated employees have to provide written proof of a medical reason; and also that unvaccinated workers have to complete a vaccination education course. “Some have taken the view that because of the way that step three regulation is written, and employers have to comply with the recommendations and instructions of public health officials, that statement would fall under that requirement.” Q: Has there been any guidance provided by the courts? A: “Not when it comes to COVID vaccination policies. There have been some legal decisions with respect to unionized workplaces in the context of the flu vaccine but those cases primarily dealt with employees who were either frontline workers or worked with vulnerable members of the population, and focused on whether the employer had the management rights to institute a mandatory flu vaccination policy. What we’re talking about with the COVID vaccine is uncharted waters and we don’t have unfortunately, guidance from the courts.” Q: What items should be included in a written policy? A: “The policy has to be clear and unambiguous. The purpose of the policy is going to have to be clearly stated. It’s also going to be important to frame what the consequences of not complying with that policy may be. “Whether that’s a termination of employment, whether that’s some other arrangement pursuant to which the employee might be working under conditions where vaccination is of last consequence, ultimately that’s going to be a decision for the employer to make based on a particular workplace and their own customers and clients and so forth. But clearly explaining to employees what the consequences of failing to comply with the mandatory vaccination policy is an essential component.” Q: What are the reasons a worker can be exempted from the policy? A: “Under applicable human rights legislation, disability is a protected characteristic, as is religion or creed, depending on which jurisdiction you’re in. It’s conceivable that there are persons who for reasons of disability or religion or creed are unable to get vaccinated and when that happens, employers do have an obligation to reasonably accommodate those persons to the point of undue hardship. “The first step would be for the employee to provide evidence and information to the employer about the reason why they’re unable to comply with the employer’s mandatory vaccination rule so that the employer can assess that information and try and determine first about whether a reasonable accommodation without undue hardship is possible. Paul Boshyk “In particular, arrangements whereby the employee could continue to work remotely to the fullest extent possible or heightened health and safety protocols that may exist for that particular employee, depending on the case. Whether it’s continuing to wear a mask after the face-covering requirements have gone away, whether that’s a face shield, whether that’s enhanced social distancing or a private office, it’s really going to depend on the facts of each case.” Q: What constitutes proof of vaccination? A: “A lot of employers are taking different approaches to this. Some employers are using the honour system, whereby employees are being asked to affirm or attest to their vaccination status and the employer is not requiring the employee to provide proof. Other employers are requiring some form of evidence to be given whether that’s the receipt or certificate that was provided by the applicable government authority. “It doesn’t help that there is still quite a patchwork of requirements across not just the various provinces but the various local municipalities as well. The patchwork approaches are not doing any favours to employers but it’s what we have to go on for the moment.” Q: Could a termination for refusing to get a vaccine be considered a frustration of contract? A: “That’s the million-dollar question and anyone who tells you that they know the answer to that question at this time definitively is probably lying to you. “There are some well-known employee-side lawyers who have provided their view that companies do have the right to institute mandatory vaccination policies, subject to human rights accommodations of course, but that for any employee who refuses to get vaccinated and isn’t subject to reasonable accommodation, has to be paid their notice in severance or has to be given their notice and severance as if they had been dismissed from their employment without cause. “But another argument is employers under the occupational health and safety legislation have a general duty to ensure the health and safety of all workers in the workplace and it certainly it is arguable that within that right, there is a right to mandate mandatory vaccination policies. But whether failure to comply with that triggers an obligation to pay severance or whether it results in the frustration of an employee’s employment, it’s still very much a legal grey area that the courts are going to have to provide guidance on before anyone can definitively say, one way or the other. “In those circumstances where it’s a government mandate, I can see a strong argument for frustration of the employment contract. In those circumstances where it’s mandated into law and the and the employee refuses, it’s for the judges, the courts and the tribunals to decide and unless and until we have that clear guidance, no lawyer can say with a straight face that they know for certain where the chips are going to fall on this.” Recently, we asked some other legal questions about rapid testing in the workplace and as well as about mask-wearing policies.
