Based on direction from Niagara Region Public Health and the Town of Lincoln, and out of an abundance of care and concern for our staff, our customers and the public, all Lincoln Public Library locations are closed until further notice. All programs, events and room rentals are canceled. We will continue to monitor the situation and evaluate whether this date will need to be extended. I want to assure you that we have not made this decision lightly. We know how many of you rely on us, and the impact that these closures will have. However, ensuring the health and well-being of our community, and the safety of our customers and staff must be our priority. During this temporary closure, we are taking several steps to support you as much as possible: If you have books currently on loan, please hold onto them. You will not incur any late fees during this time. As well, any outstanding library fines will not accumulate while branches are closed. If you have holds, they will be waiting for you when our branches reopen. You will not be charged any fines for not picking them up. All our online resources are available 24/7 and can be accessed remotely using your library card. Visit www.lincoln.library.on.ca to download e-books, e-audiobooks and magazines; stream movies and music; and use our online resources. Customer support and information services will continue to be available by email to Julie Andrews CEO : andrews@lincoln.library.on.ca NEW! You can create a library card by calling or on our website. Call 905-563-7014 or 905-562-5711 or visit www.lincoln.library.on.ca and we will set you up! As you know, this is a constantly evolving situation.

Based on direction from Niagara Region Public Health and the Town of Lincoln, and out of an abundance of care and concern for our staff, our customers and the public, all Lincoln Public Library locations are closed until further notice. All programs, events and room rentals are canceled. We will continue to monitor the situation and evaluate whether this date will need to be extended. I want to assure you that we have not made this decision lightly. We know how many of you rely on us, and the impact that these closures will have. However, ensuring the health and well-being of our community, and the safety of our customers and staff must be our priority. During this temporary closure, we are taking several steps to support you as much as possible: If you have books currently on loan, please hold onto them. You will not incur any late fees during this time. As well, any outstanding library fines will not accumulate while branches are closed. If you have holds, they will be waiting for you when our branches reopen. You will not be charged any fines for not picking them up.

In particular, we acknowledge the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe peoples, many of whom continue to live and work here today. We recognize and deeply appreciate their historic connection to this place. We also recognize the contributions First Nations, Métis, Inuit and other Indigenous peoples have made, both in shaping and strengthening this community, our province and our country.
