Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the intention of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on May 12, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com. On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the intention of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on May 12, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com. On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the intention of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on May 12, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened.

We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date?

Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the intention of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on May 12, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com. On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on May 12, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on May 19, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on May 19, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on June 2, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on July 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on June 2, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on June 15, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date?

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount?

Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date?

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on June 15, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on June 15, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on June 22, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. At this time, we hope to re-open our administration and box offices on June 22, 2020. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. We hope to re-open our administration and box offices soon. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. We hope to re-open our administration and box offices soon. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. We hope to re-open our administration and box offices soon. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on August 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. We hope to re-open our administration and box offices soon. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on September 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. We hope to re-open our administration and box offices soon. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on September 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. We hope to re-open our administration and box offices soon. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Of course it is frustrating to have to put that on hold, but if our aim is to create a more human, more connected theatre, then our first priority has to be keeping everyone safe. I know our amazing audience will understand and support us; and we send everyone our love and good thoughts. Please stay safe and well; we will get through this together.” – Tim Carroll, Artistic Director Thank you to our amazing audience for the outpouring of support for those of us here at The Shaw. The Shaw Festival is working to ensure our approach to the outbreak of COVID-19 – and its resulting repercussions on our patrons, our team members and our local community – is handled with care and consideration. Based on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s statement regarding mass gatherings, along with the guidance of the provincial and federal governments, the Shaw Festival has ceased all business on-site, including cancelling all public events and performances, with the hope of resuming on September 1, 2020. Mahabharata, scheduled to hit the stage in August, is cancelled for 2020 however we are committed to bringing it back in a future season. We hope to re-open our administration and box offices soon. Your health and safety, and that of our community, artists and staff, is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the situation to see if additional adjustments, closures or cancellations are required based on the direction and guidance of the public health units of Niagara, the province and the country. We apologize for any inconvenience. The full value of your tickets will be held on your account and a box office representative will be in touch to reschedule or refund once our offices have re-opened. If you have any ticket-related questions in the meantime, please email feedback@shawfest.com On behalf of our 600 company members and 350 volunteers, we wish you and all of our patrons well in these difficult times.

Will you join us? To purchase a Gift Membership, please call 1-800-657-1106 ext 2556. COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond.

Will you join us? To purchase a Gift Membership, please call 1-800-657-1106 ext 2556. COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Will you join us? To purchase a Gift Membership, please call 1-800-657-1106 ext 2556. COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Will you join us? To purchase a Gift Membership, please call 1-800-657-1106 ext 2556. COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Will you join us? To purchase a Gift Membership, please call 1-800-657-1106 ext 2556. COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Will you join us? To purchase a Gift Membership, please call 1-800-657-1106 ext 2556. COVID-19 Update Based on the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening businesses and the further extension of the State of Emergency, it is clear that the Shaw Festival is not able to proceed with the season as scheduled. As a result, The Shaw must cancel all performances and public events through September 15. The further delay has forced The Shaw to cancel most of the 2020 productions. All 2020 performances of Gypsy, The Devil’s Disciple, Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse, Prince Caspian, The Playboy of the Western World, Assassins, Desire Under the Elms, Trouble in Mind and Me and My Girl are cancelled. “We are all hungry for the special way that theatre allows us to join together and share a unique experience,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “Everyone in the company had been looking forward to bringing you a truly special season. It’s devastating to have had to put the season on hold; but I am determined that our audience will see as much of it as possible as soon as it is safe to share it with them.” “We have decided to remain optimistic and hopeful about presenting an abbreviated fall or holiday season, not only for ourselves and our audiences, but for the whole community of Niagara,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “With that in mind, we are in the process of seeing what kind of reduced performance schedule we could offer. As one of the primary tourism and economic generators for the Niagara Region, we are keenly aware of the $220 million in economic impact The Shaw normally drives to the Region and the thousands of jobs that are reliant on us. Our theatres are in the heart of downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake and a schedule featuring Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol might afford what we feel is the best way to help our community get back on its feet as soon as it is safe to do so. The question now is one of being able to do that safely and we await word from the Government and Public Health agencies on a variety of issues to ensure that is possible.” Performances of Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol after September 16 have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can safely welcome audiences into reduced-capacity theatres. The Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures in the coming weeks, in conjunction with guidance from public health and the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Festival will continue to follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. The Festival will announce details of any updated fall and holiday schedule in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, tickets for Charley’s Aunt, Flush and A Christmas Carol continue to be available online. This truncated season will only happen if it is deemed safe by the government and public health agencies to gather in the reduced capacity theatres. Ticket Inquiries At this time, the Shaw Festival administrative and box offices are closed until further notice. In the meantime ticket holders to cancelled performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of Box Office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update As the country and world continue to deal with the impact of the pandemic, the Shaw Festival is unable to realize performances in fall 2020. As a result, the Festival has cancelled the remaining performances of Charley’s Aunt and Flush. Performances of A Christmas Carol have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can welcome reduced-capacity audiences into the Royal George Theatre for the holiday season. “We know it looks insurmountable to return to the stage in 2020, but we at The Shaw are holding onto hope for a holiday season,” said Kimberley Rampersad, Associate Artistic Director. “Our hope is a candle – it may flicker, but it will not go out. We will be hopeful for the future of our art and we look forward to the day we get to welcome our beloved patrons back to the theatre.” The Shaw continues to plan for A Christmas Carol, but performances will only happen if it is deemed safe for the audiences, artists and company members. Later this fall, the Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures that follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date?

The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

COVID-19 Update As the country and world continue to deal with the impact of the pandemic, the Shaw Festival is unable to realize performances in fall 2020. As a result, the Festival has cancelled the remaining performances of Charley’s Aunt and Flush. Performances of A Christmas Carol have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can welcome reduced-capacity audiences into the Royal George Theatre for the holiday season. “We know it looks insurmountable to return to the stage in 2020, but we at The Shaw are holding onto hope for a holiday season,” said Kimberley Rampersad, Associate Artistic Director. “Our hope is a candle – it may flicker, but it will not go out. We will be hopeful for the future of our art and we look forward to the day we get to welcome our beloved patrons back to the theatre.” The Shaw continues to plan for A Christmas Carol, but performances will only happen if it is deemed safe for the audiences, artists and company members. Later this fall, the Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures that follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order.

COVID-19 Update As the country and world continue to deal with the impact of the pandemic, the Shaw Festival is unable to realize performances in fall 2020. As a result, the Festival has cancelled the remaining performances of Charley’s Aunt and Flush. Performances of A Christmas Carol have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can welcome reduced-capacity audiences into the Royal George Theatre for the holiday season. “We know it looks insurmountable to return to the stage in 2020, but we at The Shaw are holding onto hope for a holiday season,” said Kimberley Rampersad, Associate Artistic Director. “Our hope is a candle – it may flicker, but it will not go out. We will be hopeful for the future of our art and we look forward to the day we get to welcome our beloved patrons back to the theatre.” The Shaw continues to plan for A Christmas Carol, but performances will only happen if it is deemed safe for the audiences, artists and company members. Later this fall, the Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures that follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update As the country and world continue to deal with the impact of the pandemic, the Shaw Festival is unable to realize performances in fall 2020. As a result, the Festival has cancelled the remaining performances of Charley’s Aunt and Flush. Performances of A Christmas Carol have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can welcome reduced-capacity audiences into the Royal George Theatre for the holiday season. “We know it looks insurmountable to return to the stage in 2020, but we at The Shaw are holding onto hope for a holiday season,” said Kimberley Rampersad, Associate Artistic Director. “Our hope is a candle – it may flicker, but it will not go out. We will be hopeful for the future of our art and we look forward to the day we get to welcome our beloved patrons back to the theatre.” The Shaw continues to plan for A Christmas Carol, but performances will only happen if it is deemed safe for the audiences, artists and company members. Later this fall, the Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures that follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update As the country and world continue to deal with the impact of the pandemic, the Shaw Festival is unable to realize performances in fall 2020. As a result, the Festival has cancelled the remaining performances of Charley’s Aunt and Flush. Performances of A Christmas Carol have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can welcome reduced-capacity audiences into the Royal George Theatre for the holiday season. “We know it looks insurmountable to return to the stage in 2020, but we at The Shaw are holding onto hope for a holiday season,” said Kimberley Rampersad, Associate Artistic Director. “Our hope is a candle – it may flicker, but it will not go out. We will be hopeful for the future of our art and we look forward to the day we get to welcome our beloved patrons back to the theatre.” The Shaw continues to plan for A Christmas Carol, but performances will only happen if it is deemed safe for the audiences, artists and company members. Later this fall, the Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures that follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update As the country and world continue to deal with the impact of the pandemic, the Shaw Festival is unable to realize performances in fall 2020. As a result, the Festival has cancelled the remaining performances of Charley’s Aunt and Flush. Performances of A Christmas Carol have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can welcome reduced-capacity audiences into the Royal George Theatre for the holiday season. “We know it looks insurmountable to return to the stage in 2020, but we at The Shaw are holding onto hope for a holiday season,” said Kimberley Rampersad, Associate Artistic Director. “Our hope is a candle – it may flicker, but it will not go out. We will be hopeful for the future of our art and we look forward to the day we get to welcome our beloved patrons back to the theatre.” The Shaw continues to plan for A Christmas Carol, but performances will only happen if it is deemed safe for the audiences, artists and company members. Later this fall, the Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures that follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount?

COVID-19 Update As the country and world continue to deal with the impact of the pandemic, the Shaw Festival is unable to realize performances in fall 2020. As a result, the Festival has cancelled the remaining performances of Charley’s Aunt and Flush. Performances of A Christmas Carol have not yet been cancelled in the hopes that The Shaw can welcome reduced-capacity audiences into the Royal George Theatre for the holiday season. “We know it looks insurmountable to return to the stage in 2020, but we at The Shaw are holding onto hope for a holiday season,” said Kimberley Rampersad, Associate Artistic Director. “Our hope is a candle – it may flicker, but it will not go out. We will be hopeful for the future of our art and we look forward to the day we get to welcome our beloved patrons back to the theatre.” The Shaw continues to plan for A Christmas Carol, but performances will only happen if it is deemed safe for the audiences, artists and company members. Later this fall, the Festival will announce details of protocols and safety measures that follow and exceed the directives of the local, provincial and federal governments and Canadian public health agencies. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled Shaw Festival performances will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information.

COVID-19 Update As the number of active COVID-19 cases in Ontario increases, the Shaw Festival is forced to cancel its annual presentation of A Christmas Carol at the Royal George Theatre. “We held off making this decision for as long as we possibly could because we had set our hearts on getting back into one of our theatres this year. But it was not to be: the situation clearly calls for caution. We need to keep everyone safe,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “But our optimism remains unquenchable: we will do what we can, when we can, and we will be ready to leap into action the moment we get the nod. We are about to announce our plans for next season, which I hope and believe will be our best yet, not only because of the quality of the work we can offer, but because the people making that work, and witnessing that work, will do so with such passionate, renewed commitment to the life-affirming value of live theatre.” Since 2017, The Shaw’s production of A Christmas Carol has been a defining tradition during the holidays in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This season, the historic Old Town will be missing one of its mainstay holiday events, however the town will still be filled with holiday cheer. “We are all devastated by the cancellation of our final production of the 2020 season. The loss is heartbreaking, especially after hoping we’d be able to continue this annual holiday tradition that we know is cherished by so many,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “The continued outpouring of support we have received from our patrons, donors and community is amazing and humbling. We hear you and thank you.” “Despite the disappointment of cancelling A Christmas Carol, we continue to move forward with hope and find ways to share our art in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount?

COVID-19 Update As the number of active COVID-19 cases in Ontario increases, the Shaw Festival is forced to cancel its annual presentation of A Christmas Carol at the Royal George Theatre. “We held off making this decision for as long as we possibly could because we had set our hearts on getting back into one of our theatres this year. But it was not to be: the situation clearly calls for caution. We need to keep everyone safe,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “But our optimism remains unquenchable: we will do what we can, when we can, and we will be ready to leap into action the moment we get the nod. We are about to announce our plans for next season, which I hope and believe will be our best yet, not only because of the quality of the work we can offer, but because the people making that work, and witnessing that work, will do so with such passionate, renewed commitment to the life-affirming value of live theatre.” Since 2017, The Shaw’s production of A Christmas Carol has been a defining tradition during the holidays in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This season, the historic Old Town will be missing one of its mainstay holiday events, however the town will still be filled with holiday cheer. “We are all devastated by the cancellation of our final production of the 2020 season. The loss is heartbreaking, especially after hoping we’d be able to continue this annual holiday tradition that we know is cherished by so many,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “The continued outpouring of support we have received from our patrons, donors and community is amazing and humbling. We hear you and thank you.” “Despite the disappointment of cancelling A Christmas Carol, we continue to move forward with hope and find ways to share our art in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update As the number of active COVID-19 cases in Ontario increases, the Shaw Festival is forced to cancel its annual presentation of A Christmas Carol at the Royal George Theatre. “We held off making this decision for as long as we possibly could because we had set our hearts on getting back into one of our theatres this year. But it was not to be: the situation clearly calls for caution. We need to keep everyone safe,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “But our optimism remains unquenchable: we will do what we can, when we can, and we will be ready to leap into action the moment we get the nod. We are about to announce our plans for next season, which I hope and believe will be our best yet, not only because of the quality of the work we can offer, but because the people making that work, and witnessing that work, will do so with such passionate, renewed commitment to the life-affirming value of live theatre.” Since 2017, The Shaw’s production of A Christmas Carol has been a defining tradition during the holidays in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This season, the historic Old Town will be missing one of its mainstay holiday events, however the town will still be filled with holiday cheer. “We are all devastated by the cancellation of our final production of the 2020 season. The loss is heartbreaking, especially after hoping we’d be able to continue this annual holiday tradition that we know is cherished by so many,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “The continued outpouring of support we have received from our patrons, donors and community is amazing and humbling. We hear you and thank you.” “Despite the disappointment of cancelling A Christmas Carol, we continue to move forward with hope and find ways to share our art in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

COVID-19 Update As the number of active COVID-19 cases in Ontario increases, the Shaw Festival is forced to cancel its annual presentation of A Christmas Carol at the Royal George Theatre. “We held off making this decision for as long as we possibly could because we had set our hearts on getting back into one of our theatres this year. But it was not to be: the situation clearly calls for caution. We need to keep everyone safe,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “But our optimism remains unquenchable: we will do what we can, when we can, and we will be ready to leap into action the moment we get the nod. We are about to announce our plans for next season, which I hope and believe will be our best yet, not only because of the quality of the work we can offer, but because the people making that work, and witnessing that work, will do so with such passionate, renewed commitment to the life-affirming value of live theatre.” Since 2017, The Shaw’s production of A Christmas Carol has been a defining tradition during the holidays in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This season, the historic Old Town will be missing one of its mainstay holiday events, however the town will still be filled with holiday cheer. “We are all devastated by the cancellation of our final production of the 2020 season. The loss is heartbreaking, especially after hoping we’d be able to continue this annual holiday tradition that we know is cherished by so many,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “The continued outpouring of support we have received from our patrons, donors and community is amazing and humbling. We hear you and thank you.” “Despite the disappointment of cancelling A Christmas Carol, we continue to move forward with hope and find ways to share our art in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information.

COVID-19 Update As the number of active COVID-19 cases in Ontario increases, the Shaw Festival is forced to cancel its annual presentation of A Christmas Carol at the Royal George Theatre. “We held off making this decision for as long as we possibly could because we had set our hearts on getting back into one of our theatres this year. But it was not to be: the situation clearly calls for caution. We need to keep everyone safe,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “But our optimism remains unquenchable: we will do what we can, when we can, and we will be ready to leap into action the moment we get the nod. We are about to announce our plans for next season, which I hope and believe will be our best yet, not only because of the quality of the work we can offer, but because the people making that work, and witnessing that work, will do so with such passionate, renewed commitment to the life-affirming value of live theatre.” Since 2017, The Shaw’s production of A Christmas Carol has been a defining tradition during the holidays in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This season, the historic Old Town will be missing one of its mainstay holiday events, however the town will still be filled with holiday cheer. “We are all devastated by the cancellation of our final production of the 2020 season. The loss is heartbreaking, especially after hoping we’d be able to continue this annual holiday tradition that we know is cherished by so many,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “The continued outpouring of support we have received from our patrons, donors and community is amazing and humbling. We hear you and thank you.” “Despite the disappointment of cancelling A Christmas Carol, we continue to move forward with hope and find ways to share our art in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account.

We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date?

Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information.

COVID-19 Update As the number of active COVID-19 cases in Ontario increases, the Shaw Festival is forced to cancel its annual presentation of A Christmas Carol at the Royal George Theatre. “We held off making this decision for as long as we possibly could because we had set our hearts on getting back into one of our theatres this year. But it was not to be: the situation clearly calls for caution. We need to keep everyone safe,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “But our optimism remains unquenchable: we will do what we can, when we can, and we will be ready to leap into action the moment we get the nod. We are about to announce our plans for next season, which I hope and believe will be our best yet, not only because of the quality of the work we can offer, but because the people making that work, and witnessing that work, will do so with such passionate, renewed commitment to the life-affirming value of live theatre.” Since 2017, The Shaw’s production of A Christmas Carol has been a defining tradition during the holidays in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This season, the historic Old Town will be missing one of its mainstay holiday events, however the town will still be filled with holiday cheer. “We are all devastated by the cancellation of our final production of the 2020 season. The loss is heartbreaking, especially after hoping we’d be able to continue this annual holiday tradition that we know is cherished by so many,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “The continued outpouring of support we have received from our patrons, donors and community is amazing and humbling. We hear you and thank you.” “Despite the disappointment of cancelling A Christmas Carol, we continue to move forward with hope and find ways to share our art in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account.

Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information.

COVID-19 Update As the number of active COVID-19 cases in Ontario increases, the Shaw Festival is forced to cancel its annual presentation of A Christmas Carol at the Royal George Theatre. “We held off making this decision for as long as we possibly could because we had set our hearts on getting back into one of our theatres this year. But it was not to be: the situation clearly calls for caution. We need to keep everyone safe,” said Tim Carroll, Artistic Director. “But our optimism remains unquenchable: we will do what we can, when we can, and we will be ready to leap into action the moment we get the nod. We are about to announce our plans for next season, which I hope and believe will be our best yet, not only because of the quality of the work we can offer, but because the people making that work, and witnessing that work, will do so with such passionate, renewed commitment to the life-affirming value of live theatre.” Since 2017, The Shaw’s production of A Christmas Carol has been a defining tradition during the holidays in Niagara-on-the-Lake. This season, the historic Old Town will be missing one of its mainstay holiday events, however the town will still be filled with holiday cheer. “We are all devastated by the cancellation of our final production of the 2020 season. The loss is heartbreaking, especially after hoping we’d be able to continue this annual holiday tradition that we know is cherished by so many,” said Tim Jennings, Executive Director/CEO. “The continued outpouring of support we have received from our patrons, donors and community is amazing and humbling. We hear you and thank you.” “Despite the disappointment of cancelling A Christmas Carol, we continue to move forward with hope and find ways to share our art in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Thanks to our partners at FedDev Ontario, we have a series of outdoor concerts where we showcase the joy of live performance until we are able to gather together in our theatres,” continued Jennings. “I hope – as comfort and safety regulations allow – people will come to experience Niagara-on-the-Lake’s autumnal beauty and the magic of the holiday season in our picturesque town. Whether eating at our fabulous local restaurants, staying at our wonderful hotels and bed and breakfasts or finding the perfect holiday gift in our downtown shops. Niagara-on-the-Lake and The Shaw need everyone’s help to remain strong through these incredible and difficult times.” While the Shaw Festival’s theatres will remain empty in 2020, plans are already underway for the 2021 season. Details of The Shaw’s 2021 Season will be announced soon. Ticket Inquiries Ticket holders to cancelled performances of A Christmas Carol will have the full value of their tickets held on their account. A team of box office representatives is working remotely to contact ticket holders to discuss options such as leaving money on account for future exchanges, converting the ticket value to a charitable donation or issuing a refund.

We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date?

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply.

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Closed Captioning: Available for the August performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse. Smartphones and smartphone holders available by reservation or bring your own to download the app. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

Smartphones and smartphone holders available by reservation or bring your own to download the app. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited. Due to the limited number of spots, we do not offer advanced reservations for parking.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not. However, there are many other options available to take a behind the scenes look at the Shaw Festival. Check out the Tuesday Q&A, Continue the Conversation, Backstage Tours, Pre-Show Talks and more. Friends can also attend the Friends Post Show Receptions at the Festival Theatre. Are the theatres wheelchair accessible? Yes. There is no elevator to the balcony at the Festival or Royal George. Please advise the Box Office representative when ordering your tickets if you, or a member of your party, has concerns about accessibility. I am hearing-impaired. Do your theatres offer amplification? Yes, all Shaw Festival theatres are equipped with Sennheiser Infrared Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening devices can be booked in advance through the Box Office or online when you book your tickets. A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Closed Captioning: Available for the August performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse. Smartphones and smartphone holders available by reservation or bring your own to download the app. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited. Due to the limited number of spots, we do not offer advanced reservations for parking. Parking for the Royal George Theatre (85 Queen Street) is available, metered and non-metered, on the streets surrounding the theatre. Please allow extra time to find a parking space. Booking Tickets Online How do I know that my credit card information is secure and my information is kept private?

Why do I need to log in each time I order tickets?

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café.

The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres.

What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date?

Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not. However, there are many other options available to take a behind the scenes look at the Shaw Festival. Check out the Tuesday Q&A, Continue the Conversation, Backstage Tours, Pre-Show Talks and more. Friends can also attend the Friends Post Show Receptions at the Festival Theatre. Are the theatres wheelchair accessible? Yes. There is no elevator to the balcony at the Festival or Royal George.

Do your theatres offer amplification? Yes, all Shaw Festival theatres are equipped with Sennheiser Infrared Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening devices can be booked in advance through the Box Office or online when you book your tickets. A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Closed Captioning: Available for the August performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse. Smartphones and smartphone holders available by reservation or bring your own to download the app. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited. Due to the limited number of spots, we do not offer advanced reservations for parking. Parking for the Royal George Theatre (85 Queen Street) is available, metered and non-metered, on the streets surrounding the theatre. Please allow extra time to find a parking space. Booking Tickets Online How do I know that my credit card information is secure and my information is kept private?

Why do I need to log in each time I order tickets?

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink?

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

Assistive listening devices can be booked in advance through the Box Office or online when you book your tickets. A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Closed Captioning: Available for the August performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse. Smartphones and smartphone holders available by reservation or bring your own to download the app. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited. Due to the limited number of spots, we do not offer advanced reservations for parking. Parking for the Royal George Theatre (85 Queen Street) is available, metered and non-metered, on the streets surrounding the theatre. Please allow extra time to find a parking space.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply.

We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres.

Read More FAQs Tickets What happens if I lose my tickets? If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not. However, there are many other options available to take a behind the scenes look at the Shaw Festival. Check out the Tuesday Q&A, Continue the Conversation, Backstage Tours, Pre-Show Talks and more. Friends can also attend the Friends Post Show Receptions at the Festival Theatre. Are the theatres wheelchair accessible? Yes. There is no elevator to the balcony at the Festival or Royal George. Please advise the Box Office representative when ordering your tickets if you, or a member of your party, has concerns about accessibility. I am hearing-impaired. Do your theatres offer amplification? Yes, all Shaw Festival theatres are equipped with Sennheiser Infrared Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening devices can be booked in advance through the Box Office or online when you book your tickets. A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Closed Captioning: Available for the August performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse. Smartphones and smartphone holders available by reservation or bring your own to download the app. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited. Due to the limited number of spots, we do not offer advanced reservations for parking. Parking for the Royal George Theatre (85 Queen Street) is available, metered and non-metered, on the streets surrounding the theatre. Please allow extra time to find a parking space. Booking Tickets Online How do I know that my credit card information is secure and my information is kept private?

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable.

The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information.

At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres.

Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost.

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show?

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

Do your theatres offer amplification? Yes, all Shaw Festival theatres are equipped with Sennheiser Infrared Assistive Listening Systems.

A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Closed Captioning: Available for the August performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Raven’s Curse. Smartphones and smartphone holders available by reservation or bring your own to download the app. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee. Please arrive early as spots are limited.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2020 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. If the show is sold out the day of the performance, a waiting list will begin at 9am at the Festival Theatre Box Office. Names will be added to the waiting list in person only. The Shaw Festival reserves the right to close the waiting list to additional names at any time. Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? If you have a group of 15 or more people, you may qualify for a group discount. Please check out Group Ticket Sales for information on pricing, packages, and how to order. At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre and watch the show from the lobby monitor. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? You are welcome to bring your own food to the Festival Theatre, however, the lobby and outdoor seating is limited and may be reserved for patrons who are purchasing food and/or beverages from the bar and café. Food is not permitted in the theatres. Can we come backstage after the show and meet the cast? Unfortunately not.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support.

At the Theatre How early must I arrive? 2021 lobby opening times are TBD. What should I wear to the theatre? Casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable.

The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres.

Friends supporting at the Supporting level ($200-399) can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information.

Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2021 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols? Please read our Duty of Care. Do I need to wear a mask? All patrons are required to wear a mask during performances even if vaccinated. How early must I arrive? Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. For outdoor performances to make your experience more comfortable please consider bringing the following items: pillows, blankets, sweaters, wraps, bug spray, comfortable shoes – whatever you think will enhance your comfort level. Please note: Coat check is currently unavailable at all venues. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? Please do not bring food into our venues. A bar will be set up for both indoor and outdoor performances so you can enjoy your favourite refreshments. Are the theatres wheelchair accessible? Yes.

Please advise the Box Office representative when ordering your tickets if you, or a member of your party, has concerns about accessibility. I am hearing-impaired. Do your theatres offer amplification? Yes, all Shaw Festival theatres are equipped with Sennheiser Infrared Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening devices can be booked in advance through the Box Office or online when you book your tickets. A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Please note: Assistive Listening Devices are not available for outdoor performances. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Onsite parking will be very limited due to the Nona Macdonald Stage located in the parking lot. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee.

Additional parking is available on the streets (parking is metered) and at Fort George ($). Please be aware of alternate options throughout the town. Parking for the Royal George Theatre (85 Queen Street) is available, metered and non-metered, on the streets surrounding the theatre. Please allow extra time to find a parking space.

Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols?

Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool.

Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols? Please read our Duty of Care. Do I need to wear a mask? All patrons are required to wear a mask during performances even if vaccinated. How early must I arrive? Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. For outdoor performances to make your experience more comfortable please consider bringing the following items: pillows, blankets, sweaters, wraps, bug spray, comfortable shoes – whatever you think will enhance your comfort level. Please note: Coat check is currently unavailable at all venues. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

Assistive listening devices can be booked in advance through the Box Office or online when you book your tickets. A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Please note: Assistive Listening Devices are not available for outdoor performances. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free.

Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2021 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols?

Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2021 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices. This benefit is valid on the first exchange for each ticket and is subject to availability. We require-for the safety of other patrons and our artists - that patrons who are unwell stay home and contact the Box Office to reschedule their visit to The Shaw. Exchange fees will be waived for all cases for illness. Are prices in Canadian or US dollars? All prices are in Canadian dollars. We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols? Please read our Duty of Care. Do I need to wear a mask? All patrons are required to wear a mask during performances even if vaccinated. How early must I arrive? Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. For outdoor performances to make your experience more comfortable please consider bringing the following items: pillows, blankets, sweaters, wraps, bug spray, comfortable shoes – whatever you think will enhance your comfort level. Please note: Coat check is currently unavailable at all venues. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Please note: Assistive Listening Devices are not available for outdoor performances. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2021 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols? Please read our Duty of Care. Do I need to wear a mask? All patrons are required to wear a mask during performances even if vaccinated. How early must I arrive? Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. For outdoor performances to make your experience more comfortable please consider bringing the following items: pillows, blankets, sweaters, wraps, bug spray, comfortable shoes – whatever you think will enhance your comfort level. Please note: Coat check is currently unavailable at all venues. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? Please do not bring food into our venues. A bar will be set up for both indoor and outdoor performances so you can enjoy your favourite refreshments. Are the theatres wheelchair accessible? Yes.

Please advise the Box Office representative when ordering your tickets if you, or a member of your party, has concerns about accessibility. I am hearing-impaired. Do your theatres offer amplification? Yes, all Shaw Festival theatres are equipped with Sennheiser Infrared Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening devices can be booked in advance through the Box Office or online when you book your tickets. A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Please note: Assistive Listening Devices are not available for outdoor performances. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance. Onsite parking will be very limited due to the Nona Macdonald Stage located in the parking lot. Limited parking for people with disabilities is available for the same fee.

Additional parking is available on the streets (parking is metered) and at Fort George ($). Please be aware of alternate options throughout the town. Parking for the Royal George Theatre (85 Queen Street) is available, metered and non-metered, on the streets surrounding the theatre. Please allow extra time to find a parking space.

Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for.

Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols?

Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable.

A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols?

Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. For outdoor performances to make your experience more comfortable please consider bringing the following items: pillows, blankets, sweaters, wraps, bug spray, comfortable shoes – whatever you think will enhance your comfort level. Please note: Coat check is currently unavailable at all venues. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Please note: Assistive Listening Devices are not available for outdoor performances. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance.

Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2021 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly.

Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost.

If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols?

Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool.

Please note: Coat check is currently unavailable at all venues. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres.

Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance.

Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance.

If you lose your tickets or in the event that they have not arrived by mail or email, you can contact the Box Office and we can resend them to you. Tickets can be reprinted at any time, including on the day of the performance. Is there a discount for same day tickets? We do not offer Rush seating; however, you can check with a Box Office representative on the day of the performance to see if there are any promotions you would be eligible for. What if I can’t make it to the show? Can I get a refund or exchange my tickets for another date? Tickets may be exchanged for another performance during the 2021 Season (subject to availability) at least 24 hours before the performance. Any difference in price will be charged accordingly. Prices based on price of tickets at time of exchange. A fee of $4.60 per ticket will apply. Friends Exchange Benefit: Tickets ordered by Friends up to January 31 may be exchanged once for an equivalent section and performance type at no additional cost. Exchange fees are waived and new tickets will not be subject to changes in pricing. Any upgrades (better seating or different performance types) will benefit from early booking prices.

We accept American currency but any change will be given in Canadian dollars. What happens if a show is sold out? Can I get on a waiting list? If a show is sold out we suggest calling the Box Office to check availability as the performance date gets closer. Patrons are able to make exchanges right up until 24 hours before the performance so something may become available. A waiting list is available for Friends at the Supporting level ($200-399) and above. Friends can add their name to the Advanced Wait List prior to the day of the performance. If seats become available, the Box Office will contact you. Unfortunately there is no guarantee that any tickets will become available for a performance. What is a Friend of the Shaw Festival? A Friend of the Shaw Festival is someone who is dedicated to maintaining The Shaw’s long tradition of theatrical excellence by going above and beyond. Many of our patrons recognize that the price of a ticket doesn’t cover the full cost of presenting a production here at The Shaw and choose to add to their support of this Festival by making an annual charitable donation. We are grateful to this amazing group of Friends (formerly called Members) and recognize their generosity through a membership program which provides certain benefits, or privileges, based on the level of support. Can someone else access my account information to make changes to an order? No. In order to access your personal ticketing account, the person attempting to make changes would need to have permission from the account holder. This is to protect your privacy and information. For further information please contact the Box Office. I have a group of people that want to visit Shaw. Are we eligible for a discount? Unfortunately, the Shaw Festival is currently unable to take group orders. For more information please contact groupsales@shawfest.com At the Theatre What are The Shaw's COVID protocols? Please read our Duty of Care. Do I need to wear a mask? All patrons are required to wear a mask during performances even if vaccinated. How early must I arrive? Please arrive no earlier than one hour prior to the performance on the Festival Theatre grounds. Please arrive no earlier than 30 minutes prior to the performance on the Royal George Theatre grounds. What should I wear to the theatre? For indoor performances casual or dress clothes are perfectly acceptable. It would be a good idea to bring a sweater or a shawl with you, in case you find the air conditioned theatres to be a bit cool. For outdoor performances to make your experience more comfortable please consider bringing the following items: pillows, blankets, sweaters, wraps, bug spray, comfortable shoes – whatever you think will enhance your comfort level. Please note: Coat check is currently unavailable at all venues. Are children allowed in the theatre? Can my child sit on my lap? The theatre’s policy is that tickets must be purchased for any child attending a performance, and children must be seated with a parent. Babes-in-arms are not permitted in the theatres. Please contact the Box Office and speak with one of our representatives regarding the content and length of the production to determine if it seems suitable for your child. Should your child become restless during the performance, management may ask you to leave the theatre. Can I text, tweet or take pictures during the show? We invite you to take photos pre-show, at intermission and post-show, but kindly tuck your camera away during the performance. Feel free to share your experience by tagging our social media accounts and using #SHAREYOURSHAW. Can I bring my own food and drink? Please do not bring food into our venues.

A voluntary donation at time of pick up would be greatly appreciated for repair and replacement of these devices. Please note: Assistive Listening Devices are not available for outdoor performances. Can I wear perfume or cologne to the theatre? The Shaw Festival endeavors to make its facilities scent-free. In the interest of other patrons, we ask that you arrive perfume/cologne-free. Can I park at the Festival Theatre? Can I reserve a spot in advance? Parking is available at the Festival and Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatres (10 Queen’s Parade) for a fee of $15 per performance.
